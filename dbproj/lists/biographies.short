NM: 'Til Tuesday

BG: 'Til Tuesday were an excellent and intelligent 80s New Wave rock quartet
BG: from Boston, Massachusetts. The group first got together in 1982. The
BG: band members were: Aimee Mann (vocals/bass), Robert Holmes
BG: (vocals/guitar), Joey Pesce (keyboards), and Michael Hausman (drums).
BG: Their music was distinguished by Mann's beautiful vocals, exceptionally
BG: literate lyrics, thoughtful and mature subject matter, and rich, lovely
BG: melodies. 'Til Tuesday started out playing around the Boston area and
BG: won Boston's WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble battle of the bands contest in
BG: 1983. They subsequently signed with the label Epic Records and released
BG: their debut album "Voices Carry" in 1985. The haunting and poignant
BG: titular tune was a substantial hit single; it peaked at #8 on the
BG: Billboard pop radio charts. The album also sold well; it reached #19 on
BG: the Top 20 album charts. Moreover, the music video for "Voices Carry"
BG: won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Alas, the band's
BG: follow-up 1986 album "Welcome Home" was less successful; it barely
BG: cracked the Top 50 at #49 on the Billboard album charts. The moving
BG: song "What About Love" did a little better; it went all the way to #26
BG: on the Billboard pop radio charts. Although their third and final album
BG: "Everything's Different Now" received positive notices from music
BG: critics in 1988, it nonetheless was a complete commercial flop. 'Til
BG: Tuesday broke up in 1988. Aimee Mann has since gone on to have a hugely
BG: successful solo career while Michael Hausman serves as Mann's manager.

NM: 1, Todd

RN: Todd A. Brown

DB: 24 May 1970, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA

HT: 5' 7 1/2"

BG: Todd-1 is ready to take on the new millennium and prove to the
BG: entertainment world that his early success was no flash in the pan.
BG: From MTV to BET to ABC to Source All Access (Nationally Syndicated) to
BG: Interscope Presents the Next Episode (on Showtime), the multi-talented
BG: producer has paid his dues and the payoff is set for the year 2004.
BG: Born Todd Brown, the Brooklyn native showed early promise during his
BG: school years and definitely stood out amongst the crowd. He lists early
BG: rap stars KRS-One and LL Cool J as major musical influences and by age
BG: 16, he had begun to rap professionally. But although he desired a music
BG: career, Todd went off to college.
BG: 
BG: While studying Cable and Corporate Communications, Todd got his first
BG: taste of Television production. He took everything from `Speech' to
BG: `Remote TV Production' to `Physics of Music'. One day a fellow student
BG: came into class wearing a suit and told him about an internship
BG: interview that he was going to. He gave him the phone number and his
BG: call led to an internship with a growing company called MTV.
BG: 
BG: Rising from intern to production assistant to associate producer, Todd
BG: knew that he found his niche. He quickly bonded with Ted Demme, who
BG: took him on as his apprentice. During this time, the music world was
BG: revving its engines and the rise of prominent hip-hop and R&B groups
BG: were beginning to take over the charts. The show, MTV's 'Fade to Black'
BG: (which would later spawn the hit show 'MTV Jams') achieved strong
BG: ratings with Todd himself as the offbeat host, proved to be a real
BG: learning experience. Having worked with such premiere artists as
BG: Babyface, Janet Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal, TLC and Queen Latifah, it
BG: was a short time before he received the call to work at BET. Although
BG: he spent less than two years there, BET proved to be another stepping
BG: stone for the passionate Todd-1.
BG: 
BG: After a brief stint setting up the foundation for a Mike Tyson record
BG: label, Todd hooked up with friend and NBA star Derrick Coleman to form
BG: 44 Ways entertainment. Described it as a `full-service entertainment
BG: conglomerate which will catered to Music, Television and Film' Todd-1
BG: had his plate full running the day to day operations. 2 years later,
BG: Todd returned to his roots as a Producer of Hip Hop Television shows
BG: taking on the post of Supervising Producer at the nationally syndicated
BG: show - "Source All Access". It was during the hiatus of this show that
BG: he wrote his first screenplay entitled "Money Boys".
BG: 
BG: Currently Todd is the Producer of "Interscope Presents The Next
BG: Episode", airing on Showtime Networks. This is the first of its kind,
BG: Hip Hip docu-drama delving into the lives of future rap stars. Todd has
BG: relocated to Los Angeles and is looking forward to the upcoming
BG: challenges that await.

NM: 40 Glocc

BG: Cali rapper 40 Glocc is living the dream. He is signed to a deal with
BG: lifetime friends Mobb Deep - with whom he is about to embark on a
BG: national tour - on Infamous/G-Unit Records. He's recording his first
BG: album under that deal with some of the top producers in the business
BG: (Dr Dre, Alchemist, Havoc) and is traveling to places in the world he
BG: once only dreamed of seeing. It would seem that he has everything right
BG: now that an aspiring artist could ever want, and that is certainly
BG: true; but it certainly wasn't always that way. This is definitely no
BG: overnight success story.
BG: 
BG: Born as Tory Gasaway in Galveston, Texas, 40 Glocc didn't know his
BG: mother until the age of 8. Instead, he was raised by his grandparents
BG: in Beaumont, along with 14 other children. His father was never around
BG: much either. During those eight years, 40 only knew his mother, and a
BG: younger sister he had never met, by the pictures his grandparents
BG: showed him. He only knew that they lived in California and that one
BG: day, his mother was coming to get him. His grandmother told him so.
BG: 
BG: She did in fact come to get him and moved him to the MacArthur Park area
BG: of Downtown Los Angeles. 40 was so glad to see her and his sister, and
BG: he just knew that life was going to get better now that his family was
BG: reunited. After a time the family relocated to Colton City, San
BG: Bernadino, to an area also known as "The Zoo" and the problems at home
BG: began. 40 and his mother didn't get along at all. He didn't feel that
BG: she cared at all about what happened to him. His new friends did though
BG: and 40 started spending all of his time with them. His friends,
BG: unfortunately, were all members of the Colton City Crips. The deeper 40
BG: got into that lifestyle, and its ensuing traps, the worse things became
BG: at home. Finally, at the age of 13, 40 left home for good, choosing
BG: instead to sleep in the cars of friends, or outside of grocery stores
BG: with the bums. It was a life he became adept at dealing with. His role
BG: models and father figures, such as they were, were gang bangers and
BG: drug dealers and 40 learned to survive through them and live by their
BG: street code, reaping all the rewards such a life inevitably has in
BG: store. Among other things, 40 was shot several times, ending up in a
BG: wheelchair for many months after one such incident during which he was
BG: shot by police. He finally caught a case from a home invasion charge he
BG: didn't commit. A charge it took him six months to beat.
BG: 
BG: Through all of this though, 40 did have a dream. He also had a talent,
BG: that of rapping, and of telling vivid stories of the things he had been
BG: through and of his life on the streets. Narratives that people could
BG: relate to. People like him. Word didn't take long to reach the right
BG: ears; the streets are like that. By '97 group The Zoo Crew (40 Glocc,
BG: K-9 and Natural Born) had formed and were dropping their first album
BG: "Migrate, Adapt or Die" produced by Tony and Julio G. The album became
BG: an underground hit and 40 was recognized as one of the best hidden
BG: talents in the streets. Soon he was an integral part of the scene and
BG: recording with his West Coast peers. It was his manager and long-time
BG: friend Storm though that negotiated his first solo deal with Empire
BG: Music Werks who were distributed by BMG. It was through this deal that
BG: 40 Glocc released his first solo effort, "The Jackal" which featured a
BG: who's who list of West Coast talent - Ras Kass, Bad Azz, Kurupt, Spice
BG: 1 and Tray Dee - and production from the best Cali had to offer;
BG: long-time supporter Dr Dre, Battle Cat and Protégé. Empire didn't have
BG: their promotion game up to snuff though and after sinking much of what
BG: he had been advanced back into promoting the album himself, 40 decided
BG: to go his own way.
BG: 
BG: At this time, manager Storm's other act, Mobb Deep had been making a lot
BG: of noise since their debut "Infamous" on Jive and it was only natural
BG: that they would take an interest in the career of their friend. First
BG: instincts said get 40 a deal at Jive but conversations went nowhere and
BG: Storm began to shop 40 Glocc at the other majors. Unfortunately, the
BG: West Coast had lost their hold on the rap game and no one wanted to
BG: take a chance that a West Coast artist could sell. It was a set-back,
BG: as was Jive's dropping of Mobb Deep but as life often so does, things
BG: took a sudden turn for the great. Mobb Deep was signed to G-Unit and
BG: suddenly they and their friend 40 Glocc were running around with rap's
BG: finest. This was a home 40 could live with and it wasn't long before
BG: that became a reality; he signed to Mobb Deep's imprint Infamous under
BG: G-Unit. Some things have remained the same however. 40 is still
BG: recording with Dr Dre and he is still writing stories that people his
BG: can relate to. That is his goal. To give hope with his lyrics to people
BG: who are coming up through some of what he has already lived to tell. To
BG: let them know that they too can achieve their dream. To believe in
BG: themselves when there is no one else to believe in you.
BG: 
BG: 40 Glocc is pursuing acting as well. He recently wrapped a supporting
BG: role in a feature film entitled "Playboys" from directors Zach Cregger
BG: and Trevor Moore ("The Whitest Kids U Know"). He's also featured in a
BG: new AFI (American Film Institute) short film called "The Second Half".
BG: Being a part of a prestigious AFI Film was a great experience for him.
BG: 40 Glocc has also appeared in other feature films such as "Thicker Than
BG: Blood", "Book Of Love" and Snoop Dogg's "Tha Eastsidaz".
BG: 
BG: With what he has already accomplished, what are some of 40 Glocc's other
BG: dreams? To make an album that touches peoples' souls. He feels that
BG: what he is recording now is his best work ever. He knows he can't rap
BG: forever though. He also hopes to make his label Zoo Life something he
BG: can grow old with. After all, right now, just the thought that he has
BG: made it to a point in his life where he probably will live to grow old
BG: is a major blessing.

NM: 50 Cent

RN: Curtis James Jackson III

NK: Interscope

NK: Boo Boo

DB: 6 July 1975, Queens, New York City, New York, USA

HT: 6'

BG: Born in the South Jamaica section of Queens, Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson
BG: has lived in New York City all his life. Raised by his grandparents
BG: after his father ran out and his mother was shot when he was only
BG: eight. Growing up, the Queens rapper originally wanted to be a
BG: heavyweight boxer, but eventually fell back on rapping. DJs had taken
BG: it upon themselves to release two Best of 50 Cent mix CDs, before he
BG: had even signed to a major label. 50 Cent hit the scene with "How To
BG: Rob An Industry Nigga" and he's been on a rampage ever since dealing
BG: with bootleggers, label back stabbing and other platinum selling
BG: artists trying to get at him physically. In 1999 his album Power of the
BG: Dollar, was heavily bootlegged and Trackmasters/Columbia never released
BG: it. Supposedly, Trackmasters weren't comfortable with him being caught
BG: up in the streets and getting shot three days before filming the video
BG: for "Thug Love," (with Destiny's Child) -- his first single. 50 was
BG: shot three times that night, two shots hitting him in the head, the
BG: bullet that struck his face he carries as a reminder of what happened.
BG: That event led to the fall out with Columbia and negotiating his
BG: release from their grasps. He still showed love and rhymed over a
BG: Trackmasters produced remix of "I'm Gonna Be Alright" on J-Lo's latest
BG: album, but rivals at Murder Inc. had 50 cut from the track which could
BG: have launched the rapper. This all changed in one night when Eminem
BG: said on a radio show that "50 Cent is definitely my favorite rapper
BG: right now, he's the only one keeping it real." The very next day a
BG: bidding war started on 50, ending when 50 signed to Eminem's very own
BG: label Shady/Aftermath. 50 Cent's fame has exploded, being produced by
BG: Dr. Dre and Eminem and finally making his debut album "Get rich or Die
BG: Tryin'." 50 has full access and advantage of the streets through
BG: mix-tapes; that's his forum because he controls it. 50 Cent is the most
BG: anticipated artist of 2003. It's well deserved because he's "been
BG: patiently waiting."

QU: * The only thing that I'm scared of is not livin' up to the expectations

QU: * [on his feud with rapper 'Ja Rule' (qv)] Right now he's desperate. He
QU:   should be talking about me, not 'Eminem' (qv) and ['Dr. Dre' (qv)] and
QU:   everybody else. He'll lose, he knows that. The route that he has to
QU:   take is the "I'm a mad gangsta" hardcore route, and ain't nobody gonna

QU: * I think it's easier for the general public to embrace me in a negative
QU:   way. You have people who already have a perception of me that says I'm
QU:   a bad person.
QU: * I don't display emotions. I have every feeling that everyone else has
QU:   but I've developed ways to suppress them. Anger is one of my most
QU:   comfortable feelings.
QU: * In my neighborhood if you're too aggressive, you intimidate someone,
QU:   they kill you. Or if you decide to be emotional and you start crying,
QU:   you're a victim. You know, the kid in the schoolyard that doesn't want
QU:   to fight always leaves with a black eye. You have to find a way to stay
QU:   in the middle, somewhere where people just don't mess with you because
QU:   they know that you don't have a problem with it if it goes there.

NM: A Taste of Honey

BG: A Taste of Honey was a funk/disco/R&B band from Los Angeles, California.
BG: The group first formed in 1971. The line-up was:
BG: 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) (guitar/bass/vocals), 'Hazel Payne' (qv)
BG: (guitar/vocals), Perry Kibble (keyboards) and Donald Ray Johnson
BG: (drums). A Taste of Honey started out playing at various clubs in
BG: Southern California and at American military bases in both the United
BG: States and abroad (the band did USO tours in such places as Spain,
BG: Alaska, Thailand, Morocco and Japan). The group were discovered by
BG: Capitol Records in 1976 and signed up with the label two years later.
BG: They scored a massive smash in 1978 with the infectiously funky disco
BG: song "Boogie Oogie Oogie", which peaked at #1 on the Billboard pop
BG: charts for three consecutive weeks, sold over two million copies, and
BG: earned the group a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on February 15,
BG: 1979. The follow-up song, "Do It Good", was a #13 hit on the R&B radio
BG: charts. By 1980, the band had become a duo consisting of only
BG: 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) and 'Hazel Payne' (qv). In 1981, A Taste of
BG: Honey had another huge success with their cover of the lovely Japanese
BG: ballad "Sukiyaki", which soared to #1 on the R&B radio charts and
BG: climbed all the way to #3 on the Billboard pop charts. The band broke
BG: up in the early 80s. 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) went on to pursue a
BG: solo career, 'Hazel Payne' (qv) became an international stage actress,
BG: Donald Ray Johnson has recorded several blues albums and continues to
BG: play the drums (he's also a well-known blues singer/drummer in Western
BG: Canada), and Perry Kibble sadly died of heart failure at the tragically
BG: young age of 49 in 1999. In 2004, Janice Marie Johnson and Hazel Payne
BG: reunited to perform on the PBS TV specials
BG: _Get Down Tonight: The Disco Explosion (2004) (TV)_ (qv) and
BG: _My Music: Funky Soul Superstars (2005) (TV)_ (qv).

BY: woodyanders

TR: * The band's big hit song "Boogie Oogie Oogie" was inspired by an
TR:   especially tough and unresponsive audience that the group was
TR:   performing live for at an American military base. 'Hazel Payne' (qv)
TR:   yelled to the hostile crowd, "If you think you're too cool to boogie,
TR:   we've got news for you! Everyone here tonight is going to boogie, and
TR:   you're no exception to the rule!". 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv)
TR:   subsequently wrote what Payne shouted down as the opening lyrics for
TR:   the song while Perry Kibble came up with a funky bass line to accompany
TR:   said lyrics.
TR: * The band took their unusual name from the song "A Taste of Honey", which
TR:   was a hit for 'Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass' (qv) in 1965.

BG: As Rusty, the boy whose parents were killed by Indians and who was
BG: subsequently adopted by a cavalry unit at Fort Apache on the popular
BG: adventure _"The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin" (1954)_ (qv), tyke actor Lee
BG: Aaker left a lasting mark in the early days of television, but he had
BG: in fact appeared in several major films prior to this series.
BG: 
BG: He was born on September 25, 1943, in Los Angeles, where his mother
BG: owned a dance studio. On TV almost from infancy, he started appearing
BG: in unbilled film bits at the age of eight in such classics as
BG: _The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)_ (qv) and _High Noon (1952)_ (qv).
BG: He quickly moved to featured status before year's end. He showed
BG: promise as the kidnapped Indian "Red Chief" in a segment of the film
BG: _Full House (1952/I)_ (qv) and another kidnap victim as the son of
BG: scientist 'Gene Barry' (qv) in _Atomic City (1952)_. From there he
BG: co-starred in the 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) western classic
BG: _Hondo (1953)_ (qv) as the inquisitive blond son of homesteader
BG: 'Geraldine Page' (qv), and appeared to good advantage in other movies
BG: such as the film noir thriller _Jeopardy (1953)_ (qv) with
BG: 'Barbara Stanwyck' (qv), the hoss opera drama _Arena (1953)_ (qv) with
BG: 'Gig Young' (qv) and the comedies _Mister Scoutmaster (1953)_ (qv) with
BG: 'Clifton Webb' (qv) and _Ricochet Romance (1954)_ (qv) with
BG: 'Marjorie Main' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Stardom, however, was assured after nabbing the role of the famous dog's
BG: young master on the "Rin Tin Tin" series. After the show's demise,
BG: however, Aaker did not survive the transition into adult roles. He
BG: instead moved into the production end of the business, serving as an
BG: assistant to producer 'Herbert B. Leonard' (qv) on the
BG: _"Route 66" (1960)_ (qv) series, then later dropped out altogether to
BG: become a carpenter. He still attends nostalgia conventions and was

BG: Annika Aakjær is a Danish singer/songwriter/actress. She's mainly known
BG: for her career as a singer - and for her fantastic stage-performance -
BG: which is a mix of her songs and stand-up comedy between the songs. She
BG: studied at Aalborghus Gymnasium, but dropped out to - as she says -
BG: study life instead.
BG: 
BG: She released her first album "Lille filantrop" ("Little philanthropist")
BG: in 2008, and her second album "Missinær" ("Missionary") in 2010 on
BG: Playground Records. Both produced by Henrik Marstal. Both albums were
BG: very well received by Danish reviewers. Five and six stars pretty much
BG: all over, but none of the albums gave her a massive radio-hit. "Tyk"
BG: ("Fat") from the first album gave her enough attention to fill the
BG: small concert-halls, and the title-track from "Missionær" was a regular
BG: on the national Danish radio a few months after release. A third album
BG: will be released in 2012.
BG: 
BG: In 2009 she won the acclaimed award "Steppeulven" as best, upcoming act.
BG: 
BG: Annika was cast for the world's first theatre-musical "Come Together",
BG: entirely based on The Beatles songs. Also here she gained great
BG: success, and were referred to as a "main attraction" in the show in a
BG: TV review. Her acting-career includes various small parts, until
BG: landing the role as Daimi in the 2011 film about the Danish comedian
BG: and actor Dirch Passer.

DB: 16 January 1979, Brooklyn, New York, USA

DD: 25 August 2001, Marsh Harbour, Abaco Island, Bahamas (airplane crash)

HT: 5' 7 1/2"

BG: Talented. Beautiful. Modest. These three words described R&B
BG: singer-turned-actress Aaliyah perfectly. Born in Brooklyn, New York but
BG: raised in Detroit, Aaliyah got her first major exposure appearing on
BG: the syndicated television series _"Star Search" (1983)_ (qv) where she
BG: awed the audience with her amazing voice and talent. Withdrawing from
BG: the celebrity scene for a few years, Aaliyah lived the life of a normal
BG: teenage girl, attending Detroit's Performing Arts High School where she
BG: majored in dance. It was around this same time that Aaliyah met
BG: singer/composer 'R. Kelly' (qv). Kelly assisted Aaliyah with the
BG: production of her debut album "Age Ain't Nothing But A number" which
BG: scored several number hits, specifically "Back and Forth." The album's
BG: title was a brief reference to her short-lived marriage to
BG: 'R. Kelly' (qv) (she was 15 years of age at the time, and he was in his
BG: 20s). Thir marriage was annulled due to her status as a minor. During
BG: her senior year, Aaliyah went on to record "One In A Million" which
BG: featured the songwriting talents of major R&B producers/writers 'Missy
BG: 'Misdemeanor' Elliott' (qv) and 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv). That album was a
BG: major success and sealed Aaliyah's fame forever. After seeing her at an
BG: awards show and in the video for her hit song "Are You that Somebody?"
BG: (from the 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) film _Doctor Dolittle (1998)_ (qv)),
BG: film producer 'Joel Silver (I)' (qv) (producer of
BG: _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv) and other major actor films) asked Aaliyah to
BG: audition for a role in an upcoming romance/action film called
BG: _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv). With her determination and sex appeal,
BG: Aaliyah won Silver over and was cast in her first major film role.
BG: _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv) was a hit at the box office. This film led
BG: to her being cast as one of the stars of the film based on
BG: 'Anne Rice (I)' (qv)'s _Queen of the Damned (2002)_ (qv) and in the two
BG: sequels to the major box office hit, _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv). During
BG: the busy schedule of her film career, Aaliyah took time to record her
BG: third album, the self-titled "Aaliyah". July 2001 was a busy time for
BG: Aaliyah. After the sucess of her song "Try Again" for which she was
BG: nominated for a Grammy Award and won several MTV Video Awards, Aaliyah
BG: finally released her "Aaliyah" album. Debuting at number two on the
BG: Billboard charts, "Aaliyah" was a sales success despite many
BG: lack-lustre reviews it received. In August 2001, Aaliyah took time off
BG: from her busy album promotional tour to fly to the Bahamas to film a
BG: video for the song "Rock the Boat". The video, filmed on Abaco Island,
BG: was directed by 'Hype Williams' (qv), a major music video director
BG: known for his style and wit. On August 25, 2001, after filming the
BG: video, Aaliyah and about 9-11 of her entourage took off from Marsh
BG: Harbour airport at 6:50pm EDT in a small Cessna 404 en route to
BG: Opa-Locka, Florida. A few minutes after take-off, the plane crashed
BG: about 200 feet from the runaway killing Aaliyah and many others
BG: instantly. Four passnegers were pulled alive from the wreckage, and one
BG: later died at a hospital in Nassau. Aaliyah was only 22 years old.
BG: Aaliyah's short-lived, but brillant career was a true success story for
BG: a young African-American woman who went against all odds to be herself
BG: in an industry where originality is scarce. Truly missed by her family,
BG: friends, and fans, her music and film contributions will live forever.

BG: On January 16th 1979 the world was blessed with the birth of Aaliyah
BG: Dana Haughton in Brooklyn, New York. Aaliyah was raised by her father,
BG: mother and brother 'Rashad Haughton' (qv) in Detroit. At age 9 she

BG: Vegas. In 1992, she began to work on her debut album with the help of
BG: singer 'R. Kelly' (qv). The album, "Age Ain't Nothing But A Number" was

BG: shortly after when reports suggested she was married to

BG: apparently annulled. In 1995, she began to work on her 2nd album,
BG: alongside 'Jermaine Dupri' (qv), 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv),
BG: 'Slick Rick (I)' (qv) and Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott'. The album,
BG: titled 'One In A Million' was released on August 27th 1996. In 1998 she
BG: released the single, 'Are you that somebody?' from the
BG: _Doctor Dolittle (1998)_ (qv) soundtrack, it was produced by her
BG: friends 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv). Later that year she released the single
BG: 'Journey to the past', from the _Anastasia (1997)_ (qv) soundtrack. In
BG: 2000, she made her film acting debut and starred as Trish O'Day in the
BG: smash hit, hip-hop, kung fu film, _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv)
BG: alongside 'Jet Li' (qv). The producer was so impressed by her
BG: performance she got parts in _The Matrix Reloaded (2003)_ (qv) and
BG: _The Matrix Revolutions (2003)_ (qv). She made numerous records for the
BG: soundtrack and released 'Try Again', for which she was nominated with
BG: 'Best female video' and 'Best Video in a film' with MTV. In 2001 she
BG: was nominated with 2 awards for MTV, the 'Breakthrough female' and
BG: 'best performing female'. In July 2001 she released her third album,
BG: the self-titled, 'Aaliyah'. In early August of the same year she filmed
BG: the video for the single 'More Than a woman', taken off the album and
BG: on the 23rd August she started filming for 'Rock The Boat', on Abaco
BG: Island, in the Bahamas. On 25th August, filming was completed and her
BG: and eight of her crew members including her hair stylist and bodyguard
BG: boarded a small plane. Shortly after take off, the plane crashed and
BG: exploded, Aaliyah and all on board, perished. Aaliyah's funeral was
BG: held on Friday August 31st in New York, and 22 white doves were flown
BG: to celebrate each year of her life. Soon after her death, the hit
BG: singles 'More Than a woman' and 'Rock The Boat' were released from her
BG: third album. In 2002, the film _Queen of the Damned (2002)_ (qv) by
BG: 'Anne Rice (I)' (qv) was released in which Aaliyah played the lead,
BG: Queen Akasha. She was nominated for best Villain at the MTV movie
BG: awards 2002. Looking back at her biography, it's no wonder her name
BG: means 'Highest, most exhalted one; the best', she had achieved so much
BG: in her short life of 22 years.

QU: * [interview in July 2001 with Germany's "Die Zeit" newspaper that eerily
QU:   predicts her death] It is dark in my favorite dream. Someone is
QU:   following me. I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off.
QU:   Far away. How do I feel? As if I am swimming in the air. Free.
QU:   Weightless. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful
QU:   feeling.
QU: * [from "MTV Diary: Aaliyah"] want people to remember me as a full-on
QU:   entertainer and a good person.
QU: * It's hard to say what I want my legacy to be when I'm long gone.
QU: * [her advice for aspiring artists) Keep working hard and you can get
QU:   anything that you want. If God gave you the talent, you should go for
QU:   it. But don't think it's going to be easy. It's hard!
QU: * Everything is worth it. The hard work, the times when you're tired, the
QU:   times where you're a bit sad . . . In the end, it's all worth it
QU:   because it really makes me happy. There's nothing better than loving
QU:   what you do.
QU: * Sensual is being in tune with your sensual self.
QU: * When I'm long gone, I want to be remembered not just as an actress or
QU:   singer, but as a full-on entertainer.
QU: * [on her inspirations]: Sade. How beautiful is she? I chose her because I
QU:   idolize her. I've always looked up to her. She and I have the same
QU:   birthday which is January 16th so I feel like she is my soul sister.
QU:   What I love about Sade is that she stays true to her style no matter
QU:   what. She can leave us for 8 years and come back and be absolutely mind
QU:   blowing. And you gotta respect that.
QU: * Being female, you're raised to be a good, sweet girl and not flip out.
QU:   So I had to give myself permission to be mean and evil. It's tough. But
QU:   I've always been drawn to the darker side of things.

NM: Aalto, Alvar

RN: Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto

DB: 3 February 1898, Kuortane, Finland

DD: 11 May 1976, Helsinki, Finland

BG: Alvar Aalto, one of Finland's most famous people who reshaped
BG: architecture and furniture of public buildings on the basis of
BG: functionality and organic relationship between man, nature and
BG: buildings, is now called the "Father of Modernism" in Scandinavian
BG: countries.
BG: 
BG: He was born Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto, on February 3, 1898, in Kuortane,
BG: Finland (at that time Finland was part of Russian Empire). He was the
BG: first of three children. His father, J. H. Aalto, was a government
BG: surveyor. His mother, Selma Hackestedt, was of Swedish ancestry, she
BG: died in 1903. His father remarried and moved the family to the town of
BG: Jyvaskyla. There young Aalto attended the Normal School and the
BG: Classical Gymnasium, graduating in 1916. During the summer months,
BG: young Aalto accompanied his father on surveying trips. From 1916-1921
BG: he studied at the Helsinki University of technology, graduating with a
BG: degree in architecture. While a student, Aalto worked for Carolus
BG: Lindberg on the design of the "Tivoli" area for the 1920 National Fair.
BG: At that time Aalto was a protégé of Armas Lingren, partner of E.
BG: Saarinen during the formative period of Finnish National architecture
BG: of Romanticism. Aalto served in the Finnish National Militia during the
BG: Civil War that followed after the Russian Revolution, when the nation
BG: of Finland gained independence from Russia.
BG: 
BG: In 1922-1923 Aalto worked for a project in Sweden, he collaborated with
BG: A. Bjerke on the design of the Congress Hall for the 1923 World Fair in
BG: Goteborg. He also designed several buildings for the 1922 Industrial
BG: fair in Tampere. In 1923 Aalto opened his first architectural office in
BG: Juvaskyla. In 1924 he married architect Aino Marsio, they had two
BG: children, Johanna (born 1925), and Hamilkar (born 1928). Aalto and his
BG: wife had their honeymoon in Italy. The Mediterranean culture made a
BG: profound influence on Aalto's creativity, it blended with his Nordic
BG: intellect and remained important to his visionary works for the rest of
BG: his life. The simple massing and ornamentation of the "architettura
BG: mirwire" of Northern Italy translated into Aalto's style with its
BG: balanced proportions, harmonious volumes rendered in stucco or wood,
BG: and sparse decoration with selective use of classical elements. In 1927
BG: the Aaltos moved to the city of Turku. There Alvar Aalto designed the
BG: Paimio Sanatorium, a building that elevated him to the status of master
BG: of heroic functionalism. He soon moved forward in his pursuit of
BG: artistic harmony through organic integration of people and buildings
BG: with the environment. Such was his design for the Villa Mairea (1938)
BG: in Noormarkku, one of the most admired private residences in
BG: contemporary architecture.
BG: 
BG: In 1933 Aalto moved to Helsinki. There he founded his architecture firm
BG: "Artek" where he executed his major international commissions, such as
BG: Finnish Pavilions for the 1936 Paris World Fair and the 1939-1940 New
BG: York's World Fair, libraries in Oregon, USA, and Finland, Opera House
BG: in Essen, Germany. His other significant buildings included Baker House
BG: at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., USA,
BG: Central University Hospital in Zagreb, Croatia, Helsinki Institute of
BG: Technology, North Utland Art Museum in Denmark, Nordic House in
BG: Reykjavic, Iceland, Public Library in Vyborg, (now Russia), and many
BG: other buildings. His later masterpieces include the municipal building
BG: in Sayanasalo (1952), the Vuoksenniska Church (1959) and the Finlandia
BG: Hall in Helsinki. His works exhibit a range of innovative ideas
BG: presented with comforting clarity and carefully crafted balance of
BG: intricate and complex forms, spaces, and elements, that are integrated
BG: in a simple and well-proportioned way. Aalto's design for the Finnish
BG: Pavilion at the 1939 New York's World Fair was described as "work of
BG: genius" by 'Frank Lloyd Wright' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Functionalism and synthetic attitude were important in Aalto's evolution
BG: from Nordic Classicism towards Modernism. He created his own way of
BG: converging forms, materials, and purpose of his buildings on the
BG: rationale of their functionality, aesthetics, and comfortable use.
BG: Aalto's architecture, furniture, glassware and jewelery evokes multiple
BG: allusions to images of unspoiled nature, thus making an ennobling
BG: influence on public behavior. He designed 70 buildings for the town of
BG: Jyvaskyla, 37 of which were realized, such as the Institute of Pedagogy
BG: (1953-1957) and other public buildings. Aalto's ecological awareness
BG: was epitomized in his design of the Sunila Cellulose Industry and the
BG: residential village for employees (1936 - 1939) and its second stage
BG: (1951 - 1954). Aalto's creativity was deeply rooted in his own organic
BG: way of life, traditional for the people in Scandinavian countries. "The
BG: very essence of architecture consists of a variety and development
BG: reminiscent of natural organic life. This is the only true style in
BG: architecture" said Alvar Aalto.
BG: 
BG: Alvo Aalto was Chairman of the Arcitects Union and President of the
BG: Finnish Academy. His latest building for the Art Museum in Jyvaskyla
BG: was named after him. His awards included the Royal Gold Medal from the
BG: Royal Institute of British Architects (1957) and the Gold Medal from
BG: the American Institute of Architects (1963). Alvar Aalto was featured
BG: on the last series of the 50 Finnish mark bill, before the Euro. He
BG: died of natural causes on May 11, 1976, in Helsinki and was laid to
BG: rest in Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki, Finland.

BG: Angela Aames grew up in Pierre, South Dakota. She acted in high school
BG: and attended the University of South Dakota before coming to Hollywood
BG: in 1978 to begin her acting career. Her first film role was as Little
BG: Bo Peep in the film _Fairy Tales (1978)_ (qv). She followed that up by
BG: playing Linda "Boom-Boom" Bang in _H.O.T.S. (1979)_ (qv). Other film
BG: roles included _...All the Marbles (1981)_ (qv),
BG: _Scarface (1983)_ (qv), _Bachelor Party (1984)_ (qv),
BG: _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), _Basic Training (1985)_ (qv), and
BG: _Chopping Mall (1986)_ (qv). She did guest appearances on several
BG: television shows, including _"Cheers" (1982)_ (qv) and
BG: _"Night Court" (1984)_ (qv). Her last role was as Penny, a fitness
BG: instructor, on _"The Dom DeLuise Show" (1987)_ (qv). Angela was found
BG: dead at a friend's home in West Hills in the San Fernando Valley on
BG: November 27, 1988. The coroner later ruled that her death was a result
BG: of a deterioration of the heart muscle, probably caused by a virus. She
BG: was 32 at the time.

BY: Don Nelsen <kpaden@cobweb.net>

BG: Beautiful, buxom blond Angela Aames made her mark in Hollywood during
BG: the late 1970s and 1980s while appearing in a string of silly T & A
BG: comedies and exploitation movies. Additionally, she appeared on
BG: numerous TV shows in sexy bit parts that sadly amounted to little more
BG: than window dressing.
BG: 
BG: While she aspired to be a comedienne, her ample curves made her most
BG: suitable to play the series of voluptuous party girls and sex kittens
BG: that eventually would comprise her resume.
BG: 
BG: Angela was born February 27, 1956. An early resume indicates that,
BG: early, her thespian training included stints at the
BG: 'Lee Strasberg' (qv) Theatre Institute and 'Harvey Lembeck' (qv)'s
BG: Comedy Workshop, and stage appearances in such theatrical fare as "Of
BG: Mice and Men", "The Lion in Winter", "A Midsummer Nights Dream", "The
BG: Importance of Being Earnest", "Tartuffe", "The Pleasure of his
BG: Company", "Dark of the Moon" and "The Women".
BG: 
BG: In addition to Angela's verified credits as published at IMDb, her
BG: resume lists a number of other appearances in film and television
BG: including the 20-minute educational short called "Malice in Bigotland"
BG: as well as an industrial short for G.T.E. that dealt with sexual
BG: harassment. Also listed are appearances on the Telethon for Autistic
BG: Children and Krofft Supershows.
BG: 
BG: Her television work included bit parts in shows like
BG: _"Barnaby Jones" (1973)_ (qv), _"Angie" (1979)_ (qv),
BG: _"Out of the Blue" (1979)_ (qv), _"Mork & Mindy" (1978)_ (qv),
BG: _"Hill Street Blues" (1981)_ (qv), _"Cheers" (1982)_ (qv),
BG: _"Automan" (1983)_ (qv) and _"Alice" (1976)_ (qv), in addition to her
BG: recurring appearances on _"B.J. and the Bear" (1978)_ (qv),
BG: _"The Fall Guy" (1981)_ (qv) and _"Night Court" (1984)_ (qv). All
BG: featured Angela in tight outfits with copious amounts of cleavage on
BG: display. In her _"Cheers" (1982)_ (qv) appearance, in the episode
BG: called _"Cheers" (1982) {Sam's Women (#1.2)}_ (qv), Angela plays her
BG: "bimbo" role with such skill that her spelling of her name,
BG: "Brandee-with two E's", is the show's funniest and most memorable line.
BG: 
BG: In 1983, she appeared on Cinemax's
BG: _Likely Stories, Vol. 4 (1983) (TV)_ (qv), playing an 80-foot tall,
BG: bikini-clad giantess.
BG: 
BG: Her earliest film role appears to have been _Fairy Tales (1978)_ (qv),
BG: in which she plays a sexier "Little Bo Peep" than you've probably seen
BG: before. Angela briefly appeared nude in this film, and clips of her
BG: nude scene later appeared in made-for-video compilations like
BG: _The Best of Sex and Violence (1981)_ (qv) and
BG: _Famous T & A (1982) (V)_ (qv). Taking one look at her, Angela was
BG: simply made to play the part of Linda "Boom Boom" Bangs in
BG: _H.O.T.S. (1979)_ (qv), which had her skydiving topless into a swimming
BG: pool, among other exploits that made effective use of her frontal
BG: anatomy. Her resume also lists an otherwise unknown film from this
BG: period, called "The Crazy".
BG: 
BG: Angela appeared in bit parts a number of made-for-TV movies in 1980-81
BG: appearances, which mostly showcased her figure and which included
BG: "Moviola" (aka _This Year's Blonde (1980) (TV)_ (qv)),
BG: _Charlie and the Great Balloon Chase (1981) (TV)_ (qv),
BG: _The Comeback Kid (1980) (TV)_ (qv) and
BG: _The Perfect Woman (1981) (TV)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: The early 1980s saw her topless again in
BG: _...All the Marbles (1981)_ (qv). She also appeared, briefly, in
BG: _Boxoffice (1982)_ (qv), as a pregnant Hollywood starlet at a posh
BG: dinner party. In 1983, Angela had a non-speaking walk-through part in
BG: _Scarface (1983)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: In 1984, she had arguably her most memorable moment on-screen, in the
BG: now-cult classic 'Tom Hanks' (qv) vehicle _Bachelor Party (1984)_ (qv).
BG: During the film's opening credits, Aames appears in
BG: 'Adrian Zmed' (qv)'s photography studio as a mother having baby
BG: pictures taken of her infant child. With a red "come get me" top cut
BG: practically to her navel, she made indelible impressions on legions of
BG: adoring male fans.
BG: 
BG: Her later film roles, in the mid to late 1980s, included
BG: 'Jim Wynorski' (qv)'s _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv),
BG: _Basic Training (1985)_ (qv) and _Chopping Mall (1986)_ (qv).
BG: _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), in particular, allowed Angela to take
BG: more of a leading role, demonstrating her fine flair for comedy in
BG: addition to her big breasts. There are also some vague Internet
BG: references to an appearance in a 1988 "documentary" on bodybuilding
BG: called "Flex" (1988), and also starring Harry Grant and
BG: 'Tom Platz' (qv). This is certainly plausible, as Angela had reportedly
BG: taken up weightlifting in the years just before her untimely death.
BG: 
BG: In 1988, she had secured a starring role in the weekly sit-com
BG: _"The Dom DeLuise Show" (1987)_ (qv), in which she portrayed an
BG: aerobics instructor who frequented the beauty and barber shop around
BG: which the show revolved. During the show's pilot episode, she made a
BG: spectacular entrance, clad in a skin tight leotard, during which
BG: 'Dom DeLuise' (qv) commented, to the audience, "I just love watching
BG: her jog!"
BG: 
BG: In addition to her numerous TV and film appearances, Angela occasionally
BG: modeled. Notably, she was a "Mint 400 Girl" in 1982. The "Mint 400
BG: Girls" were glamorous race beauty queens integrally involved in the
BG: publicity for the prestigious Mint 400 Las Vegas off-road race. She has
BG: been featured in a number of publications over the years, including
BG: Adam Magazine, Playboy, Partner, Variety, Celebrity Sleuth, Femme
BG: Fatales and the National Enquirer.
BG: 
BG: Angela died unexpectedly on November 27, 1988, of what was officially
BG: declared "heart disease". She was 32 years old. She is buried in
BG: Riverside Cemetery in Pierre, South Dakota, where she was born.
BG: 
BG: There were actresses who had better roles and who achieved more in their
BG: careers, but the fact that, despite her rather lightweight film roles,
BG: Angela's fans fondly remember her nearly twenty years after she left us
BG: speaks volumes about her cinematic legacy.

HT: 6' 0"

BG: Baseball's all-time home run king, Hank Aaron did more than hit home
BG: runs. Sure, Aaron led the National League (NL) four times, he also was
BG: a two-time batting champion and led the league in RBIs four times and
BG: runs scored three times. He won the NL's Most Valuable Player award in
BG: 1957 and has a lifetime batting average of .305. Aaron got his start
BG: playing for the Indianapolis Clowns, of the Negro Leagues before
BG: signing on with the Milwaukee Braves. He played at their minor league
BG: team in Eau Claire, Wis., one of the first black players there, and was
BG: brought up by the Braves in 1954. For the next 23 years, Aaron
BG: clobbered Major League pitchers. Never a charismatic player, Aaron
BG: often let his bat do the talking. He was the subject of intense media
BG: scrutiny in 1973-74 when he approached 'Babe Ruth' (qv)'s hallowed home
BG: run record. Aaron received more than 10,000 letters (most of them hate
BG: mail and even death threats) during the off-season claiming he should
BG: not break the record. Ever the ultimate professional and gentleman, he
BG: ignored the insults and slurs and went about the opening season in
BG: 1974. On April 8, 1974, Aaron hit his 715th home run, breaking Ruth's
BG: record and in doing so, received the undying support of the fans. He
BG: finished with 755 overall before retiring after the 1976 season. Aaron
BG: was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1982, and now works in the
BG: front office for the Atlanta Braves.

QU: * It took me 17 years to get 3000 hits in baseball. I did it in one
QU:   afternoon on the golf course.
QU: * You can only milk a cow so long, and then you're left holding the pail.
QU: * I have always felt that although someone may defeat me, and I strike out
QU:   in a ball game, the pitcher on the particular day was the best player.
QU:   But I know when I see him again, I'm going to be ready for his curve
QU:   ball. Failure is a part of success.
QU: * I never doubted my ability, but when you hear all your life you're
QU:   inferior, it makes you wonder if the other guys have something you've
QU:   never seen before. If they do, I'm still looking for it.
QU: * I don't feel right unless I have a sport to play or at least a way to
QU:   work up a sweat.
QU: * Guessing what the pitcher is going to throw is 80% of being a successful
QU:   hitter. The other 20% is just execution.
QU: * I don't want them to forget ['Babe Ruth' (qv)], I just want them to
QU:   remember me!
QU: * I looked for the same pitch my whole career, a breaking ball. All of the
QU:   time. I never worried about the fastball. They couldn't throw it past
QU:   me, none of them.
QU: * I'm hoping someday that some kid, black or white, will hit more home
QU:   runs than myself. Whoever it is, I'd be pulling for him.
QU: * In baseball, there is something electrifying about the big leagues. I
QU:   had read so much about ['Stan Musial' (qv)], ['Ted Williams (I)' (qv)],
QU:   ['Jackie Robinson (I)' (qv)]. I had put those guys on a pedestal. They
QU:   were something special. I really thought they put their pants on
QU:   different, rather than one leg at a time.
QU: * I never smile when I have a bat in my hands. That's when you've got to
QU:   be serious. When I get out on the field, nothing's a joke to me. I
QU:   don't feel like I should walk around with a smile on my face.
QU: * 'Roger Maris (I)' (qv) lost his hair the season he hit 61; I still have
QU:   all my hair, but when it's over, I'm going home to Mobile and fish for
QU:   a long time.
QU: * You got to play 150 games a year, so pick your spots. You can miss two
QU:   games a month; so pick the days you're gonna be hurt, or you're gonna
QU:   rest or you're gonna have a drink or two. The rest of the time, be on
QU:   that field.

NM: Aaron, Paul

DB: Hoosick Falls, New York, USA

BG: Paul Aaron has been creating successful productions since he began his
BG: professional career directing a national company of "The Prime Of Miss
BG: Jean Brodie", starring Oscar-winning actress 'Kim Hunter (I)' (qv). He
BG: made an impressive switch to films with the sensitive and critically
BG: acclaimed _A Different Story (1978)_ (qv), starring
BG: 'Meg Foster (I)' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv). This film, which now
BG: appears regularly in film revival houses and on cable television, has
BG: become a "cult classic".
BG: 
BG: Following graduation from Bennington College, Paul Aaron arrived in Los
BG: Angeles to become the Casting and New Programs Director for the
BG: 'Mark Taper' (qv) Forum. At the same time, he founded an actor's
BG: workshop and directed several plays, including a critically acclaimed
BG: production of "The Three Penny Opera". He was brought to New York to
BG: direct the successful, off-Broadway rock musical hit, "Salvation",
BG: featuring, among others, the then- unknowns 'Bette Midler' (qv),
BG: 'Barry Bostwick' (qv) and 'Joe Morton (I)' (qv). He next moved to
BG: Broadway to direct the comedy "Paris Is Out", starring
BG: 'Sam Levene (I)' (qv) and 'Molly Picon' (qv), becoming the youngest
BG: director in Broadway history.
BG: 
BG: After directing the first international company of "Salvation" in
BG: Amsterdam, he returned to New York to helm, among other plays, the Obie
BG: award-winning off-Broadway musical, "Love My Children", and, on
BG: Broadway, the 'John Kander' (qv) and 'Fred Ebb' (qv) musical, "70 Girls
BG: 70", the 'Howard Dietz' (qv) and 'Arthur Schwartz (I)' (qv) musical,
BG: "That's Entertainment", and the American premier of Italian playwright
BG: 'Ugo Betti' (qv)'s drama, "The Burnt Flowerbed". Variety called his
BG: direction of that play "...nothing less than masterful".
BG: 
BG: Soon after moving back to the West Coast, Aaron directed an immensely
BG: successful revival of 'Paddy Chayefsky' (qv)'s, "The Tenth Man",
BG: starring 'Richard Dreyfuss' (qv). He was awarded the Los Angeles Drama
BG: Critic's Award as best director of the year for this presentation.
BG: 
BG: His second feature film as a director, _A Force of One (1979)_ (qv), an
BG: action-thriller staring 'Chuck Norris' (qv) and
BG: 'Jennifer O'Neill (I)' (qv), with a screenplay by Academy Award-winner
BG: 'Ernest Tidyman' (qv), was a tremendous box office success.
BG: 
BG: Paul's next challenge was to direct 'William Gibson (I)' (qv)'s classic,
BG: _The Miracle Worker (1979) (TV)_ (qv), starring 'Patty Duke' (qv) and
BG: 'Melissa Gilbert (I)' (qv). This NBC Special Event not only garnered
BG: some of the network's highest ratings for the season, but also won Paul
BG: a number of distinguished awards, both here and abroad. These include a
BG: Director's Guild nomination, the Director's prize from the Monte Carlo
BG: Film Festival, a Golden Globe nomination and the Christopher Award.
BG: "The Miracle Worker" was nominated for four Emmys and won three,
BG: including one for 'Patty Duke' (qv) as "Lead Actress in a Dramatic
BG: Special" and, even more impressive, the Emmy as "Outstanding Dramatic
BG: Special" of the 1979-1980 season.
BG: 
BG: For his next project, he chose to direct the CBS movie,
BG: _Thin Ice (1981) (TV)_ (qv), starring 'Kate Jackson (I)' (qv) and the
BG: venerable film star, 'Lillian Gish' (qv).
BG: 
BG: He followed "Thin Ice" with a return to Broadway, directing
BG: 'Claudette Colbert' (qv) in "A Talent For Murder", an original
BG: suspense-comedy that turned out to be her last work on the stage.
BG: 
BG: Next on film was the CBS Special, _Maid in America (1982) (TV)_ (qv),
BG: starring 'Mildred Natwick' (qv), 'Susan Clark (I)' (qv) and
BG: 'Fritz Weaver' (qv). Aaron then directed the ABC film,
BG: _When She Says No (1984) (TV)_ (qv), which starred
BG: 'Kathleen Quinlan' (qv), 'Jane Alexander (I)' (qv) and 'Rip Torn' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Aaron's company, "Elsboy Entertainment", purchased and developed the
BG: 'Jack Finney (I)' (qv) novel, "Marion's Wall", and Aaron adapted it for
BG: the screen with 'Patricia Resnick' (qv), who wrote the screenplay. The
BG: movie, entitled _Maxie (1985)_ (qv), starring 'Glenn Close' (qv) and
BG: 'Mandy Patinkin' (qv) and directed by Aaron, was produced in
BG: association with "Elsboy Entertainment" and was released by Orion
BG: Pictures.
BG: 
BG: He then directed the award-winning NBC television special,
BG: _In Love and War (1987) (TV)_ (qv), the story of Adm.
BG: 'Jim Stockdale' (qv), which starred 'James Woods (I)' (qv) and
BG: 'Jane Alexander (I)' (qv). "In Love and War" garnered brilliant reviews
BG: and was chosen by The Hollywood Reporter as one of the top five shows
BG: televised during the season.
BG: 
BG: Aaron had also been concentrating on building a successful management
BG: and production company under the umbrella of "Elsboy Entertainment". In
BG: 1992, he sold the management division of his company to
BG: 'Erwin Stoff' (qv), who had worked with him for fifteen years. They met
BG: when Paul was a guest professor at the University of Washington in
BG: Seattle where Erwin was a grad student. Together, they developed the
BG: careers of several now-famous actors, writers and directors.
BG: 
BG: The reason Paul decided to leave the rigors of running a full-time
BG: management company was to concentrate on his writing and producing. The
BG: first project he sold was a three-hour mini-series for HBO, entitled
BG: _Laurel Avenue (1993) (TV)_ (qv), which he executive-produced,
BG: co-created and wrote with 'Michael Henry Brown' (qv). It aired in 1993
BG: and was called "a golden moment in the history of television", by
BG: Pulitzer prize-winning critic 'Tom Shales' (qv) of the Washington Post.
BG: 
BG: Paul returned to directing with a film, for the Lifetime Cable Network,
BG: entitled, _Untamed Love (1994) (TV)_ (qv). It is based on the book,
BG: "One Child", by 'Torey Hayden' (qv), and recounts the extraordinary
BG: true story of her work with special education students in the public
BG: schools.
BG: 
BG: Aaron's next project was a one-hour dramatic series for CBS entitled,
BG: _"Under One Roof" (1995)_ (qv), which he executive-produced with
BG: 'Michael Henry Brown' (qv) and 'Thomas Carter (II)' (qv), and which he
BG: co-created and co-wrote. It starred 'James Earl Jones' (qv) and
BG: 'Joe Morton (I)' (qv).
BG: 
BG: The summer of 1996 saw the premiere of _Grand Avenue (1996) (TV)_ (qv),
BG: a three-hour dramatic mini-series based on the book of the same title
BG: by 'Greg Sarris' (qv). Aaron and "Elsboy Entertainment"
BG: executive-produced the project with 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) and his
BG: company, Wildwood Enterprises, Inc. This saga of three Native American
BG: families in Santa Rosa, California, was the first major exploration of
BG: contemporary Indian life on American television. It won critical
BG: acclaim among both the Native American and mainstream audiences, and
BG: scored the highest rating of any HBO program of the season. Paul is
BG: continuing to develop "Calle Ocho" (Eighth Street), the next
BG: installment in his 'American family' series for HBO, which focuses on
BG: an extended Cuban-American family in Miami.
BG: 
BG: In addition, Paul recently did a rewrite for "Jerry Bruckheimer Films"
BG: and another for 'Robert DeNiro''s "Tribeca Films" with his former
BG: writing partner, 'Michael Henry Brown' (qv). They also wrote "Land of
BG: Opportunity" (2000), adapted from the book by 'William Adler (I)' (qv),
BG: and "Shadowman" (2000), based on the popular comic book, both for New
BG: Line Pictures. Their original screenplay _In Too Deep (1999)_ (qv) was
BG: made into a major motion picture by Miramax Films which Paul also
BG: produced. 'Roger Ebert' (qv), among many other critics, gave the film
BG: two very "big thumbs up".
BG: 
BG: In 2005, Paul produced his most recent feature,
BG: _Looking for Sunday (2006)_ (qv), starring 'Michael Weston (I)' (qv),
BG: 'Orlando Jones' (qv) and 'Katharine Towne' (qv), independently, with
BG: the hopes for release in 2006.
BG: 
BG: Currently, Paul is producing the independent film which Suntaur
BG: developed, _Skills Like This (2007)_ (qv).

DD: 1 August 1938, Mendocino, California, USA

HT: 7' 2 1/2"

BG: Like 'Charles Chaplin' (qv)'s sidekick, 'Eric Campbell (I)' (qv),
BG: 'Harold Lloyd (I)' (qv) needed his own giant when casting
BG: _Why Worry? (1923)_ (qv) in 1922. Lloyd first had his eyes on George
BG: Auger ('Cardiff Giant' (qv)) who worked at Ringling Brothers sideshow
BG: as a giant. But Auger died before the film started and a search went
BG: out for a replacement. The producer 'Hal Roach (I)' (qv) heard of a
BG: shoemaker that was constructing a pair of shoes for a "Norwegian living
BG: in Minnesota", and his name was John Aasen. His mother was Kristi
BG: Danielsen (b. 1868) from Numedal in Norway. She emigrated to the US via
BG: Liverpool during spring of 1887. It is not 100% certain who Aasen's
BG: father was, but while working in Eggedal, Norway, Kristi Danielsen met
BG: the Swedish Nils Jansson Bokke who reached a prominent 244 cm in
BG: height. It had to have been "The clash of the Titans" when the couple
BG: met as Aasen's mother had her own merit with the height of 220cm. But
BG: the passenger list on board D/S "Rollo" listed Kristi Danielsen as
BG: single. Later that year Aasen was born and we can only speculate if his
BG: father was the Swede. Some sources lists him as 273 cm tall and with a
BG: weight of 251 kilos. Nearly 8 meters of material was needed to make him
BG: a suit. In other words; impressive! The annual Nummedalslagets yearbook
BG: of 1925 wrote: "Apparently the world's tallest human (in the civilized
BG: world) with a loving and sympathetic personality who always appears
BG: courteous and modest. In 'Harold Lloyd (I)' (qv)'s film classic,
BG: _Why Worry? (1923)_ (qv) , Aasen plays "Colosso". He is suffering from
BG: a toothache and stuck in jail with other prisoners of a revolution in
BG: Chile. Lloyd is Harold von Palham as the rich hypochondriac who ends up
BG: in the same prison as "Colosso" and cures him of his toothache. Forever
BG: grateful "Colosso" aids van Palham in his adventures as escapees from
BG: the prison. With a cannon on his back and bullets hanging from his
BG: neck, the pair becomes an unusual couple who create comic mayhem. The
BG: film became one of the largest box-office attractions of 1923. Aasen
BG: was a great success in his first film and appeared in several others,
BG: but not with the same impact. It is said he mastered Norwegian fluently
BG: and for many years performed as a "Sideshow" attraction for C.A.
BG: Wortham Shows. He died on the 1st August 1938 in Mendocino, California.

BG: uncle owned the place, which Diego visited since when he was a child.
BG: He was first employed as a light technician, then he began to perform
BG: as the "terruncello", the guy who lives in the North of Italy but still
BG: retains his Southerner accent. He began his career as a comedian at the
BG: end of the 70es, but he really succeeded in the 80es with blockbuster
BG: Italian comedies. His first dramatic role was in 1985 with Pupi Avati's
BG: movie "Regalo di Natale", which acknowledged him as a truly gifted
BG: actor. In 1985 he met Gabriele Salvatores, who directed him in many
BG: important movies (e.g. the Academy Award winner Mediterraneo). His
BG: filmography witnesses his versatile acting. Recently he starred in the
BG: Italian Tv serial "Il giudice Mastrangelo", where he has the role of a
BG: judge from Milan who returns to his native Puglia to solve mysteries
BG: and crimes. His entire career seems to pay tribute to his Northern and
BG: Southern origins.

TR: * In 1975, "SOS" became the first song with a palindromic title recorded
TR:   by a group with a palindromic name - Abba - to score a Top 20 hit on
TR:   the pop charts.
TR: * Created the band's name ABBA by taking the first letter of the first
TR:   name of each band member and flanking the males' initials with the
TR:   females' initials.
TR: * Artists who have requested permission to use samples of ABBA songs
TR:   include: 'The Fugees' (qv) ("The Name of the Game" for "Rumble in the
TR:   Jungle"), 'Madonna' (qv) ("Gimme Gimme Gimme" for "Hung Up"), etc.
TR: * Their popular songs were mostly composed by 'Björn Ulvaeus' (qv)
TR:   (lyrics) and 'Benny Andersson (I)' (qv) (music).
TR: * Not only were ABBA the most successful Swedish band in pop history, they
TR:   were the most successful pop act to emerge from a Eurovision Song
TR:   Contest victory (1974).
TR: * At the Swedish premiere of _Mamma Mia! (2008)_ (qv), the foursome were
TR:   seen together, in public, for the first time in 22 years.
TR: * As of 2008, more than 30 million fans worldwide have seen the stage
TR:   production "Mamma Mia!" When adapted for the screen,
TR:   _Mamma Mia! (2008)_ (qv) went on to become the most successful movie in
TR:   the UK's box office history, outstripping the record heretofore held by
TR:   the Harry Potter series.
TR: * In addition to _Mamma Mia! (2008)_ (qv), an earlier film that also
TR:   features the music of ABBA is the highly acclaimed
TR:   _Muriel's Wedding (1994)_ (qv).
TR: * Before 1974, the members of the group resisted using the name ABBA,
TR:   which was what fans and disk jockeys were starting to call them. A
TR:   Swedish seafood company had trademarked the name in 1906. (As with the
TR:   singing group, the seafood company's name was an acronym. It stands for
TR:   "AB Bröderna Ameln" which translates to "Ameln Brothers, Ltd.") In
TR:   1974, the two ABBAs agreed to a deal where the singing group would pay
TR:   a licensing fee to the seafood company in exchange for the use of its
TR:   name.
TR: * All four members of the group were the first-born children in their
TR:   respective families. Anni-Frid Lyngstad was an only child. The other
TR:   three each had one sister and no brothers.
TR: * Have sold over 375 million records, making them the fourth best-selling
TR:   music artists in the history of music.
TR: * "Abba Gold" has sold over 28 million copies worldwide. It is Abba's most
TR:   successful album and one of the biggest-selling albums of all time. It
TR:   is the third biggest selling album of all-time in the UK with sales
TR:   exceeding 4.6 million copies.
TR: * "Abba Gold" has occupied every position in the top 75 of the U.K. album
TR:   chart, while also appearing in the chart every year since the release
TR:   except for 2002 and 2006. It now jointly holds the title of longest
TR:   time spent in the album charts (490 weeks in the Top 100) with
TR:   "Greatest Hits Vol 1" by Queen.
TR: * Their 1976 single "Fernando" has sold 10 million copies worldwide. In
TR:   Australia the single spent 14 weeks at number one and 40 weeks on the
TR:   singles chart. It topped the chart in 13 countries and sold over 6
TR:   million copies in 1976 alone.
TR: * Have never scored a top 10 album in the U.S. Their highest charting
TR:   album there is "ABBA: The Album" which made #14 in 1978.
TR: * "Dancing Queen" is their only US number single. They scored 9 other top
TR:   20 hit singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 between 1974 and 1980.
TR: * The band only ever toured 3 times in its history. This was mainly to do
TR:   with them wanting to be the headliner and not the opening act. In fact,
TR:   they had only played 23 live dates in total before their 1979 tour in
TR:   support of "Voulez Vous". That tour was the only time the band toured
TR:   North America and would also prove to be their last world tour.
TR: * Were once offered a billion dollars to do a reunion tour.
TR: * During one of their live shows in Perth in 1977, an anonymous phone call
TR:   informed that there was a bomb somewhere at the venue. Everyone except
TR:   Benny (playing the instrumental piece "Intermezzo No 1") was evacuated.
TR:   There was no bomb though and both the audience and the artists later
TR:   returned to the venue and continued the evening.

NK: Het
NK: Silverback

HT: 6' 3"

BG: Shane Abbess made his first film at the age of 14 on his parents Betamax
BG: camera and after completing High School, was immediately accepted as
BG: one of the youngest students ever at the North Sydney TAFE film course.
BG: 
BG: After a brief stint in Television, he returned to filmmaking where he
BG: would spend close to a decade working odd jobs and selling personal
BG: belongings to fund his short film projects.
BG: 
BG: During this time that Shane formed Redline Films with several of his
BG: peers and would go on to win many film festivals both home and abroad
BG: whilst gathering an extensive support network and fan base via the
BG: emerging internet and media outlets of the time.
BG: 
BG: Shane pushed hard and fast to evolve his skills and earned a reputation
BG: for his stylish visuals that complimented stories with heart and in
BG: early 2005, gathered his forces and put it all on the line to make the
BG: feature film 'Gabriel'. Release in cinemas in 2007 Gabriel has recently
BG: been purchased for international distribution by Screen Gems .
BG: 
BG: Shane is currently working as director on the new Universal Pictures
BG: sci-fi feature Source Code, which is due to be released late in 2009.

BY: RGM

TR: * Has worked with the same Sound Designer and Composer for almost a
TR:   decade.
TR: * Whilst making Gabriel, would often run out of money and had to work
TR:   daytime in a call center then go and sit in with the editor at nights.
TR: * Attended Lucas Heights Community School in New South Wales, Australia.
TR: * His favorite or Top 5 films are Fight Club, Saving Private Ryan, Field
TR:   of Dreams, The Notebook and Aliens.

OW: * Music video: Directed "Johnny Lee" video for Genevieve Maynard Trio.
OW: * Music video: Directed "Million Miles" for iOTA.
OW: * Music video: Directed "Go Slow Girl" for Stella One Eleven.
OW: * Music video: Directed "Friends" video for iOTA.
OW: * Music video: Directed "Heavy Tourniquet" video for Othermind.
OW: * (2005) Music video: Directed "Kingsmillrox" video for The Bleed.

QU: * I think one of the fundamental flaws in Australian cinema in the past
QU:   few years has been that we haven't been able to connect with an
QU:   audience, especially internationally. We shouldn't be making films to
QU:   satisfy funding criteria or industry peers, it should just be about the
QU:   audience and what they want, because at the end of the day, it's them,
QU:   which includes you and me, that's ultimately going to decided whether a
QU:   film fails or not. They're the boss. That's it. It sounds simple, I
QU:   know, but if you look at our box office figures in the past decade,
QU:   we're obviously missing the mark somewhere. I think there's a very
QU:   positive movement happening at the moment in the independent sector
QU:   which is starting to show the depth of filmmaking talent this country
QU:   has to offer and our want to tell stories that appeal to a wider
QU:   fan-base.
QU: * I don't think the larger Australian Community realizes how hard a film
QU:   like 'Gabriel' was to make or what it has actually done and/or said
QU:   about our local industry. In time though, the truth will surface
QU:   through more filmmakers grabbing the bull by the horns and starting
QU:   where Gabriel left off.

BG: production, editing, lighting, camera and sound, as well as directing
BG: documentaries and narratives. Abdul graduated from S.V.A at the top of
BG: his class with a Bachelor's degree in fine arts and a completed thesis
BG: film titled "99%". The film's content and style was unlike any other
BG: film in his graduating class. He was completely influenced by the
BG: images that he saw on the then new music channel, MTV. Its slick
BG: lighting, camera work, fashion and quick edits forever changed his way
BG: of thinking about filmmaking and storytelling. During the next few
BG: years, Abdul worked as a sound technician on several feature films
BG: including, _Def by Temptation (1990)_ (qv) , _City of Hope (1991)_ (qv)
BG: and 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv) and
BG: _Mo' Better Blues (1990)_ (qv). Eventually, he started working on music
BG: videos as the sound "playback" technician. Soon, Abdul put his skills
BG: as an editor to the test when he convinced a friend/director,
BG: 'Millicent Shelton' (qv) to let him edit a Kwame music video for her.
BG: That was the start of his second career. He started editing for other
BG: directors such as 'Paris Barclay' (qv), 'Darnell Martin' (qv),
BG: 'Lionel C. Martin' (qv) and 'Hype Williams' (qv). Abdul's big break
BG: came when 'Ann Carli' (qv) at Jive records gave him a chance to direct
BG: a video for a new Hip Hop group called "2 Too Many", a group formed and
BG: produced by 'Will Smith (I)' (qv). After completing the video, he began
BG: shopping his reel as a director/editor. Abdul soon landed his next
BG: video for a jazz track by the legendary singer/actress
BG: 'Abbey Lincoln' (qv). The video "People In Me", landed Abdul a Gold
BG: Award for "Best jazz video" in the 1993 Worldfest film festival. In
BG: 1994 he was commissioned to direct a video for a hip-hop trio called
BG: "Original Flavor". The track was called "All that". That is where he
BG: met the group's manager 'Damon Dash (I)' (qv) and his partner
BG: 'Jay-Z' (qv) of Roc-a-fella records. Abdul was soon hired to directed
BG: 'Jay-Z' (qv)'s first video, "I Can't Get Wit That", at a final budget
BG: of $5000. Then the 'Jay-Z' (qv) video "In My Lifetime" was soon to
BG: follow. That video was one of the first "Big Baller"-type videos that
BG: are now commonly seen, exploiting the images of wealth, champagne,
BG: diamonds, girls and bravado. In the next few years Abdul directed
BG: several other videos for 'Jay-Z' (qv) including the #1 videos for the
BG: songs "Ain't NoÉ" (featuring 'Foxy Brown (I)' (qv)) and "Dead
BG: Presidents" as well videos for other artists, including the Motown
BG: artists, Shades, The Whitehead Bros. and Ladae . Abdul also directed
BG: and edited a "live" concert video for Columbia Records artist
BG: 'Kenny Lattimore' (qv), which was featured on a BET special and
BG: featured on an ABC networks "live in concert" special. Over the years
BG: Abdul has also had his hand in role of Producer, producing
BG: 'Naughty By Nature (I)' (qv)'s first video "O.P.P" for
BG: 'Marcus Raboy' (qv) and music videos for C-Money directed by
BG: 'Jeff Byrd' (qv), Poor Righteous Teachers and co-producing several
BG: videos with his Producer 'Schavaria Reeves' (qv). In the late 90s Abdul
BG: collaborated with 'Damon Dash (I)' (qv), 'Jay-Z' (qv) and
BG: 'Cha-Ka Pilgrim' (qv) of Roc-a-fella Records to direct a series of
BG: "B-side" videos interwoven with narrative skits for 'Jay-Z' (qv)'s new
BG: album. The project was shot over an eight-day period with an extremely
BG: modest budget. The project was entitled
BG: _Streets Is Watching (1998) (V)_ (qv). It was released in 1998 and was
BG: huge hit amongst new and old fans, earning the #1 slot for several
BG: weeks in Billboard magazine's "long form music video category". The
BG: long- form-mini-movie sold well over 100,000 units, becoming a

NM: Abbott, Brooke (II)

RN: Brooke English Anne Abbott

NK: Brooklyn

DB: 17 July 1983, Los Angeles, California, USA

BG: Brooke Abbott is a filmmaker, philanthropist and mother with a passion
BG: for the arts, history, green living and community which she
BG: incorporates into all of her projects including charity, film and
BG: photography. Born and raised in Los Angeles, she is the middle of nine
BG: children with both parents living and working in the entertainment
BG: industry. As a child, Brooke's mother was very involved in local social
BG: causes and philanthropic work. She made sure the Brooke and her
BG: siblings understood the value of humanity and giving were standard
BG: practices in their household. Given her background it's easy to see how
BG: Brooke became enamored by the art of giving and of performance while
BG: watching her siblings and parents take projects from the seed of an
BG: idea to a dream come true for themselves and others.
BG: 
BG: After completing high school, Brooke decided to become a director of
BG: film & television. She graduated from The Academy of Art University in
BG: San Francisco where she completed several endearing short film projects
BG: that dealt with love, relationships and women working in the industry.
BG: 
BG: Upon graduation, Brooke moved back down to Los Angeles and worked
BG: through several internships at HBO Films, Yvette Lee Bowser and
BG: SisterLee Productions and finally took a job with
BG: Actor/Author/Philanthropist Holly Robinson Peete and husband Ex-NFL
BG: Star/Philanthropist/Author Rodney Peete for their non-profit
BG: organization, The HollyRod Foundation. Brooke's interest in non-profit
BG: funding and philanthropy grew as she worked with the Peete's to help
BG: families who had members living with Parkinson's Disease & Autism
BG: receive proper therapies, treatments and care for a better quality of
BG: life. Brooke continued her work with the Peete's and the HollyRod
BG: Foundation for a years along with continuing her passion for filmmaking
BG: by working on independent projects and network shows such as "Half &
BG: Half", "Desperate Housewives" & "The Bridget Show".
BG: 
BG: In 2008, Brooke found love with Steven Honeycutt and in late 2009 they
BG: welcomed their first son, Jaxon Lee Coltrane Honeycutt. While taking a
BG: sabbatical from work to focus on her family, Brooke came up with an
BG: idea to open a after school program housed in a sustainable building
BG: for the high school students of New Orleans, LA. From this idea, Brooke
BG: & Steven started work on building their own non-profit foundation, The
BG: HoneyBrooke Foundation that will not only fund their sustainable after
BG: school house program, but other programs & foundations that will work
BG: toward helping our youth receive a better education, learn how to live
BG: & support their community & live a better quality of life. The
BG: fundamentals instilled in Brooke at an early age aren't allowing her to
BG: quit any dreams, instead allowing her to embrace all talents and
BG: passions while contributing to humanity.

HT: 5' 8"

BG: Long acknowledged as one of the best "straight men" in the business, Bud
BG: Abbott worked in carnivals while still a child and dropped out of
BG: school in 1909. He worked as assistant treasurer for the Casino Theater
BG: in Brooklyn, then as treasurer and/or manager of various theaters
BG: around the country. He worked as the straight man to such vaudeville
BG: and burlesque comics as Harry Steepe and Harry Evanson while managing
BG: the National Theater in Detroit. In 1931 while cashiering at the
BG: Brooklyn theater, he substituted for comic 'Lou Costello (I)' (qv)'s
BG: ill straight-man. The two clicked almost immediately and formed their
BG: famous comedy team. Throughout the 1930s they worked burlesque,
BG: minstrel shows, vaudeville and movie houses. In 1938 they got national
BG: exposure through the 'Kate Smith (I)' (qv) radio show "The Kate Smith
BG: Hour", and signed with Universal Pictures the next year. They made
BG: their film debut in _One Night in the Tropics (1940)_ (qv), and, while
BG: the team wasn't the film's stars, it made money for Universal and they
BG: got good enough notices to convince Universal to give them their own
BG: picture. Their first starring film, _Buck Privates (1941)_ (qv), with
BG: 'The Andrews Sisters' (qv), grossed what was then a company-record $10
BG: million (on a $180,000 budget) and they were on their way to stardom
BG: and a long run as the most popular comedy team in America. In 1942 they
BG: topped a poll of Hollywood stars. They had their own radio show (ABC,
BG: 1941-6, NBC, 1946-9) and TV show
BG: (_"The Abbott and Costello Show" (1952)_ (qv)). After the war their
BG: careers stalled and the box-office takes for their films started
BG: slipping. However, they made a big comeback in
BG: _Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)_ (qv), which raked in
BG: huge profits and even got the team good notices from critics who
BG: normally wouldn't even review their films. The movie's success
BG: convinced Universal to embark on a series of films in which the team
BG: met various monsters or found themselves in exotic locations. Their
BG: film career eventually petered out and the team split up in 1957.
BG: Costello embarked on a series of TV appearances and even made a film,
BG: without Abbott, called _The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock (1959)_ (qv),
BG: but it was a flop. He received good notices after a dramatic
BG: performance in an episode of _"Wagon Train" (1957)_ (qv) and was in
BG: discussion to star in a biography of famed New York City mayor
BG: 'Fiorello LaGuardia' (qv), a project Costello had been trying to get
BG: off the ground for years, when he died. Both Abbott and Costello had
BG: major tax problems with the Internal Revenue Service and wound up
BG: virtually broke. Abbott started over with a new partner,
BG: 'Candy Candido' (qv), in the 1960s and set off on a national tour,
BG: including Las Vegas, but the act failed. In 1966 he voiced his
BG: character in a cartoon version of their television show. His health
BG: deteriorated badly in the late 1960s, he had always suffered from
BG: epilepsy, and he died in 1974.

BG: and moved to Moscow. There he studied nuclear physics at the famous
BG: 'FisTech' where the Nobel Prize Laureats Landau, Tamm, and Semyonov
BG: were among professors.
BG: 
BG: At that time Abdrashitov became involved in amateur film-making. Then he
BG: transfered to the Mendeleev Institute of Technology, because it was
BG: equipped with the film studio for students. His cultural and artistic
BG: interests developed during the "Thaw", that was initiated by

BG: comedy based on the screenplay by 'Grigori Gorin' (qv). In 1975
BG: Abdrashitov met with the unknown writer 'Aleksandr Mindadze' (qv). That

BG: films, which they made together in 30 years. Their films were awarded

BG: they go through mystical experiences in the battlefield, then in a
BG: "city of women", in a retirement home, and finally they witness a
BG: Parade of the Planets, a rare cosmic event that happens once in a
BG: thousand years.

BG: 'Sergey Garmash' (qv) and 'Chulpan Khamatova' (qv), received several
BG: awards and nominations. Their latest _Magnitnye buri (2003)_ (qv)
BG: (aka.. Magnetic Storms) is an apocalyptic, anti-Utopian, almost
BG: "pavlovian" analysis of provincial life in Russia, where people are
BG: programmed to become zombies, trapped in a vicious cycle of work for
BG: survival and the only events that bring variety to their monotonous
BG: life are occasional sparks of bloody fist-fights - albeit powerless to
BG: change the general doom.
BG: 
BG: Vadim Abdrashitov is a Member of the Russian Film Academy and a Member
BG: of the Russian Union of Cinematographers. He received numerous awards
BG: and nominations at Russian and International film festivals and was

QU:   in no hurry to impress me with his knowledge or his power. He called me
QU:   Lewis, and that decision endeared him to me even more. It was at once
QU:   formal, my full name. II was no baby Lewie. Lewis. I liked that.
QU: * On Coach John Wooden: He broke basketball down to it's basic elements.
QU:   He always told us basketball was a simple game, but his ability to make
QU:   the game simple was part of his genius. There was no ranting and
QU:   raving, no histrionics or theatrics. To lead the way Coach Wooden led
QU:   takes a tremendous amount of faith. He was almost mystical in his
QU:   approach, yet that approach only strengthened our confidence. Coach
QU:   Wooden enjoyed winning, but he did not put winning above everything. He
QU:   was more concerned that we became successful as human beings, that we
QU:   earned our degrees, that we learned to make the right choices as adults
QU:   and as parents. In essence, he was preparing us for life.

NM: Abdullah, Achmed

RN: Alexander Nicholayevitch Romanoff

DB: 12 May 1881, Yalta, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire [now Crimea, Ukraine]

DD: 12 May 1945, New York City, New York, USA

BG: Alexander Nicholayevitch Romanoff (Achmed Abdullah) was the author of
BG: numerous adventure and mystery stories, usually set in strange and
BG: exotic locations.
BG: 
BG: Alexander's father, Grand Duke Nicholas Romanoff, was a cousin of Tsar
BG: Nicholas II of Russia and his mother, Princess Nourmahal Durani, was
BG: the daughter the Amir of Afghanistan. Alexander, along with his brother
BG: Yar and sister Gothia, were born at the Romanoff Palace in Yalta, the
BG: future site of the historic Second World War conference in Yalta
BG: between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. After pressure from the Afghan
BG: and Russian royal houses forced their parents to divorce, Alexander,
BG: along with his sister went to live with their uncle in Afghanistan,
BG: Yar, the oldest, stayed with his father in Russia. Alexander was
BG: adopted by his uncle, who changed his name to Achmed Abdullah Nadir
BG: Khan el-Durani el Iddrissyeh and raised him in the Muslim faith. Yar,
BG: who later became an officer in the Russian Army, was killed in 1914
BG: during the Battle of Tannenberg. Gothia was said to have married an
BG: Indian rajah. In 1936, after years of being torn between the Russian
BG: Orthodox Church he was baptized in, and the Muslim faith he was raised
BG: in, Abdullah became a Roman Catholic.
BG: 
BG: Abdullah went to schools in Afghanistan, India, France, and finally
BG: England, where he attended Eton and Oxford. Upon graduation he became a
BG: British citizen and joined the British Army, where he served with merit
BG: at postings in China, Tibet, Russia, Eastern Europe, France, India and
BG: Africa. Because of his ability to blend in with several different
BG: cultures, he was often called upon by British Intelligence to work as a
BG: spy. Not long after Abdullah retired from the British Army with the
BG: rank of captain, he joined the Turkish Army and fought with distinction
BG: in the First Balkan War (1912-1913). By the time Abdullah decided to
BG: pursue a writing career his life experiences had gained him a plethora
BG: of material to draw upon for decades to come.
BG: 
BG: Abdullah began writing in earnest after coming to the United State
BG: sometime after 1914. Soon stories like "The Blue Eyed Manchu", The Red
BG: Stain", "The Soul Catcher" and "Bucking the Tiger" were appearing in
BG: newspapers and magazines across the country. By the early 1920's he was
BG: writing for both the stage and the screen. In 1928 he published a
BG: collection ballads and poems from Central Asia entitled "Lute and
BG: Scimitar". His autobiography, "The Cat Had Nine Lives" (1933), reads
BG: like one of his romantic adventure stories. In 1937, he wrote with John
BG: Kenney, a cookbook entitled, "For Men Only". Abdullah's first Broadway
BG: play, "The Honourable Mr. Wong" (1932), adapted from his story, "The
BG: Hatchetman", was written with the help of 'David Belasco (I)' (qv)
BG: around the time he became a permanent resident of the United States.
BG: Though many of his stories and plays were very popular with the public,
BG: he will probably always be best remembered for the classic movies,
BG: _The Thief of Bagdad (1924)_ (qv) and
BG: _The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: Achmed Abdullah must have been quite an imposing figure when seen out in
BG: public, with his military posture, impeccable suite, hat tilted just
BG: so, gray spats and monocled eye. In 1945 Abdullah passed away on his
BG: birthday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York after an
BG: illness of several months. He was survived by his third wife, Rosemary
BG: Dutton, whom he married in 1940, a year after his second wife of twenty
BG: years, literary agent Jean Wick, had passed away. His first wife, Irene
BG: Augusta Bainbridge, was still married to him when he filled out his
BG: Word War One draft registration card in 1918.

DB: 29 May 1953, Tobolsk, Russian SFSR, USSR [now Russia]

DD: 3 January 2008, Moscow, Russia (cancer)

HT: 6' 2"

BG: Aleksandr Abdulov, one of Russian cinema's best known sex symbols who
BG: refused to serve the Communist Party and suffered a blow to his career,
BG: was one of the most celebrated Russian film stars.
BG: 
BG: He was born Aleksandr Gavrilovich Abdulov on May 29, 1953, in Tobolsk,
BG: Siberian Russia, into the family of a theatre director from Fergana,
BG: Uzbekistan. His father, named Gavriil Abdulov was a wounded veteran of
BG: the Second World War decorated for his courage at the front-line tank
BG: battles against the Nazis. Abdulov's mother was a make-up artist at
BG: several Russian theatres. Young Abdulov grew up in Uzbekistan, where he
BG: finished high school and also became the Master of Sports in fencing.
BG: He was admitted to a local college where he had the chance of becoming
BG: a sports coach.
BG: 
BG: His dream of becoming an actor was almost ruined when he failed the
BG: admission tests at the Moscow State Institute of Theatrical Arts
BG: (GITIS). He could not go back to Uzbekistan so he stayed in various
BG: gloomy dorms in Moscow, working hard labor jobs at railway stations
BG: just to survive. He then studied acting at GITIS, made very little
BG: money working as an extra, and still was a hard laborer in order to pay
BG: for his living in Moscow. In 1975 he graduated from GITIS and was hired
BG: by the Lenkom Theatre director 'Mark Zakharov' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Abdulov revealed the full range of his talent in popular films
BG: _Obyknovennoye chudo (1978) (TV)_ (qv) and
BG: _S lyubimymi ne rasstavaytes (1979)_ (qv). The public adored Abdulov
BG: and he became the first big sex-symbol amidst the gloom of Soviet
BG: mass-zombification. Millions of his pictures has been decorating homes
BG: and student dorms in every big and small town of the former Soviet
BG: Union. His popularity made the Communist Party demand his performances
BG: at the Party Congresses, offering him such lines as "We are entering
BG: communism", but he refused to serve the Communist Party. Abdulov boldly
BG: turned down such offers twice. Then he suffered for several years from
BG: invisible interference with his work hurting his income, and his way of
BG: life. But the public still loved Abdulov - the actor and the man - for
BG: his sincere talent and for his devotion to his ideas.
BG: 
BG: Despite the political pressure threatening his film career during the
BG: 1970s and early 1980s, Aleksandr Abdulov made a strong comeback and
BG: gained even more popularity. He played his best roles under the
BG: direction of 'Mark Zakharov' (qv) in such films as 'Obyknovennoe Chudo
BG: (1978), 'Tot samyi Munchgausen (1979), 'Formula Lyubvi' (1984), and
BG: _Ubit drakona (1988)_ (qv). His best film partners were
BG: 'Oleg Yankovskiy' (qv), 'Evgeni Leonov' (qv),
BG: 'Vyacheslav Tikhonov' (qv), 'Evgeni Evstigneev' (qv),
BG: 'Leonid Bronevoy' (qv), 'Andrey Mironov' (qv), 'Irina Kupchenko' (qv),
BG: 'Leonid Yarmolnik' (qv), 'Semyon Farada' (qv), 'Aleksandr Zbruev' (qv),
BG: 'Sergey Nikonenko' (qv), 'Irina Alfyorova' (qv) and others. This
BG: ensemble of fine actors and directors evolved into a special and
BG: uniquely Russian milieu, where Abdulov's multifaceted talent was
BG: supported by other actors.
BG: 
BG: His range and nuanced acting reached a new level in the films made in
BG: the late 1980s and 1990s. Abdulov created powerful roles in a tandem
BG: with the masterful 'Innokenti Smoktunovsky' (qv) in the innovative film
BG: 'Geniy' (1991) by director 'Viktor Sergeyev' (qv). At that time,
BG: Abdulov also received a Nika Award nomination for supporting role in
BG: _Sukiny deti (1990)_ (qv) by director 'Leonid Filatov (I)' (qv).
BG: Abdulov made two equally interesting works in collaboration with
BG: director 'Sergei Solovyov' (qv) in 'Chyornaya roza - emblema pechali,
BG: krasnaya roza - emblema lyubvi' (1989) and in 'Dom pod zvyozdnym nebom'
BG: (1991). Both works were awarded, acclaimed by critics, and loved by the
BG: public.
BG: 
BG: Abdulov showed his gift for transformation in the devilish character
BG: Korov'ev in 'Master i Margarita' (2005), a TV-series from director
BG: 'Vladimir Bortko' (qv) based on the eponymous book by
BG: 'Mikhail A. Bulgakov' (qv). Abdulov's energy helped the film making him
BG: the most lively nerve in the group of 'super stars' (some say super old
BG: stars). His acting became more classic and restrained in the
BG: traditionally Russian period-film 'Anna Karenina' (2005) based on the
BG: eponymous novel by 'Leo Tolstoy' (qv) from director
BG: 'Sergei Solovyov' (qv). Later Abdulov worked with director
BG: 'Aleksandr Buravsky' (qv) in the epic film _Leningrad (2009)_ (qv),
BG: about the historic siege during the Second World War; where his acting
BG: partners were 'Gabriel Byrne' (qv), 'Mira Sorvino' (qv),
BG: 'Kirill Lavrov' (qv), 'Mikhail Efremov' (qv), 'Donatas Banionis' (qv)
BG: and other notable actors.
BG: 
BG: Aleksandr Abdulov was designated People's Artist of Russia. He received
BG: numerous awards and nominations for his performances in film and on
BG: stage. He was a permanent member of the troupe at Lenkom Theatre in
BG: Moscow. He also directed several films as well as stage productions.
BG: Aleksandr Abdulov died of lung cancer, on January 3, 2008, and was laid
BG: to rest in Vagankovskoe cemetery in Moscow, Russia.

DD: 28 December 2006, Tokyo, Japan (natural causes)

BG: Komei Abe was born on 1 September 1911 in Hiroshima. He studied the
BG: cello with Heinrich Werkmeister (1883 - 1936) at the Tokyo Music School
BG: (today's Music Department of Tokyo University of Fine Arts and Music),
BG: at the time the best facilities in Japan for studying Western music.
BG: Abe formed a chamber ensemble and worked on Beethoven's music in
BG: particular.
BG: 
BG: Abe played in the Music School's orchestra under conductor/composer
BG: Klaus Pringsheim who he admired. Pringsheim, appointed professor at the
BG: Tokyo Music School in 1931, had been a pupil of 'Gustav Mahler' (qv)
BG: and had conducted operas in Geneva, Prague and Bremen in the 1910s, and
BG: a cycle of Mahler's symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic. Abe began
BG: to study German-style harmony and counterpoint with him, and decided he
BG: wanted to become a composer, not a cellist. Abe was strongly influenced
BG: by this teacher's view and knowledge of the late romanticism period
BG: represented by Mahler and 'Richard Strauss (I)' (qv), and
BG: neo-classicism by 'Paul Hindemith' (qv) and 'Kurt Weill' (qv).
BG: 
BG: At the age of 34 Abe had already written some works including several
BG: orchestral pieces, four string quartets, one flute sonata, choral
BG: pieces and film music, and had established his name as a master
BG: neo-classicist. In 1948 he was appointed music director of the imperial
BG: orchestra, a position he held for six years. The ensemble performed
BG: waltzes and serenades for guests from foreign countries at parties held
BG: by the Emperor. The members of the imperial orchestra however were
BG: originally musicians of Gagaku, performing Japanese ancient music. From
BG: them Abe learned Japanese traditional music, with which he was not very
BG: familiar in his younger days. It broadened the horizons of his
BG: compositional style.
BG: 
BG: Abe's works in the postwar days include Symphony No. 2 (1960), Clarinet
BG: Quintet (1946) and String Quartets Nos. 5-15 (1947-1993). He died at
BG: the age of 95 in Tokyo, in the morning of 28 December 2006.

BG: to be spared dishonor and allowed to pass the third time, under the
BG: agreement that he would never practice medicine, because he wanted to
BG: be a writer. In the 1960s he adapted his novels

BG: _Suna no onna (1964)_ (qv), and _Tanin no kao (1966)_ (qv) to film. The
BG: last proved unsuccessful, and the professional relationship they had
BG: dissolved. Abe's works did not shy away from the surreal or even
BG: elements of science fiction, and frequently dealt with medical doctors
BG: and medical terminology, even when becoming extremely Kafkaesque. His
BG: last book, Kangaroo Notebook, was published posthumously and
BG: maddeningly questions Abe's favorite themes: illusion vs. reality.

NM: Abel, Robert (I)

DB: 10 March 1937, Cleveland, Ohio, USA

DD: 23 September 2001, Los Angeles, California, USA (heart attack)

BG: One of the genuine visionaries of Digital Computer Graphics and Visual
BG: Effects. From the early 1970s through the mid-80s, the Hollywood-based
BG: studio Robert Abel & Associates (RA&A) pushed the leading -- sometimes
BG: bleeding -- edge of visual effects. Working primarily in television
BG: advertising, (the only consistent market for such work at the time)
BG: RA&A created 33 Clio Award-winning commercials, including the dazzling
BG: 7Up "Uncola" spots and the influential CG "Sexy Robot." This body of
BG: work, as noted by New York's Museum of Modern Art, "changed television
BG: forever." Abel was primed for this path since his undergraduate studies
BG: at UCLA, where his mentor was the "father" of computer graphics,
BG: 'John Whitney Sr.' (qv). Working with an analog computer strapped to a
BG: camera, Abel happened accidentally upon a look that evolved into the
BG: 'slit scan' effect used in _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv). His
BG: friend 'Con Pederson' (qv), who pursued the technique in that film's
BG: famous 'stargate' sequence, would eventually become Abel's first
BG: partner. By the time the pair set up shop in 1971, Abel had become an
BG: Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker, with credits as varied as
BG: _Making of the President 1968 (1969) (TV)_ (qv) and
BG: _Mad Dogs & Englishmen (1971)_ (qv). The first visual effects job which
BG: the fledgling studio produced was the now-famous Whirlpool "streak"
BG: logo, which opened the door to assignments in TV graphics, commercials
BG: and films. Abel and Pederson were joined early on by
BG: 'Richard Taylor (III)' (qv), and the list of accomplished effects
BG: experts who worked at RA&A would grow over the years to include --
BG: among many -- 'Richard Edlund' (qv), 'Richard E. Hollander' (qv),
BG: 'Robert Legato' (qv), 'Mark Stetson' (qv) and 'John Hughes (XI)' (qv).

BG: A familiar character face in movies and television, Walter Abel was a
BG: dedicated stage actor who had studied at the prestigious American
BG: Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York before moving on to a progression
BG: of stage work that culminated in his first appearance on Broadway in
BG: the original play "Forbidden" in late 1919. The year before he had just
BG: dabbled in the relatively new film industry doing
BG: _Out of a Clear Sky (1918)_ (qv) directed by prolific silent actor and
BG: director 'Marshall Neilan' (qv). Abel did just one other silent and
BG: then moved back into serious stage work for ten years (including doing
BG: some road productions in 1924) before once again surfacing in film for
BG: the first sound version of the play _Liliom (1930)_ (qv). Perhaps he
BG: was enticed with doing the play on film, but his was a small part and
BG: the sound of early talkies - as usual - was lousy. Once again Abel
BG: returned to Broadway and worked steadily from late 1930 into part of
BG: the 1934 season. He would have some 40 Broadway roles in his career.
BG: 
BG: About that time his stage success was noticed by Hollywood, and he was
BG: signed with RKO. The studio had decided to do the first sound version
BG: of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers (1935) which first appeared as
BG: a silent in 1922 with 'Douglas Fairbanks' (qv). The part of the
BG: enthusiastic but novice D'Artagnan really called for a younger actor
BG: reflecting those traits, and RKO decided to go with Abel. He had a
BG: bright voice and an animated style of theater acting that seemed a good
BG: bet. It was all the more impressive considering Abel was in his mid 30s
BG: - but he looked younger. RKO did not skimp on the film. The director
BG: was Rowland Lee, who had just finished another Dumas filming, The Count
BG: of Monte Cristo (1934) with 'Robert Donat' (qv). The rousing music was
BG: composed by Max Steiner, and the costumes were gloriously rendered by
BG: Walter Plunkett.
BG: 
BG: Abel had a strong supporting cast in the three musketeers:
BG: 'Paul Lukas' (qv), 'Moroni Olsen' (qv), and 'Onslow Stevens' (qv).
BG: Imposing European leading man Lukas and LA native Stevens had
BG: transitioned from silent films. This was Olsen's first movie, but he
BG: was a stage actor with his own acting troupe and some Broadway
BG: experience. As Porthos he had the opportunity to boom and bellow with
BG: hammy 19th century theatrics that fit the part. Abel's competence and
BG: an experienced cast showed in an enthusiastic rendition of the story
BG: with dueling set ups by first-time fencing choreographer
BG: 'Ralph Faulkner' (qv) that would be taken to heart by later
BG: productions. So those who have tended to hindsight this film as a pale
BG: forerunner of later versions really do it a contextual injustice.
BG: 
BG: The movie did well enough, and Abel moved among second tier RKO leads
BG: through 1938, while playing support to bigger names. But that is
BG: showbiz - obviously he was destined as a supporting actor, and he
BG: handled both comedy and drama with a self-assured style that kept him
BG: very busy through the 1940s. He was back on Broadway occasionally as
BG: well, with a last appearance in 1975. By 1949 he quickly embraced early
BG: TV playhouse productions and would appear in some 30 roles by 1960. He
BG: transitioned to being a familiar face on episodic TV along with a few
BG: more film roles through the 1960s and up to just a few years before his
BG: passing.

NM: Abell, Tim

RN: Timothy Shawn Abell

DB: 1 July 1958, Manassas, Virginia, USA

HT: 5' 10"

BG: An exciting, eclectic actor, Tim Abell is a man of his own making and
BG: when that making includes teaching ballroom dancing, horse training,
BG: writing, cooking, acting, producing and being a US Army Ranger with the
BG: 75th Ranger Regiment, you can see it is a formidable combination.
BG: 
BG: From the Maryland and Virginia area, as a young man Tim took up martial
BG: arts and boxing. He found a respect for wildlife conservation and a
BG: love for the land while hunting and fishing with his elders. At the age
BG: of 17 he joined the army, and owing to outstanding leadership skills,
BG: was promoted during basic training. He advanced quickly, attending AIT,
BG: Airborne School and Ranger School, all at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was
BG: assigned to the 2nd Ranger Battalion, Ft. Lewis, Washington, as a
BG: Ranger after enduring the Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP).
BG: 
BG: Gaining further promotions, Tim also achieved a substantial number of
BG: awards due to his expertise in many varied fields. During his final
BG: year in the Army he served with the 3rd US Infantry, "The Old Guard",
BG: Caisson Platoon. Here he excelled as a horseman and played
BG: 'Robert E. Lee (II)' (qv) and 'Andrew Jackson (XI)' (qv), charging into
BG: battle on his trusty steed, in the US Army dramatic re-enactment of the
BG: History of the United States Torch Light Tattoo, at the Jefferson
BG: Memorial in Washington, DC, and a longer version called "The Spirit of
BG: America" performed in various places.
BG: 
BG: After five years of service Tim left the army to go to college. Once
BG: there he was encouraged to join the 'Arthur Murray (I)' (qv) Dance
BG: Studio and was soon teaching class to support himself through college.
BG: It was here that Tim first got involved with the theatre. Just short of
BG: graduating he took the decision to leave college and head to Los
BG: Angeles, where he took classes with 'Jeff Corey (I)' (qv) while
BG: searching for that all-important break.
BG: 
BG: Early on, after a series of low-budget films and many theatre projects,
BG: his break came, when 'April Webster' (qv) recommended that
BG: 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv) cast him in
BG: _Soldier of Fortune (1997) (TV)_ (qv) as Benny Ray Riddle, a former
BG: Marine scout/sniper recruited by the Pentagon to work as part of a
BG: covert team. The syndicated series ran for two seasons. Then followed a
BG: series of films that made much of Tim's military experiences, including
BG: _The Base (1999) (V)_ (qv), where he starred opposite
BG: 'Mark Dacascos' (qv) in a performance that had him compared to a young
BG: 'Willem Dafoe' (qv), and
BG: _The Substitute: Failure Is Not an Option (2001) (V)_ (qv) which also
BG: starred 'Treat Williams' (qv) and 'Bill Nunn' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Tim was to find himself starring with Dacascos again in the film
BG: adaptation of 'Lisa Gardner (I)' (qv)'s book "The Perfect Husband". In
BG: _Instinct to Kill (2001)_ (qv) Tim played psychotic killer Jim Beckett
BG: with 'Melissa Lahlitah Crider' (qv) as his long-suffering wife.
BG: 
BG: _Murder, She Wrote: The Last Free Man (2001) (TV)_ (qv) for CBS, saw a
BG: change of direction for Tim into historical costume drama, which was
BG: then followed by roles alongside 'James Caan (I)' (qv) and
BG: 'Daniel Stern (I)' (qv) in 'Jason Bloom' (qv)'s award-winning "Dead
BG: Simple" a.k.a _Viva Las Nowhere (2001)_ (qv), and in the much acclaimed
BG: _We Were Soldiers (2002)_ (qv) starring 'Mel Gibson (I)' (qv).
BG: Guest-starring roles in the television series'
BG: _"CSI: Miami" (2002)_ (qv),
BG: _"NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service" (2003)_ (qv) and
BG: _"JAG" (1995)_ (qv) bought Tim face to face with
BG: 'David Caruso (I)' (qv), 'Mark Harmon (I)' (qv) and
BG: 'David James Elliott' (qv).
BG: 
BG: In recent projects Tim has been behind the camera as well as in front of
BG: it. He was co-producer on the multi-award-winning film
BG: _Soldier of God (2005)_ (qv), directed by 'David Hogan (II)' (qv) and
BG: produced by 'Mir Bahmanyar' (qv). To date, "Soldier of God" has won
BG: Best Feature Film awards for 2005 at The Deep Ellum Film Festival in
BG: Dallas, The Stratford upon Avon International Film Festival in England
BG: and The Berkley Film Festival in California. As well as being
BG: co-producer on "Soldier of God", Tim took on the emotional intensity of
BG: portraying the eponymous anti-hero, Rene. It was a tour de force for
BG: this talented actor.
BG: 
BG: Tim also starred in and was associate producer on the
BG: 'Thadd Turner' (qv)-written _Miracle at Sage Creek (2005)_ (qv)
BG: starring 'David Carradine' (qv), 'Wes Studi' (qv),
BG: 'Michael Parks (I)' (qv) and 'Irene Bedard' (qv). Further films with

BG: Soul Train eye candy favorite for the young men of her time. Her
BG: popularity gained her entry into popular black oriented magazines like
BG: Right On! where she modeled clothes and gave various interviews by
BG: popular demand. No other ladies were more lovelier and sweeter then

NM: Abernathy, Don

BG: Don Abernathy - The Integrated Filmmaker
BG: 
BG: What is an Integrated Filmmaker?
BG: 
BG: I, Don Abernathy, believe that today's filmmaker must be trained,
BG: educated, and experienced in a variety of disciplines that are
BG: associated with the film-making process and constantly explore, expand
BG: and stay tuned in to the never ending evolution of the high tech
BG: digital and Internet world we now live in.
BG: 
BG: The speed at which change happens as a result of this fast-paced digital
BG: and Internet world affects every aspect of what goes on in film-making
BG: and the motion picture industry for both Independent and Industry
BG: Standard filmmakers.
BG: 
BG: The old notion of being a "Director" the way it was conceived and
BG: practiced in the early days and or "Golden Days" of Hollywood no longer
BG: applies.
BG: 
BG: Today's filmmaker, especially Independent Filmmakers must be
BG: "Integrated" into the reality of this fast-paced digital and Internet
BG: world. That means being pro-active in understanding, educating, and
BG: staying involved in the stream of rapid changes that are constantly
BG: on-going, as well as become familiar, adaptable, or at least
BG: appreciative to the related skills involved in the film-making process,
BG: including Grip, Production Management and / or Line Producing, Camera
BG: Operations, Cinematography, Editing, Marketing and Promotions.
BG: 
BG: Integrated is the new Independent / Dependent Filmmaker by my
BG: definition. Integrated is not necessarily a Master of all things
BG: film-making, but is rather a Master at connecting the dots of how each
BG: of these related skills flow into making the work process necessary to
BG: work and be applicable to the modern digital and Internet world.
BG: 
BG: With in the Primary Goal of becoming a completely "Integrated"
BG: filmmaker, Don Abernathy has chosen to tackle a series of training,
BG: education, and practical experience in order to further appreciate and
BG: understand what it is to be a modern day Independent Filmmaker.
BG: 
BG: Among dozens of student films, feature films for Video/DVD and
BG: television release, Don Abernathy had the honor of working a Post
BG: Production position on James Cameron's "Avatar", 2009,) via IMAX, and
BG: recently as a Grip second Unit)on the feature film "Silver Case", 2011,
BG: staring Eric Roberts, Seymour Cassel, and Shalim Ortiz.
BG: 
BG: Over the last decade, Abernathy has worked in over 100 feature films,
BG: commercials, music videos, and television shows as either an Actor,
BG: Writer, Director, Assistant Director, Camera Operator, Producer,
BG: Associate Producer, Production Crew, Grip, Production Manager, and even
BG: Background Artist, all in the spirit of learning and growing; becoming
BG: a true Integrated Independent Filmmaker.

BG: - Back 2 'Da Hood." She was also the leading lady in the award winning
BG: HBO film "Don King, Only In America," NBC's award nominated "The
BG: Tempest" opposite Peter Fonda, in HBO's award winning "Miss Evers Boys"

BG: 
BG: She was born in the midst of the American Civil Rights Movement to
BG: Juanita and Reverend Doctor Ralph David Abernathy, who created with his
BG: best friend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. a movement which changed the
BG: course of American History. Her life began with the bombing of her
BG: parent's home, to attending all of the major Civil Rights Marches, to
BG: integrating the elementary school system in the South. Because the
BG: Abernathy home was the preferred meeting place for Dr. King, Dr.
BG: Abernathy and their staff, Donzaleigh had a myopic view into the
BG: integral decision making process that helped to shape American Laws and
BG: society by the creation of the Civil Rights Bill, the Public
BG: Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act.
BG: 
BG: To honor of her parents, Ms. Abernathy authored the history book,
BG: "Partners To History, Martin Luther King, Ralph David Abernathy and the

BG: table pictorial of American History which is sold out was nominated as
BG: one of the "Best Books of 2004" for Young Adults by the American

HT: 5' 1"

BG: Frankie Jo Abernathy was born in Blue Springs, Missouri, on December 21,
BG: 1981. She has lived there her entire life, and returned to live with
BG: her parents, Abbie Hunter and stepfather, Perry Hunter, and 13-year-old
BG: sister, Mamie.
BG: 
BG: Frankie's claim to fame is being the "outcast" on MTV's 14th season of
BG: _"The Real World" (1992)_ (qv), shot in San Diego. While viewers
BG: perceived Frankie as an angry, depressed, self-mutilating person,
BG: Frankie is actually a very happy person, when she's on her own terms.
BG: 
BG: The main problem with Frankie's stint on the
BG: _"The Real World" (1992)_ (qv) is that Frankie, who suffered from
BG: Cystic Fibrosis, has a very short life span expectation, and she felt
BG: that the experience was dragging her down and, in a sense, wasting her
BG: time, which is very precious for someone who will probably only live to
BG: 30, tops.
BG: 
BG: She left on Halloween of 2003, returning to Blue Springs where she dated
BG: her boyfriend, tattoo artist, Dave Duly. She enjoyed body mods, hanging
BG: out with friends and family, going to shows, and trying to live each
BG: day to the fullest.

BG: Frankie died June 9, 2007, in Shorewood, Wisconsin, from complications
BG: due to her disease, Cystic Fibrosis, at the age of 26.

NM: Abhijeet (I)

RN: Abhijeet Bhattacharya

DB: Kanpur, India

BG: Abhijeet was born as Abhijeet Bhattacharya, in a middle-class Bengali
BG: family from Kanpur (UP). His parents were against his singing but
BG: Abhijeet went against his parent's wishes to become a singer. In Kanpur
BG: his family members were all musical, and educated professionals. Money
BG: was never a contextual concern. In Kanpur education and culture was all
BG: his family courted, leisure was driving around the tree-lined lanes on
BG: bicycles. Confident and feted for his success, today the star-singer
BG: lives in a Bollywood dream bungalow (named Sunny vistas) of white
BG: façade and red-tiled roof.
BG: 
BG: He was the apple of the community eye for his singing talents and
BG: Pampered and cosseted by a fond family, Abhijeet was the youngest of
BG: four brothers. He came to Mumbai in 1981 to study Chartered
BG: Accountancy. But owing to his fascination for singing and music he
BG: decided to pursue a career in playback singing. Despite being gifted
BG: with a melodious voice, he had to struggle for a very long time.
BG: 
BG: During his struggle period due to economic constraints Abhijeet had to
BG: reside in tiny rooms and stingy guesthouses. He returned to Kanpur but
BG: each time was drawn to the magnetism of Mumbai with a dream to be
BG: fulfilled. He was packing his bags after a long struggle in Bombay when
BG: he received a call from R.D. Burman to sing for Dev Anands son's debut
BG: film. Abhijeet also got to sing with Kishore Kumar, his idol, in the
BG: same film. It all happened to Abhijeet as he received a new lease of
BG: life when music director Ravindra Jain, gave him an offer to live with
BG: him. It was during his stay with Ravindra that Abhijeet's proximity to
BG: Bollywood grew in a phased and gradual manner. He began visiting R.D.
BG: Burman's residence and started getting frequent opportunities to sing
BG: for stage shows. Abhijeet got opportunities to sing as a chorus singer
BG: for music directors Rajesh Roshan and Jagjit Singh.
BG: 
BG: It was R.D. Burman who acted like a mentor to Abhijeet and gave him his
BG: first break as a playback singer in Dev Anand's Anand Aur Anand. The
BG: song was 'Waadon ki shaam aayi, yaaron ke naam aayi'. But the film
BG: flopped and he was struggling to find work again. For quite a few years
BG: after that he resorted to singing cover versions of Kishore Kumar hits.
BG: 
BG: In the 1990s he got his due rewards when the songs of Baaghi of
BG: Anand-Milind, 'Ek chanchal shokh hasina', 'Chandni raat hai' and 'Har
BG: kasam se badi hai' were Superhits. Today Abhijeet is one of the top
BG: names when it comes to male playback singers. He has entrenched himself
BG: firmly in the music world, with several other hits like 'Ole Ole' in
BG: Yeh Dillagi, the title track of Main Khiladi Tu Anari, 'Zara sa Jhoom
BG: loo main' Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge 'Teri ankhen jhuki jhuki'
BG: Fareb, 'Shaher Ki ladki' Rakshak, 'Jhanjhriya' Krishna, 'Tan tana tan
BG: tan tara' Judwaa. Be it a Sunil Shetty, Anil Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Saif
BG: Ali Khan, or Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan and now Hrithik Roshan,
BG: Abhijeet has sung for them all. He performed for many films like
BG: Baaghi, Sadak, Khiladi, Raja Babu, Yeh Dillagi, Yes Boss, Baadshah,
BG: Josh and Dhadkan and many more. After his success in playback singing
BG: he thought of singing pop. He launched two albums, Main Deewana Hoon
BG: and Tapori No. 1. But both albums did not click commercially. After
BG: these two pop albums, he launched Aashiqui, which was appreciated by
BG: audience. Recently he has launched a pop album, Tere Bina, whose songs
BG: and video are chartbusters.
BG: 
BG: He won the Filmfare Award and Screen Award for the best singer for his
BG: song 'Main Koi Aisa Geet Gaoon' in Yes Boss. He also won the MTV ASIA
BG: Award 2004. After that singing with most of the big banner movies and
BG: top music composers, the singer has once again hit the top charts.

BG: original cast member and one of the most popular stars of the series,
BG: though Abigail quickly tired of the monotonous storylines for Bev (she
BG: was a shy virgin and the scriptwriters conspired to simply throw her
BG: into bed with a series of men) and after several public disagreements
BG: with the show's producers left suddenly in June 1973. The role of Bev
BG: was hastily recast, with the new actress taking over mid-episode.
BG: Abigail was the only major star of the series not to appear in the
BG: movie version released in 1974. Abigail had difficulty gaining many
BG: serious roles after leaving the series, and appeared in several
BG: bit-parts closely following the contours of her sex-symbol image in
BG: various sex-comedy films of the mid 1970s. Later appeared in several
BG: comedy roles on the stage, played a prim French teacher in school based
BG: drama _"Class of '74" (1974)_ (qv) and a super-efficient secretary in
BG: the early episodes of hospital soap _"The Young Doctors" (1976)_ (qv).
BG: Was finally lured back to Number 96 in 1976 briefly playing a new
BG: character called Eve who was to appear in a proposed spin-off series
BG: with 'Elaine Lee (I)' (qv) though the new series was never picked-up.
BG: Retired from acting and lived on a banana plantation in Queensland.
BG: Publicly criticized the increasingly overt sex-scenes and violence
BG: featured in the later episodes of Number 96. In 1984 after a long
BG: absence from the limelight was cast as comic heroine Caroline Morrell
BG: in television soap _"Sons and Daughters" (1982)_ (qv) by producers
BG: desperate to revamp the show after the departure of the series most
BG: famous character Patricia "Pat the Rat" Hamilton portrayed by
BG: 'Rowena Wallace' (qv). Abigail's character was a great success and the
BG: show survived a further three years with Caroline quickly becoming one
BG: of the central characters. She continued with the series until its
BG: demise in 1987. Later appeared in guest roles on TV shows such as the
BG: long-running series _"Neighbours" (1985)_ (qv), and was added to the
BG: cast of floundering series _"Chances" (1991)_ (qv) in a last ditch
BG: attempt to spice up its quickly fading popularity. In return to her
BG: sex-comedy roots, Abigail's Chances character was a sex-therapist named
BG: Bambi Chute.

BG: Khaled is a heart-throb star actor of the new generation of "Young
BG: Egyptian Cinema". Before his American debut in 2006's Civic Duty (2006)
BG: in which he gave an outstanding & compelling performance & very
BG: convincing portrayal of a very difficult character of Gabe Hassan, he
BG: made numerous films in his native Egypt. Here is how it all began ...
BG: 
BG: Since his first major public appearance as a TV late night show host in
BG: 1999, It was only a matter of few roles and He became an Award winning
BG: star in Egypt and the Arab world, His background is as versatile as it
BG: can get, No wonder he's been nicknamed Superman!
BG: 
BG: He studied Tele-communication Engineering and graduated with honours
BG: from Ain Shams University, one of the most prestigous Engineering
BG: schools in Egypt, meanwhile Water polo as his hobby grew fast to become
BG: almost a profession when he teamed up with Egypt's Water polo National
BG: team as its Goal Keeper, But it was his other passion of acting &
BG: singing at the Theatre Department of The American University in Cairo
BG: that grew with him gradually to become his chosen final career.
BG: 
BG: Exchange of hobbies and professions happened several times to Khaled.
BG: First when Water polo became the main focus for him 1986-1989, then
BG: Spacecrafts! and Tele-Communications while researching it at The
BG: University of Surrey, UK in 1991, while playing Water polo for his
BG: varsity team in European tournaments where He started a parallel career
BG: of Fashion Catwalk Modeling back then.
BG: 
BG: In 1999 another switch happened when he (as a famous young face & well
BG: established catwalk model in Egypt) was offered by chance! to Host a TV
BG: program at Nile Varity Channel as a part of a new TV pan-Arab Network
BG: inaugurated by state owned ERTU in Egypt. He became the talk of the
BG: town with his new fresh style and controversial ways. He hosted and
BG: interviewed all kinds of stars - Arab and international. Khaled left
BG: Nile Variety channel October 2000, joined MBC TV Network in June 2001.
BG: 
BG: In the year 2000 He was chosen by News Dept. (Ch: 1 in Egypt TV) as a
BG: result of winning the title of "Best New Announcer"; to present, "Good
BG: Morning Egypt", one of the most widely known programs in Egypt, and
BG: continued presenting it till end of 2001: The time for a major switch:
BG: he finally got his first acting break with offers of lead roles in
BG: movies in Egypt that started being released in Egypt and The Arab
BG: world.
BG: 
BG: In just a few years he collected more than 8 Best Actor Awards from
BG: National and International Film festivals & events. The latest is
BG: winning the Best Actor Award from Alexandria International Film
BG: festival 2006 for his role Essam in Leabet el hob (2006)
BG:

BG: liposuction, contouring as well as skin rejuvenation procedures and
BG: programs. A firm believer in taking advantage of the most advanced
BG: technologies and proven surgical advances, Dr. Aboolian skillfully
BG: utilizes the latest innovations. Men and women come from all over the
BG: country and the world to become patients of Dr. Aboolian. In addition
BG: to traditional plastic surgeries such as rhinoplasty (nose jobs) and
BG: breast augmentation, the doctor's expertise in body lift, arm lift,
BG: buttock lift and thigh lift procedures has led to him being referred to
BG: as the "body expert" by colleagues. These procedures are used to
BG: tighten loose skin and lift the specific body parts that sag with
BG: normal aging or significant weight loss.
BG: 
BG: Dr. Aboolian has been called upon to make regular appearances on ABC's
BG: "Extreme Makeover" and has been featured on such shows as "Access
BG: Hollywood," "iVillage Live," and others. His surgical skills and expert
BG: judgment are also sought after by a large international clientele,
BG: including celebrities and business executives. However, it is his
BG: sensitivity and natural connection with people that truly set him
BG: apart; he has the capacity to translate a person's desires into
BG: customized treatment, therefore facilitating a transformation of the
BG: mind as well as the body.
BG: 
BG: One of the doctor's most noted successes is Erik Chopin, who went from
BG: 400 lbs. to 193 lbs. to become "The Biggest Loser" on the NBC show of
BG: the same name. After meeting with numerous surgeons in the New York
BG: area where he lives, Erik chose to come to Los Angeles for a full body
BG: lift because he was so impressed with Dr. Aboolian and the results of
BG: similar surgeries he has performed. Dr. Aboolian not only has an
BG: abundance of impressive before and after photographs (he recommends
BG: that prospective patients see many not just one or two), he is also
BG: adamant about proper preparation for weight reduction surgeries. He
BG: requires that patients reach their optimum weight and train with an
BG: appropriate fitness trainer so they are in the best possible physical
BG: condition and learn to maintain a positive lifestyle. He will only
BG: operate on patients who achieve these goals so that the surgery will be
BG: a one time solution, not a band aid.
BG: 
BG: Dr. Aboolian completed his undergraduate education at the University of
BG: California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he received the Los Angeles
BG: Medical Center Auxiliary Award in 1989. The previous year he received
BG: the American Heart Association of Southern California Research Award.
BG: For medical school and General Surgery residency he attended the Mount
BG: Sinai School of Medicine in New York. His Plastic and Reconstructive
BG: Surgery residency was completed at the renowned MD Anderson Cancer
BG: Center at The University of Texas.
BG: 
BG: Dr. Aboolian is an Associate Fellow of the American College of Surgeons
BG: and is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS),
BG: California Society of Plastic Surgeons (CSPS), Los Angeles Society of
BG: Plastic Surgeons (LASPS) and California Medical Association (LASPS) and

NK: Zack

DB: 15 September 1983, Brooklyn, New York, USA

HT: 6' 2"

BG: Zack Abramowitz was born Zachary Scott Abramowitz in Brooklyn, New York
BG: in 1983. As a teenager he attended James Madison High School and
BG: started acting in school productions. Attending CUNY Hunter in
BG: Manhattan to study Theater, he trained under Bill Walters, Mira Felner
BG: and Barbara Bosch, performing in plays such as The Pillowman. During
BG: his time at Hunter he also became a consummate student and performer of
BG: improvisation at Chicago City Limits and the Upright Citizens Brigade.
BG: Even more significant in 2003 was his introduction to the Caymichael
BG: Patten Studio. There, under the tutelage and strong leadership of
BG: Caymichael Patten, Elyse Knight, and Heather Loschiavo he became an
BG: avid student, honing his craft and gaining experience in all facets of
BG: acting, both artistically and on the business end as well.
BG: 
BG: From this Zack branched off into independent productions both in the
BG: theater and on film. Whether it's abstract theater (4.48 Psychosis),
BG: improv comedy (The Art of the Pick-up), surrealism (Harold Maxx) or
BG: science fiction (Amazing Fantasy), he has attempted various styles of
BG: drama and comedy on both stage and screen. In 2005 he went as part of a
BG: traveling theater group with CUNY to China and performed A Dream Play
BG: for the Beijing Academy of Drama in front of an audience of a thousand
BG: people to much acclaim. After graduating in 2005, Zack continued with
BG: film and theater work such as Guardians, a blistering attack on
BG: torture, in which he plays one of two leads performing monologues, to
BG: the film comedy How to Lose in the Game of Life. To date, he has
BG: performed in several prestigious NYC theaters such as Primary Stages,
BG: Manhattan Theatre Source, Dramatist's Guild, the Flea, the Magnet,
BG: Upright Citizen's Brigade, and the Danny Kaye Playhouse. He has trained
BG: with various Casting Directors in NYC such as Paul Schnee of
BG: Barden/Schnee Casting, Alaine Alldaffer of Playwrights Horizons, Marci
BG: Phillips of ABC and Katja Blichfeld of NBC.
BG: 
BG: In 2007 Zack made his web-series debut with Zack and Michael. Not only
BG: did he create and star in this show, but he was also writer, director,
BG: and producer. Previously he had written and directed a short film while
BG: at CUNY, but for this his ambitions were rewarded. 13 episodes
BG: chronicle the "saga" of two aspiring actors, Zack and Michael of the
BG: title, and try to break into the industry by way of a reality show
BG: filming their every crazy move. The pilot episode, a Star Wars fan film
BG: parody, screened at both the Pilot Lite and Big Apple Con Film
BG: Festivals in 2008, and the videos have garnered tens of thousands of
BG: views on YouTube since.
BG: 
BG: Recently Zack has also directed, produced and starred in a short
BG: documentary on The Dark Knight, a tribute with interviews of fans on
BG: Halloween night in 2008 on the streets of New York, co-starred in
BG: another comedic web-series coming soon titled Losers (which he also
BG: writes for), and can soon be seen in the upcoming feature films The
BG: Bastard Men of Root Flats, a steampunk western, and the dark comedy The
BG: Mel Klein Diaries. Zack looks forward to continually working with
BG: inspired people on inspired projects.

BG: Abiola Abrams knew that she wanted to make movies after a 5th grade
BG: class trip to the Museum of TV & Radio. The product of mostly single
BG: sex education at The Brearley School in Manhattan, Abiola's first foray
BG: into media was as a member of a feminist rap and slam poetry group when
BG: she was 15. The group named Females Beyond Control drew praise from
BG: other young people in her community but extreme criticism from her
BG: headmistress. The powers that be at Sarah Lawrence College were more
BG: encouraging however and Abiola quickly found herself writing and
BG: directing theatrical projects. Her first successful project as a
BG: professional media-maker was as producer-writer of Off-Off-Broadway hit
BG: Goddess City when she was only in her early 20s.
BG: 
BG: Spurred into action after 9-11-01, Abiola became a full time director.
BG: In 2004, she and her family lost 2 of her mother's sisters unexpectedly
BG: to cancer within a 6 month period. This led her to realize that she
BG: could no longer wait to launch the empowerment movement that she
BG: envisioned for women and The Goddess Factory was born. Appropriately,
BG: her talent has not only been recognized by Ms. Magazine, but by Cosmo
BG: as well. Currently Abiola is curating the Until The Violence Stops Film
BG: Festival for theater activist Eve Ensler and directing a feminist hip
BG: hop film produced by Candida Royalle.

NK: The Mummy

DB: 13 November 1961, Hollywood, California, USA

HT: 5' 6"

BG: Alan Abrams was born to Dr. and Mrs. Steven Abrams in Hollywood,
BG: California. He grew up in nearby Brentwood, where he attended Brentwood
BG: Elementary, famous for having scenes from several movies, such as The
BG: Next Best Thing (starring Rupert Everett and Madonna). Abrams attended
BG: Paul Revere Junior High for a semester and then transferred to Theodore
BG: Herzl Jewish Academy, where he attended for grades 7 through 9. He then
BG: attended Fairfax High School and got his GED in 1979, shortly after the
BG: start of his senior year. In 1985, while in Texas on vacation, Alan met
BG: Sheana Cosper, a pretty, divorced, single mother. They got married
BG: later that year. In 1992, Zachary Michael and Dylan Anthony were born.
BG: The Abrams family moved to Colorado in 1994, after the earthquake.
BG: Shortly before, in June, Sheana and Alan found out that they were
BG: pregnant with their third child, Tyler Jacob, who was born in February
BG: 1995, exactly one month before the due date. In 1996, the Abrams family
BG: moved to Coral Springs, Florida and then moved again in October 2002 to
BG: Phoenix, Arizona.
BG: 
BG: Eleven years later, in mid-2006, Alan was playing golf with a former
BG: baseball player friend of his, Ferguson Jenkins, who, after Alan
BG: explained a bunch of strange rules on how he plays golf, told Alan he
BG: should make it into a TV series. A couple days later, after telling
BG: Sheana and making her laugh harder than she had in a long time, Alan
BG: called his friend Steve Scarsone, another former ballplayer, who agreed
BG: to be his production partner. A week later or so, Alan and Steve, along
BG: with Alan's son Zac, and an editor/cinematographer named Webb
BG: Pickersgill, met at a restaurant and discussed "The Weekenders Golf
BG: Tour", a new concept in reality game-show programming. Abrams, with the
BG: help of his son, Zac, created a web page and a MySpace profile, which
BG: each received a combined number of 70,000 hits within three days. The
BG: pilot was shot on September 11, 2006 and aired locally in Phoenix on
BG: January 7, 2007.
BG: 
BG: Alan and Sheana currently reside in Phoenix, Arizona, where they live

TR: * J.J. Abrams has been involved with several projects that avail
TR:   themselves of the social theory called the "Milgram Small World
TR:   Phenomenon," after the social psychologist Stanley Milgram, who
TR:   conducted acquaintance path experiments. John Guare's play
TR:   _Six Degrees of Separation (1993)_ (qv) (and its subsequent film
TR:   adaptation) is heavily responsible for introducing to the pop culture
TR:   at large the notion that everyone in the world is separated by only six

TR:   Abrams went on to produce _"Six Degrees" (2006)_ (qv), a TV show with a

TR: * Best friend is Greg Grunberg. They've known each other since they were
TR:   children and he frequently casts Grunberg in his films and TV shows.
TR: * Lives in Pacific Palisades, California.
TR: * In 2011, during an interview on the NPR program "Fresh Air with Terry
TR:   Gross," writer/director J. J. Abrams told a story about getting to
TR:   attend a very early rough-cut screening of
TR:   _Escape from New York (1981)_ (qv) with his father, Gerald W. Abrams, a
TR:   movie producer (who knew that his then-15-year-old son was a big John
TR:   Carpenter fan). Abrams told Gross that during the discussion afterward,
TR:   Gerald suggested cutting an opening sequence in which Snake tries to
TR:   rob a bank and is caught (on the principle that Snake seems like a more
TR:   imposing, mythic, tougher character if you don't see him defeated right
TR:   away), and young J. J. suggested making it clearer that Adrienne
TR:   Barbeau's character Maggie dies at the end. Both suggestions were
TR:   followed in the final cut: the opening scene was deleted, and a shot
TR:   was added showing Maggie's body.

QU: * Star Wars is probably the most influential film of my generation. It's
QU:   the personification of good and evil and the way it opened up the world
QU:   to space adventure, the way westerns had to our parents' generations,
QU:   left an indelible imprint. So, in a way, everything that any of us does
QU:   is somehow directly or indirectly affected by the experience of seeing
QU:   those first three films.
QU: * I feel like in telling stories, there are the things the audience thinks
QU:   are important, and then there are the things that are actually
QU:   important.
QU: * Directing's the best part. Whenever I've directed something, there's
QU:   this feeling of demand and focus that I like. And secondly, it means
QU:   that you've gotten through all the writing stuff, and the producing
QU:   stuff, and casting, and prep, and all those stages that are seemingly
QU:   endless. So directing is sort of the reward for all the work you put in
QU:   before. And then there's the editing, which is another amazing stage of
QU:   the process. It's incredible the moments you can create.
QU: * I'm an impatient guy and tend not to like to stay with one thing for a
QU:   long time. I'll never be able to write as many scripts as I did for
QU:   'Felicity' or 'Alias' ever again. I'm just too impatient these days. I
QU:   want to get on to the next project.
QU: * I've always liked working on stories that combine people who are
QU:   relatable with something insane. The most exciting thing for me is
QU:   crossing that bridge between something we know is real and something
QU:   that is extraordinary. The thing for me has always been how you cross
QU:   that bridge..
QU: * There's something about looking at Super 8 films that is so evocative.
QU:   You could argue it's the resolution of the film somehow because they

NM: Abrams, Jared

BG: He found himself studying forestry at Colorado State University when a
BG: forest ranger came in and said that there was little or no chance of
BG: getting into the forest service. He left College after five years of
BG: study. He had wanted to be a smoke jumper. Ten bucks an hour was good
BG: money, still is. Nothing can match the thrill of jumping at low levels
BG: into thick ponderosa pine and scorched earth!
BG: 
BG: Oh well, so he left Colorado for home. New York City and started at
BG: Lancit Media working on "Reading Rainbow" as a camera pa. He then
BG: realized that everything revolved around the camera. It was a good
BG: place to learn. He got a job working for Arriflex and learned all about
BG: the cameras, after three years as a camera tech. AVID's were coming of
BG: age. He had been doing some assistant editing work and wanted to learn
BG: more. He left camera and became an AVID editor.
BG: 
BG: Being stuck in an editing room for twenty two hours a day finally got to
BG: him and he left and went back to Camera Service Center. He started to
BG: get lots of work as a film loader and was able to work on many great
BG: projects such as the "Sopranos", HBO's "Real SEX" and movies like The
BG: 1996 Olympic Film "Endurance", Music Videos Fat Boy Slim "Weapon of
BG: Choice", "The Yards"," Planet of The Apes", and most recently "The
BG: Mothman Prophecies". Working with directors like James Grey, Tim
BG: Burton, Spike Lee, Mark Pellington, and Spike Jones really helped him.
BG: 
BG: It was on a small film that he finally was able to direct. During the
BG: production of the film "O" starring Julia Stiles and Rain Phoenix, he
BG: wrote and directed a short film on the beaches of South Carolina. They
BG: were shooting nights and the girls had agreed to do a short about
BG: childbirth. They all met at the beach and shot the film in less than an
BG: hour.

DB: 14 November 1906, Simferopol, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire [now Crimea, Ukraine]

DD: 21 October 1973, Moscow, USSR [now Russia]

BG: Andrei Abrikosov was a Russian film and stage actor best known for his
BG: leading and supporting roles in the Soviet films of the 1930s - 1950s,
BG: such as the silent film _Tikhiy Don (1931)_ (qv) and the Sergei
BG: Eisenstein's _Aleksandr Nevskiy (1938)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: He was born Andrei Lvovich Abrikosov on November 14, 1906, in
BG: Simferopol, Crimean province, Russian Empire (now Simferopol, Crimea,
BG: Ukraine). His father, Lew Abrikosov, was an agricultural technician,
BG: and his mother was a homemaker. Young Abrikosov left his parents' home
BG: as a teenager, and wandered all over Russia for several years, until he
BG: finally came to Moscow in 1925, at the age of 18. His first job was a
BG: metal worker at a Moscow industry, albeit he had a dream to become an
BG: actor, as he was fascinated by the silent movies.
BG: 
BG: In the summer of 1925 Abrikosov entered the acting studio of
BG: 'Aleksandra Khokhlova' (qv), but soon moved to the acting class of Z.S.
BG: Sokolova, the sister of 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv). In 1926
BG: Abrikosov joined the troupe of the Maly Theatre, but directors did not
BG: give him any roles to play for the next five years. However, in 1930 he
BG: was cast by directors 'Olga Preobrazhenskaya' (qv) and
BG: 'Ivan Pravov' (qv) as the main lead in the silent movie _Tikhiy Don
BG: (1931)_ (aka.. The Cossacks of the Don, or 'And Quiet Flows the Don')
BG: which was the first film adaptation of the eponymous novel by
BG: 'Mikhail Sholokhov' (qv). The film became popular in Russia and
BG: internationally, and Abrikosov became and instant celebrity.
BG: 
BG: Andrei Abrikosov co-starred opposite 'Nikolai Cherkasov' (qv) in the
BG: classic film _Aleksandr Nevskiy (1938)_ (qv) by director
BG: 'Sergei M. Eisenstein' (qv), and played supporting roles in both parts
BG: of 'Ivan the Terrible'. He was awarded the State Stalin's Prize (1941)
BG: and was designated People's Actor of Russia (1952) and People's Actor
BG: of the USSR (1968). During the 1930s he was a member of the troupe with
BG: the Moscow Chamber Theatre under directorship of
BG: 'Alexander Tairov' (qv). From 1938 to 1973 Abrikosov was a permanent
BG: member of the troupe at the Vakhtangov Theatre, and from 1953-1959 he
BG: was artistic director of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow.
BG: 
BG: During the peak of their acting career, in the 1950s and 1960s, Andrei
BG: Abrikosov performed together with his son, 'Grigori Abrikosov' (qv).
BG: They enjoyed much success, which brought the attendant pressure, and
BG: both developed addiction to alcohol. Both father and son Abrikosovs
BG: were notorious in Moscow for their frequent stage appearances after and
BG: between their routine drinks, and acting under the influence. However,
BG: their performances were usually so good that both were able to get away
BG: with alcohol abuse at work. Some performances by the father and son
BG: Abrikosovs under the influence were described in famous jokes about
BG: their ability to improvise on stage when they were drunk and completely
BG: forgot their lines, so they borrowed random phrases from several other
BG: plays and were able to get away with it brilliantly, often leaving the
BG: public amazed with their improvisations.
BG: 
BG: Andrei Abrikosov died on October 21, 1973, and was laid to rest in
BG: Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, Russia.

BG: _Svadba v Malinovke (1967)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: He was born Grigori Lvovich Abrikosov on August 30, 1932, in Moscow,
BG: Russia, USSR. His father, Lev Abrikosov, was a notable Russian actor.
BG: Young Grigori Abrikosov was brought up in the artistic environment of
BG: his father's circle; he was so impressed with the personality of his
BG: father, that no other influences could change his choice to follow his
BG: father's steps. From 1949 - 1954 he studied acting at the Shchukin
BG: Theatrical School of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow, where his father
BG: was artistic director. In 1954, he graduated as an actor, and joined
BG: his father on stage and in film.
BG: 
BG: From 1954 - 1993 Grigori Abrikosov was a permanent member of the troupe
BG: at Vakhtangov Theatre. There he played leading and supporting roles in
BG: stage productions of such classic plays as 'Talanty i poklonniki'
BG: (aka.. Talents and admirers) by 'Aleksandr Ostrovsky', a production
BG: that was later made into a film adaptation by director Isidor Annensky

BG: musical comedy by director 'Andrei Tutyshkin' (qv).
BG: 
BG: During the peak of their acting career, in the 1950s and 1960s,

BG: 
BG: After the death of his famous father, Grigori Abrikosov fell into
BG: depression and became an alcoholic. Although he was largely ignored by
BG: the new generation of filmmakers, he continued working with the
BG: Vakhtangov Theatre, and his stage acting remained strong, albeit he
BG: played only one role, appearing as doctor in a popular comedy 'Be

BG: separated when she was young. She attended school at St. Mary's
BG: Seminary in Springfield, New Jersey. Her acting career began in
BG: vaudeville and stock-company drama before she moved in front of the
BG: cameras.
BG: 
BG: In 1919, she came to California and negotiated a
BG: two-hundred-dollar-a-week contract with a movie studio based on the
BG: strength of her relationship with her lover, the famed star
BG: 'Alla Nazimova' (qv). Within a few months, she started another
BG: relationship with a younger, less established actress
BG: 'Grace Darmond' (qv). In the midst of this love triangle, she met the
BG: struggling actor 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv) at a party, and they became
BG: friends. After a two-month courtship, he asked her to marry him and she
BG: accepted. On November 6, 1919, they married, and on their wedding
BG: night, she locked him out. She wept claiming she made a mistake and
BG: later departed to 'Grace Darmond' (qv)'s apartment. Valentino tried to
BG: reconcile with her, but to no avail, and the marriage ended in divorce
BG: two years later when Valentino was a major star, while Acker's career
BG: was waning.
BG: 
BG: Newspapers had a field day when Valentino was charged with bigamy as he
BG: hadn't waited long enough to marry his second wife, the talented set
BG: and costume designer, 'Natacha Rambova' (qv). Acker sued for the legal
BG: right to call herself "Mrs. Rudolph Valentino," and Valentino remained
BG: angry at her for several years. However, they rekindled their
BG: friendship a few months before his death in 1926. She was one of the
BG: last people who saw him alive, and she attended his funeral with her
BG: mother. Soon after he died, she wrote and published a popular song
BG: about him, "We Will Meet at the End of the Trail."
BG: 
BG: She played bit parts in films, usually uncredited, until the early
BG: 1950s. She and her companion Chloe Carter owned a Beverly Hills
BG: building where actress 'Patricia Neal' (qv) lived for several years.
BG: She died in 1978 at the age of eighty-five. She and her companion
BG: Carter are now buried side by side in Holy Cross Cemetery, Los Angeles,
BG: California.

SP: * 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv) (5 November 1919 - 4 March 1923) (divorced)

TR: * She was at one time the lover of 'Alla Nazimova' (qv) and
TR:   'Grace Darmond' (qv).
TR: * She was part Cherokee.
TR: * She enjoyed collecting fashion templates.
TR: * In 1923, she toured in vaudeville with a sketch called "How She Won the
TR:   Sheik," exploiting her connection to 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv) even
TR:   though they were divorced.
TR: * She visited 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv) on his death bed and brought him a
TR:   ruffled white linen bedspread that she had embroidered herself, and a
TR:   pillow cover with "Rudy" embroidered in each corner.
TR: * Many years after 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv)'s death, Jean confided to her
TR:   friend, actress 'Patricia Neal' (qv), that the reason she left
TR:   Valentino on their wedding night was because he had confessed to her
TR:   that he had gonorrhea.
TR: * She was an expert horsewoman who once portrayed a jockey on-screen.
TR: * She was said to be engaged to a marquis from Madrid, Spain in 1923.
TR: * Her marriage to Rudolph Valentino lasted less than six hours.

QU: * [in 1913] I'd rather jump from a moving train or ride a motorcycle fifty
QU:   miles an hour or take a ride in an aeroplane than eat.
QU: * [asked why she married 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv)] It was simply a case of
QU:   California, the glamor of the Southern California moonlight and the
QU:   fascinating lovemaking of the man.
QU: * [on why she believed 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv) married her] I honestly
QU:   believe that Rudolph would have married then any woman with an
QU:   automobile.
QU: * [on her second encounter with 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv) at a party] The
QU:   first question he asked was, "Do you care to dance?" I decided to sit
QU:   it out with him under a California moon.

DB: 2 April 1935, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

BG: Although she was presented in 1969 the first Film Star of Tomorrow by

BG: a star never materialized. Not that she was inactive, quite the

BG: undistinguished movie films. She will, nevertheless, remain remembered
BG: for her role as 'Lee Marvin (I)' (qv)'s ex-wife in
BG: 'John Boorman' (qv)'s classic film noir _Point Blank (1967)_ (qv). The
BG: victim of Marvin's rough manners, Acker/Lynne left a deep impact on

BG: career in England when the play she was in, "Lucky Jim",
BG: 'Kingsley Amis' (qv)' classic, was made into a movie. But, she was not
BG: seen in many a film, except during the sixties, either in Canada or in
BG: the U.S. On the contrary, she has been very active on TV, first in
BG: Canada from the age of 19, then in the U.S. in made-for-TV movies or
BG: series like _"Star Trek" (1966)_ (qv),
BG: _"Mission: Impossible" (1966)_ (qv), _"Gunsmoke" (1955)_ (qv),
BG: _"Marcus Welby, M.D." (1969)_ (qv), _"Barnaby Jones" (1973)_ (qv), etc.
BG: She was a regular in the series
BG: _"The Bold Ones: The Senator" (1970)_ (qv) for one year and played
BG: "Della Street" in the short-lived _"The New Perry Mason" (1973)_ (qv).
BG: A talented actress seen too little in movie theaters.

TR: * Founded Windham Hill Records in 1976 as a way of promoting his own music
TR:   (the first record released was his own first record: The Search for the
TR:   Turtle's Navel - now renamed In Search of the Turtle's Navel). The
TR:   record company quickly became the number one independent record company
TR:   in the United States, known for its incredibly unique and
TR:   unclassifiable music. Throughout the late 80s, Windham Hill fell into a
TR:   slew with other pseudo-"New Age" record companies, which in turn hurt
TR:   the label. Although the label did incredibly well even through the 90s,
TR:   Ackerman sold his interests to Sony/BMG music in 1992, claiming the
TR:   company was too big for his interests. The record company continues to
TR:   do well, though the artists who recorded during the "Ackerman" era
TR:   subsequently left recording with the album in order to keep their music
TR:   independent. Ackerman currently runs and produces a new independent
TR:   record company: Imaginary Road Music and Imaginary Road Studios.
TR: * Is well known for his unique open tunings on his guitar compositions.

QU: * Actors are some of the most driven, courageous people on the face of the
QU:   earth. They deal with more day-to-day rejection in one year than most
QU:   people do in a lifetime. Every day, actors face the financial challenge
QU:   of living a freelance lifestyle, the disrespect of people who think
QU:   they should get real jobs, and their own fear that they'll never work
QU:   again. Every day, they have to ignore the possibility that the vision
QU:   they have dedicated their lives to is a pipe dream. With every role,
QU:   they stretch themselves, emotionally and physically, risking criticism
QU:   and judgment. With every passing year, many of them watch as the other
QU:   people their age achieve the predictable milestones of normal life -
QU:   the car, the family, the house, the nest egg. Why? Because actors are
QU:   willing to give their entire lives to a moment - to that line, that
QU:   laugh, that gesture, or that interpretation that will stir the
QU:   audience's soul. Actors are beings who have tasted life's nectar in
QU:   that crystal moment when they poured out their creative spirit and
QU:   touched another's heart. In that instant, they were as close to magic,
QU:   God, and perfection as anyone could ever be. And in their own hearts,
QU:   they know that to dedicate oneself to that moment is worth a thousand
QU:   lifetimes.

NM: Ackland, Joss

RN: Sidney Edmond Jocelyn Ackland

DB: 29 February 1928, North Kensington, London, England, UK

HT: 6' 1"

BG: Joss Ackland, the distinguished English actor who has appeared in over
BG: 100 movies, scores of plays and a plethora of television programs in
BG: his six-decade career, was born Sidney Edmond Jocelyn Ackland on
BG: February 29, 1928, in North Kensington, London. After attending
BG: London's Central School of Speech and Drama, the 17-year-old Ackland
BG: made his professional stage debut in "The Hasty Heart" in 1945.
BG: 
BG: Although he first appeared on film in 'John Boulting' (qv)'s and
BG: 'Roy Boulting' (qv)'s Oscar-winning thriller
BG: _Seven Days to Noon (1950)_ (qv) in an uncredited bit role, he made his
BG: credited debut in a supporting role in 'Vernon Sewell' (qv)'s
BG: _Ghost Ship (1952)_ (qv). He would not again grace the big screen until
BG: the end of the decade. Instead, Ackland spent the latter half of the
BG: 1940s and the first half of the 1950s honing his craft in regional
BG: theatrical companies.
BG: 
BG: In 1955 he left the English stage behind and moved to Africa to manage a
BG: tea plantation, an experience that likely informed his heralded
BG: performance 20 years later in _White Mischief (1987)_ (qv). In his two
BG: years in Africa he wrote plays and did service as a radio disc jockey.
BG: Upon his return to England in 1957, he joined the Old Vic company.
BG: 
BG: From 1962-64 he served as associate director of the Mermaid Theatre.
BG: Subsequently, his stage acting career primarily was in London's
BG: commercial West End theater, where he made a name for himself in
BG: musicals. He was distinguished as Captain Hook in the musical version
BG: of "Peter Pan" and as Juan Peron in "Evita". In the straight theater he
BG: was a memorable Falstaff in 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)'s "Henry IV
BG: Parts 1 & 2" and as Captain Shotover in 'George Bernard Shaw' (qv)'s
BG: "Heartbreak House". In the 1960s Ackland began appearing more regularly
BG: in films, and his career as a movie character actor picked up rapidly
BG: in the 1970s and began to flourish in the 1980s. It has shown little
BG: sign of abating in the 21st century, even though he's well into his
BG: 70s.
BG: 
BG: In addition to his performance in "White Mischief", among his more
BG: notable turns as an actor before the camera came in the BBC-TV
BG: production of _Shadowlands (1985) (TV)_ (qv), in which he played 'C.S.
BG: Lewis', and in _Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)_ (qv) as the South African
BG: heavy.
BG: 
BG: He is the father of seven children, whom he listed as his "hobby" in a
BG: 1981 interview. On December 31, 2000, Joss Ackland was named a
BG: Commander of the British Empire on the New Year's Honours List for his
BG: 50 years of service to the English stage, cinema and television.

BG: Jensen Ross Ackles, or better known as just Jensen Ackles, was born on
BG: March 1, 1978, in Dallas, Texas, to actor 'Alan Ackles' (qv) and Donna
BG: Shaffer. He grew up in Richardson, Texas, together with his older
BG: brother, Joshua, and a younger sister, Mackenzie.
BG: 
BG: Jensen graduated from Dartmouth Elementary School in 1990, he graduated
BG: from Apollo Junior High School in 1993, and LV Berkner High School in
BG: 1996. Jensen, who is of Irish, British and German ancestry, is a sports
BG: junkie. He loves football, lacrosse, baseball and basketball. He even
BG: played on the baseball and lacrosse teams in high school.
BG: 
BG: The 6' 1" actor first started modeling when he was just 2 years old.
BG: When he turned 4, he started appearing in TV commercials for Nabisco,
BG: RadioShack and Wal-Mart. He caught the acting bug because he was mostly
BG: influenced by his father, who was an actor in Dallas. He used to watch
BG: his father study scripts, and that taught him a few things about the
BG: industry. During his later years in high school, he started taking
BG: theater classes, where he claimed he was the only "jock" in that
BG: department.
BG: 
BG: When he was just a sophomore, a friend of Jensen had asked him to attend
BG: a local acting seminar. Two guys, Craig Wargo, and an agent, 'Michael
BG: Einfeld', were interested in Jensen's talent and wanted him to go to
BG: Los Angeles with them. Jensen had to say no to the offer and admitted
BG: at one point, he thought they would forget about him but, eventually,
BG: when he went to Los Angeles, he still managed to get help from them.
BG: Prior to that, Jensen actually planned to study sports medicine at
BG: Texas Tech University and become a physical therapist, before he
BG: decided to move to Los Angeles to give acting a try.
BG: 
BG: In 1996, he managed to secure guest roles on several TV shows, which
BG: included _"Wishbone" (1995)_ (qv), _"Mr. Rhodes" (1996)_ (qv),
BG: _"7th Heaven" (1996)_ (qv) and _"Sweet Valley High" (1994)_ (qv).
BG: Jensen's big break came when he was cast in the NBC soap opera,
BG: _"Days of Our Lives" (1965)_ (qv), as Eric Brady in 1997. He won a Soap
BG: Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer in 1998, and was nominated
BG: three times in 1998, 1999, and 2000 for a Daytime Emmy Award for
BG: Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his work on
BG: _"Days of Our Lives" (1965)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: After spending about three years on a soap set, he left
BG: _"Days of Our Lives" (1965)_ (qv) and went on to appear in the
BG: mini-series _"Blonde" (2001)_ (qv), which was about the life of
BG: 'Marilyn Monroe' (qv), playing Eddie G. He also auditioned for the role
BG: of Clark Kent on _"Smallville" (2001)_ (qv), but lost the part to
BG: 'Tom Welling' (qv), instead.
BG: 
BG: Not giving up hope, he went for a few auditions and managed to secure a
BG: guest role on the popular 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) TV series,
BG: _"Dark Angel" (2000)_ (qv), as serial killer Ben/X5-493, the brother of
BG: main character Max/X5-452, who was played by 'Jessica Alba' (qv). His
BG: character died in the episode, but Jensen eventually returned to the
BG: show as a regular in the second season as Ben's clone, Alec/X5-494 and
BG: continued on until the show's cancellation in 2002.
BG: 
BG: In 2003, he joined the cast of _"Dawson's Creek" (1998)_ (qv), playing
BG: the role of C.J., Jen Lindley's lover. He also filmed episodes of the
BG: TV series, _"Still Life" (2003)_ (qv), playing the role of Max Morgan,
BG: not knowing that the series was actually dropped. He also had a small
BG: role in the short film, _The Plight of Clownana (2004)_ (qv), playing
BG: the role of Jensen.
BG: 
BG: That same year, he was offered the part of 'Eliza Dushku' (qv)'s love
BG: interest on the second season of _"Tru Calling" (2003)_ (qv). Jensen,
BG: however, turned down the role which was later offered to another actor,
BG: 'Eric Christian Olsen' (qv). He was subsequently cast on
BG: _"Smallville" (2001)_ (qv), as Assistant football coach Jason Teague,
BG: the new love interest of Lana Lang.
BG: 
BG: In 2005, Jensen managed to earn a lead role in the movie,
BG: _Devour (2005) (V)_ (qv), playing the role of Jake Gray. Jensen also
BG: earned the opportunity to work his father, actor 'Alan Ackles' (qv),
BG: who happened to play his character's father, Paul Kilton. The movie,
BG: however, received mixed reviews from the public.
BG: 
BG: That same year, Jensen joined the cast of the CW series,
BG: _"Supernatural" (2005)_ (qv), where he plays the role of Dean
BG: Winchester. Dean and his brother Sam, who is played by
BG: 'Jared Padalecki' (qv), are brothers who drive throughout the United
BG: States hunting paranormal predators, sometimes with their father, John
BG: Winchester, played by 'Jeffrey Dean Morgan' (qv). It was reported that
BG: the creator of the show, 'Eric Kripke' (qv), mentioned that the show
BG: will last for a maximum of five seasons.
BG: 
BG: In 2006, Jensen took on a role in the Independently filmed comedy/drama
BG: movie, _Ten Inch Hero (2007)_ (qv), which explores the theme of honesty
BG: and the flaw of judging by appearances. In 2007 the film began a
BG: limited run at number of film festivals including the Newport Beach
BG: Film Festival, Phoenix Film Festival and the Santa Cruz Film Festival
BG: but never made it into major mainstream theatrical release. In the
BG: Spring of 2008 Ten Inch Hero was released onto DVD exclusively through
BG: Blockbuster. Jensen however, received high praise for his work as
BG: Priestly, who one of the movie's more quirky characters.
BG: 
BG: From June 5-10 in 2007 Jensen had his professional stage debut as Lt.
BG: Daniel Kaffee in "A Few Good Men" at Casa Manana Theatre in Fort Worth,
BG: Texas, working along side 'Lou Diamond Phillips' (qv). This proved to
BG: be another successful acting venture for Jensen, as critics were
BG: impressed with his work in this role.
BG: 
BG: During his free time, Jensen enjoys golfing, horseback riding, scuba
BG: diving and photography. He is also a big fan of country music. His
BG: favorite musician is 'Garth Brooks' (qv). He even sang back-up vocals
BG: on good friend 'Steve Carlson (VI)' (qv)'s albums "Spot in the Corner"
BG: and "Rollin' On."
BG: 
BG: In the Summer of 2008 Jensen traveled to Kittaning, PA to film the
BG: horror/thriller movie, _My Bloody Valentine (2009)_ (qv), which was
BG: filmed in the cutting edge Real D technology, Jensen played the lead
BG: role of Tom Hanniger and starred alongside 'Jaime King (I)' (qv) and
BG: 'Kerr Smith' (qv). Jensen splits his off time between Burbank,
BG: California and Vancouver, British Columbia.

QU:   It gives us the opportunity to make the relationship between Sam and

QU: * Some people will go to the opening of an envelope. They live their lives

BG: Veteran stage and TV actor David Ackroyd was born on May 30, 1940 in
BG: Orange, New Jersey, the son of Arthur, an insurance adjuster, and
BG: Charlotte (nee Henderson) Ackroyd. He studied at Bucknell University in
BG: Pennsylvania where he received his BA in 1962 as an ROTC student.
BG: Following his graduation he appeared in community theater productions
BG: while serving in Arizona with the military. He then focused on the arts
BG: as a career after enrolling at the Yale Drama School where he earned
BG: his Masters of Fine Arts in 1968.
BG: 
BG: David gathered early professional credits at the Yale Repertory Theatre
BG: (for three seasons) and Williamstown Theatre Festival (for six
BG: seasons). He also found challenging and varied stage work outside the
BG: U.S. in Taiwan, Russia, Poland, Germany, France, and the Czech
BG: Republic.
BG: 
BG: Dark-haired with a serious handsomeness to him, he was able to extend
BG: his all-stage career into film and TV in the early 1970s, beginning
BG: with daytime leading man outings in "The Secret Storm" and "Another
BG: World". He progressed to prime time work as Gary Ewing in
BG: _"Dallas" (1978)_ (qv) until 'Ted Shackelford' (qv) successfully took
BG: over the role when the character moved front and center with the
BG: spin-off drama _"Knots Landing" (1979)_ (qv). David's prime on-camera
BG: work occurred in the late 70s with a series of strong co-star roles in
BG: the mini-series _"The Dark Secret of Harvest Home" (1978)_ (qv) with
BG: 'Bette Davis' (qv) and _"The Word" (1978)_ (qv), as well as the
BG: TV-movies _And I Alone Survived (1978) (TV)_ (qv) and
BG: _Women in White (1979) (TV)_ (qv). He then began to find supporting
BG: roles in such movies as _The Mountain Men (1980)_ (qv),
BG: _The Sound of Murder (1982)_ (qv), _Wrestling with God (1990)_ (qv),
BG: _Dark Angel (1990)_ (qv) and _Prison Life (2000)_ (qv); however, film
BG: stardom eluded him.
BG: 
BG: Prone to playing upscale types or white-collar professionals (senators,
BG: doctors, lawyers, etc.), he appeared as a guest star on such popular
BG: programs as "Hotel", "Dynasty", "Highway to Heaven", "Murder She Wrote"
BG: and "MacGyver". He also continued to prevail on the stage with potent
BG: performances in "Unlikely Heroes", his 1971 Broadway debut, "The
BG: Rivals", "Juno and the Paycock", "Hamlet" (as Rosencrantz), "Private
BG: Lives" "Children of a Lesser God" (replacing original star
BG: 'John Rubinstein' (qv)), "A Soldier's Play", "Who's Afraid of Virginia
BG: Woolf?", "Six Characters in Search of an Author", and, more recently,
BG: off-Broadway in 2003 with "It Just Catches". A well-seasoned narrator
BG: in documentary stories for the History Channel, he has sometimes
BG: utilized his well-modulated vocals for such animated cartoons as
BG: "Johnny Quest" and "Captain Planet and the Planeteers". Most of his
BG: work of late comes in the form of voice work.
BG: 
BG: Long married to wife Ruth Liming, a college admissions officer, the
BG: couple has two daughters, Jessica and Abigail. Living in Montana where
BG: he is a professor of drama at Flathead Valley Community College in
BG: Kalispell, David is also one of the founding members of the Alpine
BG: Theatre Project which produces plays for the Whitefish Theatre Company.

HT: 6'

BG: Leon was born in Kokomo, Indiana on May 23, 1963, and grew up on several
BG: different farms in the area. Moving frequently led Leon to develop a
BG: fantasy life at an early age, and he acted in high-school and
BG: community-theatre productions throughout Indiana.
BG: 
BG: He attended Indiana University at Kokomo. He landed his first paying
BG: show-biz gig during this time - an amateur-night appearance at The Club

BG: years shy of legal drinking age, Leon hid out in the dressing room
BG: between sets.
BG: 
BG: Leon moved to San Francisco in the late 1980s, studying his craft in

BG: an extended three-month run at Theatre Rhino before moving to
BG: Off-Broadway.
BG: 
BG: Leon continued to play a variety of roles in both film and theatre while
BG: in the Bay Area. He starred in the award-winning film thriller

BG: feature "Final Remains" (a.k.a. "Mortuary"), and the shorts "The
BG: Currycomb" and "A Quiet Place."
BG: 
BG: On stage, he won raves and delighted audiences in 2002 with his
BG: portrayal of British raconteur Quentin Crisp in Jeffrey Hartgraves' hit
BG: comedy "Carved in Stone" at Eureka Theatre (which Leon also
BG: co-produced).
BG: 
BG: He enjoyed a long, successful association with New Conservatory Theatre
BG: Center, starring as "Brad" in the West Coast premiere of Jonathan
BG: Tollins' "The Last Sunday in June;" as the title character in "Message
BG: to Michael," as the Narrator in "Dream Boy," based on the novel by Jim

TR:   by allowing him to play lighter opposite the two female leads, but more
TR:   grounded in scenes with Devon's boyfriend, played by DeVone Minters.
TR:   
TR:   In the final scene, in which Devon describes seducing the man who stole
TR:   his boyfriend, Acord insisted on adding the line "I'm kidding! I'm
TR:   kidding!" so his character would not be perceived as overly
TR:   promiscuous.

QU: * Regarding what he calls his "Sharon Stone moment" at the beginning of
QU:   the film "Foucault Who?", in which he urinates on screen: "When I first
QU:   read the script, I thought, 'I hope they don't expect me to actually
QU:   pee on camera!' Director Jed Bell said no, that he didn't plan to shoot
QU:   it that way. But it was the last scene we shot -- and by the time we
QU:   got to it, I realized that the tone of the film would be immediately
QU:   established if I did. Jed agreed. So I loaded up on liquids, and didn't
QU:   go to the bathroom all day. Jed closed the set to essential personnel,
QU:   but I still had a terrible time getting it to happen! There must be a
QU:   10-minute outtake out there somewhere of me standing there, waiting for
QU:   it to happen."

NM: Acosta, Boris

HT: 5' 7"

BG: From his early days in life, starting at the age of 4, Boris Acosta was
BG: highly influenced in music, as his father took him around where he was
BG: playing. During that time his mother would take him to see the latest
BG: movies at a movie theater where an uncle of his was the manager. Later,
BG: when he was 6 years old, he found the art of painting and did this for
BG: many years as he was encouraged and tutored by one of his uncles. When
BG: he was 8, he had his first experience as a movie maker wearing as many
BG: hats as any filmmaker can wear. He found a large magnifying glass,
BG: about 8 inches in diameter. He played with it in the sun burning papers
BG: and grass with it. Then, he thought that there had to be a better
BG: purpose for such a big magnifying glass. So, he built a wooden box,
BG: made a whole in front of it to fit the magnifying glass, and, with the
BG: help of his grandfather, put a light in the back of the box. He bought
BG: two issues of the same comic magazine, which he cut into strips and
BG: glued them together by their edges to make a big roll out of them. He
BG: put the roll of comic strips in between the light and the magnifying
BG: glass and projected it on the wall. One could say that this was the
BG: first home projector ever, but he never thought of it that way.
BG: However, this was certainly Acosta's first film. Later he was invited
BG: to act in a college film, and after graduating he produced several
BG: educational films. One clue at a time, would later find himself working
BG: in the film industry as a producer and director of the second best
BG: Christian story ever told, The Divine Comedy - Dante's Inferno,
BG: Purgatorio and Paradiso.
BG: 
BG: Boris Acosta studied The Divine Comedy and all minor works written by
BG: Dante Alighieri in primitive Italian at the University of California,
BG: Los Angeles (UCLA).
BG: 
BG: Boris Acosta has earned a high reputation from Dantisti around the world
BG: for making films that are truly Dante's way, something that nobody has
BG: been able to do since 1911. He is well respected in Hollywood for his
BG: convictions, passion and a man of one word.
BG: 
BG: Boris Acosta, a citizen of the United States, is fluent in English,
BG: Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. He was born from Italian and
BG: Portuguese family. Graduated in Applied Mathematics (Scientific
BG: Programming) with minors in Computer Engineering and Italian Literature
BG: from the University of California. He also did post-graduate studies in
BG: International Business.
BG: 
BG: Boris Acosta lived most of his life in the United States, but also in
BG: Italy, Austria, Canada, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, and has traveled
BG: extensively throughout the world.

HT: 5' 8"

BG: The son of Lydia and Robert Acosta, Jared Robert Acosta was born August
BG: 20th, 1979 in Queens, New York. When he was less than a year old his
BG: family moved to Stroudsburg, PA where he was raised with his two
BG: sisters Olivia and Leslie. From a young age, Jared would write plays
BG: that he and his cousins would perform during family functions on sets
BG: he and his grandfather George Vega (who also built the collapsible
BG: furniture for Saturday Night Live's Samurai skits in the 1970s) had
BG: built. At 12 years old he spent a short time as a runway model before
BG: entering his awkward teen years. Just before his 18th birthday he and
BG: two friends opened a head shop called "The Odyssey," but numerous
BG: break-ins caused the store to close six months later. Shortly after
BG: that Jared joined the US Army Reserves where he was eventually
BG: discharged due to a severe injury to his right hand. Upon returning to
BG: civilian life he began selling cars while attending East Stroudsburg
BG: University. He was certain by this point he wanted to get into
BG: entertainment but was unsure just how to do it. He and another friend
BG: began planning a concert, but unable to obtain outside financing, were
BG: forced to think outside the box. They formed a small technology firm
BG: Down Under Consulting to raise to the money, despite their best effort,
BG: internal squabble forced the company's dissolve a short time later. It
BG: wasn't until 2006 that alongside music producer Michael Calderone,
BG: Jared organized and produced his first full scale concert. The
BG: following year the pair had thrown numerous music festivals until
BG: Michael had received a recording contract with Armada Music. Although
BG: offered a management position with his partner, Jared knew there was
BG: little room for advancement and held out for another opportunity. In
BG: 2009, Director Nick Stagliano offered Jared a chance to help produce
BG: his feature film "Good Day For It." Since then he has helped produce
BG: several films including Jay Alaimo's "Chlorine" and has appeared in
BG: such shows as NBC's "30 Rock" and Fox's "Running Wilde," where he is
BG: featured as Steve Wilde's personal gardener.

NM: Acreman, Kellie

BG: Kellie Acreman has achieved a great deal as a DJ in a very short space
BG: of time. Having performed at gigs all over the UK and worldwide over
BG: the last 3 years she has consistently proved her abilities as a leading
BG: Female DJ destroying the decks and the competition wherever she goes.
BG: Her success was cemented in 2009 when she was declared the "World's
BG: Sexiest DJ" (Nuts Magazine July 2009) with acclaim and support from one
BG: of the world's leading DJ's -the infamous Judge Jules (Radio 1).
BG: 
BG: The 28 year old model / DJ, originally from Torquay in Devon, decided to
BG: leave the country life behind in 2005 and follow her dream of becoming
BG: a successful glamor model in the bright city lights of London. She
BG: began her career in the now infamous 'FHM High Street Honeys'
BG: competition and achieved runner up position and a sexy double page
BG: spread in the magazine. This caught the eye of one of the top London
BG: Model agents who immediately saw Kellie's potential and recognized her
BG: determination. From here the 'FHM Honey's Tour' was conceived which was
BG: a new concept in UK clubs and venues. Kellie featured prominently in
BG: all the shows and the success of the tour lead to regular photo-shoots
BG: in a wide variety of leading magazines and tabloids including the Daily
BG: Star, FHM, Maxim, Loaded, Front, Zoo and Nuts. This also led to major
BG: underwear campaigns for Victoria Silvestedst and Janet Reger lingerie
BG: lines. Kellie soon became recognized further afield and went on to do
BG: several shoots in exotic locations, including Miami, and as a result
BG: she has an ever growing fan base in the US, Germany, Australia and
BG: Spain -territories that continue to use Kellie's pictures for
BG: publications.
BG: 
BG: Always on the go and with a sheer determination to succeed alongside a
BG: deep passion for music, Kellie taught herself to DJ, initially just for
BG: fun. This proved her natural talent and ability to master the
BG: technicalities involved and 3 years on Kellie's success is evident. She
BG: has DJ'ed in a range of exclusive clubs all over the world including
BG: Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Miami, Chicago, Spain, Chamonix, London, Egypt,
BG: Moscow, Croatia, India, China, Kavos, London and many, many more. She
BG: is also the DJ of choice for many celebrity parties - so far she's
BG: played for Neyo, Jenna Jameson, T-Pain and Lindsay Lohan. This
BG: particular event attracted a great deal of attention from the UK and
BG: worldwide press as it was reported that Kellie and her regular DJ
BG: partner Lauren Pope were requested by Lindsay to spin for her to get
BG: back at on / off girlfriend at the time Samantha Ronson. As a result,
BG: on a DJ trip to Miami Kellie was relentlessly followed by the paparazzi
BG: - further proof of her international recognition and success.
BG: 
BG: This career move has now become Kellie's main focus due to the amazing
BG: success she has achieved. So much so, she has taken the next step up by
BG: producing and providing vocals on her own tracks. She has worked
BG: alongside some prominent producers and has signed one of her
BG: productions to a very well known and well respected record label.
BG: Kellie is now working on more tracks for release later in the year.
BG: 
BG: Kellie's next major step is to conquer the American market. Having
BG: already played at LIV (at the Fontainebleau) in Miami, and Y Bar and
BG: Enclave in Chicago there are further plans to hit LA and Vegas in 2011.
BG: She also has a tour of Australia in the pipeline as well as a tour of
BG: India fronting the Playboy Energy Drink Launch.
BG: 
BG: Kellie's natural humor and vibrant personality has also caught the eye
BG: of a major TV production company who have invited her to do a screen
BG: test for one of their popular TV shows.... 2011 looks set to be another
BG: very busy and very successful year for Ms Acreman.
BG: 
BG: Kellie's natural ability in front of the camera has also led to TV and
BG: acting work. She showed her fiery side when she took part in a
BG: celebrity/model boxing tournament called 'Catfight'. This involved 14
BG: of the the UK's top models battling it out in the boxing ring after an
BG: intense 6 months of hardcore training in the UK and Tenerife. Kellie's
BG: boxing ability impressed one of her trainers so much she was asked to
BG: fight for his boxing club! Kellie declined this offer as she wanted to
BG: keep her model looks intact!

HT: 5' 10"

BG: Eddie Acuff is one of those wonderful supporting actors who peopled the
BG: fascinating world of Hollywood's A, B or Z movies. In a career spanning
BG: eighteen years he appeared in the amazing number of 251 movies and 1 TV
BG: episode! His appearances could be invisible (when deleted), hardly
BG: visible (he portrayed an endless series of cabbies, reporters,
BG: cameramen, cowboys, hamburger vendors, orderlies, ticket agents,
BG: militiamen, bus drivers, the lot...), short but recurring (he was the
BG: accident-prone mailman in the 'Blondie' series after Irving Bacon gave
BG: up the part) or more fleshed out, notably as the sidekick in various
BG: serials. Anyway, he nearly always played - in a very talented way - the
BG: wise-cracking guy who "knows better". Born on June 3rd 1903, Edward
BG: Acuff was drawn to acting under the influence of his maternal uncle,
BG: who had been a performer on showboats along the Mississippi. Before
BG: going to Hollywood, Eddie Acuff started a theater career, and even
BG: played on Broadway (in minor roles of course) in plays such as 'The
BG: Dark Hour', 'Heat Lightning' or 'Yellow Jack'. From 1934 to 1951 (five
BG: years before his untimely death following a sudden heart attack), Eddie
BG: Acuff worked and worked and worked. Only a few of his films are
BG: classics ('The Petrified Forest', 'They Drive By Night', 'High Sierra',
BG: 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', 'Johnny Allegro')...So what? Seeing
BG: but a glimpse of Acuff is always a dose of pleasure guaranteed. Eddie
BG: Acuff is buried at the North Hollywood Pierce Brothers Valhalla
BG: Memorial Park.

BG: Kyle was very active in sports growing up and had always wanted to be a

BG: major injury occur his sophomore year of high school while running the
BG: 100 meter dash at a track meet. As he came out of the starting blocks
BG: he broke his hip, and had to spend the next week in bed with his leg
BG: elevated, and the next six months on crutches. The doctors told him he
BG: could play sports again but if he was to get hit just right again on
BG: his hip it could cause permanent damage. It's not his manner to give up
BG: he played on in high school, and in his last football game as a senior
BG: was hit with a helmet on his bad hip and he was unable to run after
BG: that. The injury was enough to keep him out of his senior year of
BG: basketball too.
BG: 
BG: He never did play organized sports again, and began to wonder about an
BG: acting career. He was always involved in drama in high school and
BG: college, but never thought about it as a career. He went on to get a
BG: degree in computer science and began working directly after college. He
BG: worked the typical office job from 8-5 for six years before realizing
BG: that his dream was out there and he was not doing anything about it. He
BG: decided to leave the steady paycheck and take off for California to
BG: pursue his dream of acting. He always said if he can't play pro
BG: football maybe he can get paid to pretend he is a pro football player.
BG: He has been working hard at his dream and he is starting to have some
BG: success, with just the right break the world will see what they have

DB: 23 May 1952, Lynchburg, Virginia, USA

BG: Deborah Adair was born in Lynchburg, Virginia on May 23, 1952 to a
BG: father who was a Navy officer and a mother who was a Spanish teacher.
BG: She grew up with her brother Ashley and sister Ann. Her major
BG: influences were her mother and grandmother who always taught her to
BG: have confidence and self-assurance by telling her that she can have any
BG: job she wanted. She earned a degree in advertising and marketing at
BG: University of Washington, working afterward as a copywriter, commercial
BG: producer and assistant promotion manager for radio stations in Seattle,
BG: Washington. Her four-year marriage to Gary Baker, a budding politician,
BG: ended in 1978, prompting her to move to Hollywood. She waited tables
BG: and worked as a stewardess for a short time. But a flair for dramatic
BG: reading in high school led to voice-over work on commercials, then
BG: local stage productions. She found an agent who helped her land small
BG: parts in several TV series. But her big break came in 1980 when she was
BG: cast as Jill Foster Abbott on "The Young and the Restless." She was the
BG: third actress to play that role, but she made the character her own by
BG: playing her as a beautiful, sparkly bad girl. In 1983, she left daytime
BG: soap opera during stalled contract negotiations to accept the role of
BG: Tracy Kendall on highly rated night time soap opera "Dynasty," where
BG: she played yet another bad girl.
BG: 
BG: Aaron Spelling, the producer on Dynasty, was so impressed with her
BG: performance that he took her off Dynasty a year later and gave her the
BG: lead role of Daisy Lloyd on another prime time show "Finder of Lost
BG: Loves," where she finally played a good girl. But that show was
BG: canceled a year later and Adair guest-starred on other shows, including
BG: Spelling's "Love Boat" and "Hotel." In 1986, "The Young and the
BG: Restless" producers beckoned her back for one week to reprise her role
BG: as Jill when Brenda Dickson was out for a short time due to tension on
BG: the set. Adair maintained she had fun for that one week playing Jill,
BG: but Dickson remembered it differently when she unexpectedly came back
BG: to find Adair in the dressing room being uncomfortable. A few months
BG: later, Dickson left the role and Jess Walton was hired as a permanent
BG: replacement for Dickson. Of the four actresses who have played Jill
BG: since 1973, Adair is forever remembered as the "pretty Jill." But she
BG: was frustrated that her career had stalled just when her personal life
BG: gained momentum. She married producer Chip Hayes in 1987, and although
BG: it was a very happy marriage, she couldn't have children and it made
BG: her unhappy at the time. In 1990, Adair was performing in previews of
BG: Cynthia Heimel's play "A Girl's Guide to Chaos," when she had a freaky
BG: accident and herniated a disk. The accident caused her excruciating
BG: pain and she spent a year, on and off, in bed. She did some soul
BG: searching during that time and felt that everything happens in its own
BG: time.
BG: 
BG: After she recovered, she picked up the pieces of her career and moved on
BG: to do a TV movie for Aaron Spelling titled Rich Men, Single Women
BG: (1990) where she played opposite another Spelling favorite Heather
BG: Locklear. And her career picked up even more steam when Spelling
BG: reunited her with Locklear in the recurring role as Lucy Cabot on his
BG: primetime show Melrose Place (1992). She enjoyed being on the show
BG: because she spent a lot of time with her husband Hayes, who was one of
BG: the producers. While on "Melrose Place," she originated the role of
BG: Kate Roberts on "Days of Our Lives" and became one of the few actors in
BG: history who had both a daytime soap opera and a nighttime soap opera at
BG: the same time. She left "Melrose Place" after one year to concentrate
BG: on the multi-dimensional role of Kate on "Days of our Lives," and her
BG: gamble paid off as she won the Best Supporting Actress Award at the
BG: Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1994. But Adair and her husband wanted
BG: children. In 1995, she left her "Days of Our Lives" role to be a
BG: full-time mom after she and her husband adopted a child. Although,
BG: Lauren Koslow took over the role and played it for more than 15 years,
BG: Adair's fans cannot seem to forget her and hopes she will return to
BG: acting. But she enjoys the role of being real life mom so much that she
BG: and her husband adopted another child in 1997. For now, Adair seems
BG: content with her home life in Virginia and has not expressed any desire
BG: to return to acting, much to the chagrin of her fans.

NM: Adair-Rios, Mark

BG: Mark Adair-Rios' work and projects-in-development blow the lid off what
BG: it means to be a working actor in Hollywood. Raised as a San Fernando
BG: Valley boy, his multi-ethnic heritage keeps Casting guessing and lands
BG: him roles that range from gang member to techno geek, psychotic killer
BG: to misogynist cop, and HR trainer to LA transvestite.
BG: 
BG: His career began when cast as a child actor in a national Coke
BG: commercial. In his near 20 year tenure since then, Mark has racked up
BG: tons of television roles such as: +Recurring cast on "CSI: Miami",
BG: "Jericho", "MDs", "The Evidence", "Baywatch Hawaii", "Danny Fricke"
BG: (pilot), and "NYPD Blue" (as Nicholas Torturro's drug-addicted brother)
BG: +Series Regular on "Legend" and "1994 Baker Street"(pilot) +Guest Star
BG: on "Cold Case", "Las Vegas", "NCIS", "ER", "JAG", "The Division",
BG: "According to Jim", "Charmed", "Family Matters", "Terminator: Sarah
BG: Connor Chronicles", "Threat Matrix", "Cuts", "Diagnosis Murder", "Tracy
BG: Takes On"..., and numerous others (see Resume). +Co Star on "Life Goes
BG: On" and "Space: Above and Beyond".
BG: 
BG: In feature film, Mark has performed opposite: +Ben Stiller and Philip
BG: Seymour Hoffman in "Along Came Polly" +Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty"
BG: +Gabriel Byrne in "Stigmata" +Denzel Washington in "Courage Under Fire"
BG: +Eddie Murphy in Dr. Doolittle +Matthew Perry & Selma Hayek in "Fool's
BG: Rush In" +and in "Speed 2", "Crocodile Dundee In LA". ...And then some.
BG: 
BG: No stranger to indy films, either, he appears in "Zero Hour", "The
BG: Longest Yard Sale", "Flying Virus", "Stealth Fighter", and others. (His
BG: commercial credits include "Playstation3", "Taco Bell", "Honey Bunches
BG: of Oats", "State Farm Insurance", and "Tostitos"-all within the same
BG: year.)
BG: 
BG: Mark loves to play nasty drama as the bad guy, but Casting Directors now
BG: tap his comedic skill set, too. He had a hilarious time completing a
BG: 4-episode pilot titled "Love That Girl" with Tatiana Ali (Fresh Prince
BG: of Bel Air) and Phil Morris (Seinfeld, Smallville). He portrays Adonis,
BG: one-half of a modern-day, gay Lenny-and-Squigy-type duo-the next-door
BG: neighbors who always show off their fabulous diva selves.
BG: 
BG: Besides jamming as a well-rounded industry-trained actor, Mark also
BG: partners with comic actor Chris Coppola to write and produce TV pilots.
BG: One new half-hour comedy follows two Armenian immigrants who have to
BG: dress as women to survive in Glendale (CA) while waiting for their big
BG: break into show biz. Mark's vast industry experience allows him to
BG: launch full-throttle into production with viable ideas to create new
BG: shows. He and Chris are getting folks to laugh their butts off with a
BG: kids' TV series and 2 feature concepts, also in the works.
BG: 
BG: To keep his creative juices flowing, Mark jumps back to the stage. He
BG: has taught classical Children's Theatre for 7 years at the Lost Studio
BG: (formerly Peggy Feury's Loft). He also digs into theatre study there
BG: full-time (5 days a week!) when not working on film or TV projects. At
BG: least once a year, he always struts his stuff in a production on the
BG: proscenium boards (and garners more noteworthy reviews). Such plays
BG: recently include the UK hit "Bouncer's", Chekhov's "The Marriage
BG: Proposal", Pinter's "A Night Out" and "Night School", Carlos Lacamara's
BG: "Nowhere on the Border", "Becoming Cuban", and the upcoming
BG: "Exiles"-interpreting a hardcore Cuban convict who mutinies on a yacht
BG: full of Marielista immigrants, to take over as de facto captain.
BG: 
BG: Little known fact: Mark stopped out of college to pursue acting
BG: professionally while studying to become an FBI agent. He spends his
BG: rare spare time playing guitar, publishing his poetry, and engaging in
BG: fabulous new adventures (real espionage not included).

NM: Adam, Adolphe

RN: Adolphe Charles Adam

DB: 24 July 1803, Paris, France

DD: 3 May 1856, Paris, France

BG: Adolphe Charles Adam was born on July 24, 1803 in Paris, France. His
BG: father was Jean Louis Adam, the acclaimed concert pianist and professor
BG: of piano at the Paris Conservatory. Adolph Adam enrolled in the Paris
BG: Conservatory against his father's will in 1817. There he studied piano,
BG: and from 1821 also studied composition under Francois Boieldieu.
BG: 
BG: Adam is credited for developing a genre of the 'opera-comique', a French
BG: opera with extended recitative, a spoken dialog, not necessarily comic.
BG: The development of such a genre was welcomed by many professional
BG: actors, who did not possess opera-quality voices. Among his important
BG: operas are "Pierre et Catherine" (1829), "Danilowa" (1830), "Le Chalet"
BG: (1834), "Le Brasseur de preston" (1838), "Regine, ou Les Deux Nuits"
BG: (1839), "Le Rose de Peronne" (1841), "Lambert Simnel" (1843). "Richard
BG: en Palestine" (1844), "Cagliastro" (1844), "Le Toreador, ou L'Accord
BG: parfait" (1849), "La Paupee de Nuremberg" (1852), "Le Roi des Halles"
BG: (1853), 'La Muleter de Tolede" (1854), and "Falstaff" (1856), among
BG: many of his other operas.
BG: 
BG: Adolphe Adam is best known for his classic ballets "Faust" (1832),
BG: "Giselle" (1840), and "Le Corsaire" (1848). The most popular of his
BG: ballets "Giselle" was written on the plot by 'Theophile Gautier' and
BG: the libretto by Saint-Georges. During the turbulent times in the 19th
BG: century France this exquisite ballet had less publicity than it
BG: deserved and completely passed out of the European repertory. "Giselle"
BG: was revived by 'Sergei Diaghilev' (qv) in 1910. It became the hit of
BG: the season thanks to the lavishly opulent production with the stage
BG: design by 'Alexandre Benois' (qv) and choreography by
BG: 'Mikhail Fokin' (qv) for "Seasons Russes" in Paris. Since it's revival
BG: by 'Sergei Diaghilev' (qv) Giselle was performed by
BG: 'Anna Pavlova (I)' (qv), Tamara Karsavina' , 'Galina Ulanova' (qv),
BG: 'Alicia Markova' (qv), 'Margot Fonteyn' (qv) and
BG: 'Natalia Makarova' (qv). The role of Gizelle is one of the most
BG: sought-after roles in ballet.
BG: 
BG: Adam was elected the Member of Institute. After the death of his father,
BG: Adam was made the professor of composition ar the Paris Conservatory in
BG: 1848. He was the most important force behind the attempt of
BG: establishing a National Theatre in Paris. His effort was motivated by
BG: his idea of a venue for young composers and actors, where they could
BG: show their works to the public. During the turbulent times after the
BG: revolution of 1848 he funded the National Theatre himself. After a few
BG: seasons of financial struggles the National Theatre was closed leaving
BG: Adam in serious debt. Adam died on May 3, 1856 in Paris.
BG: 
BG: His Christmas song "Cantique de Noel" (O, Holy Night), composed in 1850,
BG: became one of the most performed and recorded piece of music.

NM: Adam, Alfred

RN: Alfred Roger ADAM

DB: 4 April 1908, Asnières, Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France, France

DD: 7 May 1982, Le Perreux-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne, France (heart attack)

BG: Tall, but never standing uptight, even looking a bit sloppy; a drowsy
BG: look but with a twinkle of irony in the eye; a grumbling tone but not
BG: without some sympathy underlying; a winning drawling Paris accent;
BG: 
BG: You may have recognized Alfred Adam, the French actor par excellence.
BG: 
BG: Adam could as well be the nasty type as the regular working-class
BG: Parisian, the cuckold as the local Casanova, a general as a chauffeur,
BG: a gangster as a policeman, a peasant or the richest man in the village,
BG: an ordinary butcher as an eccentric. While being always convincing
BG: with, in addition, this Gallic touch that made (and still makes) him a
BG: treat to look at and to listen to.
BG: 
BG: Born in 1908 in Asnières, a North-West suburb of Paris, Alfred Adam
BG: proved multi-talented as of a young age. Besides becoming an actor, he
BG: studied civil engineering, wrote plays (his most famous being 'Sylvie
BG: et le fantôme'), penned film screenplays and dialogs and even the
BG: argument for a Roland Petit ballet. He also showed a life long interest
BG: in reading, sport (boxing, tennis, soccer), good food and friendship.
BG: He was a local figure in Montmartre where he lived, gaily strolling the
BG: streets in his long long coat and his wide wide hat.
BG: 
BG: But acting was his main activity and he did interpret scores of roles,
BG: whether at the theater, for the cinema or television.
BG: 
BG: Trained at the Conservatoire by Louis Jouvet, he worked for him between
BG: 1935 and 1939 before being hired by another great name, Charles Dullin
BG: and becoming a member of the Comédie Française. Ever an open-minded
BG: artist, Alfred Adam never said no to a good light comedy.
BG: 
BG: As far as movies are concerned he debuted in 1935 in Jacques Feyder's
BG: masterpiece 'La kermesse héroïque'. His greatest role is unquestionably
BG: that of Cornudet, the Republican who is the only one to defend a brave
BG: prostitute against self-righteous bourgeois and nobles in
BG: Christian-Jaque's film version of Maupassant's 'Boule de Suif'. He was
BG: also very good as the chauffeur and confidante of Gabin in Verneuil's
BG: memorable 'Le President' and an absolute delight as Maréchal de
BG: Villeroy, that old codger, in Bertrand Tavernier's 'Que la fête
BG: commence'
BG: 
BG: The only regret we can have is that Adam accepted too many roles in
BG: minor pictures. He would have been amazing in pictures by Renoir,
BG: Clouzot, Grémillon or Carné.

RN: Ronald George Hinings Adams

DB: 31 December 1896, Bromyard, England, UK

DD: 27 March 1979, London, England, UK (natural causes)

HT: 6' 1/2"

BG: Ronald Adam was a man who combined an acting career with an
BG: extra-ordinary military career that encompassed being a victim of the
BG: Red Baron in World War One to taking his revenge as an RAF fighter
BG: controller in the Battle of Britain. Born Ronald George Hinings Adams
BG: on the last day of 1896, he was educated at University College, London.
BG: When still only 17 years of age, Adams volunteered to join the British
BG: army on the outbreak of the first world war. On December 2nd 1914, he
BG: was commissioned as a temporary second Lieutenant in the 15th (reserve)
BG: battalion of the Middlesex regiment. He then transferred to the Royal
BG: Flying Corps (RFC) as an observer and then undertook pilot training.
BG: Adams then served with 18 squadron and flew Sopwith Camel's with 44
BG: squadron on home defense duties. He then joined 73 squadron, also
BG: flying Sopwith Camel's in France. On April 7th 1918, he was shot down
BG: near Villers-Brettoneux in northern France. Historians still debate who
BG: shot down Adams, some argue his victor was Ltn Hans Kirchstein, but
BG: many others think that he was the 78th victim of the legendary Baron
BG: 'Manfred von Richthofen' (qv), known to history as "The Red Baron".
BG: Adams was wounded and captured and, on the evening of his aerial
BG: defeat, was visited by a German orderly who gave him Von Richthofen's
BG: compliments. Ronald Adams spent eight months in hospitals and prison
BG: camps before he was re-repatriated on 17th December 1918, the 15th
BG: anniversary of the Wright brothers first powered flight.
BG: 
BG: Post-war Adams trained as a chartered accountant and then moved into
BG: theatre management, running the Embassy Theatre in London. He then
BG: decided to become an actor proper, altering his name slightly to Ronald
BG: Adam. He also wrote books and several of his plays were staged. From
BG: 1936 he began to work in films. On the outbreak of the second world war
BG: Ronald Adam rejoined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and during the Battle of
BG: Britain which raged over England in the summer of 1940 he was the
BG: fighter controller for the Hornchurch sector. No matter how good the
BG: RAF's Spitfire and Hurricanes were, they could not be effective unless
BG: they could intercept the armada of incoming German planes. It was Wing
BG: Commander Ronald Adam's job to co-ordinate the RAF fighter command
BG: interceptions from data gathered by radar and ground observers and then
BG: dispatch fighters to intercept. It was a vital role in one of histories
BG: decisive battles in which the future of western civilization was at
BG: stake. Post war Ronald Adam lived in Surbiton, Surrey and died on 28th
BG: March 1979. He was 83 years of age.

NM: Adam, Vikas

DB: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

BG: Vikas Adam was born in British Columbia and has lived in Vancouver,
BG: Winnipeg, and Bombay before relocating with his family to New York City
BG: where he began studying at National Dance Institute under the tutelage
BG: of dance legend Jacques d'Amboise. At NDI, Adam performed at Lincoln
BG: Center, Battery Park, and Madison Square Garden alongside stars
BG: including Eli Wallach, Judy Collins and Vicki Lewis.
BG: 
BG: With several performances on his resume, Vikas Adam attended Syracuse
BG: University in New York, majoring in Acting & Directing. There, he acted
BG: in several productions including the world premiere of Jean Genet's
BG: lost piece Prison Rites (Le Bagne), The Good Times are Killing Me, and
BG: The Masque of the Red Death. He was also a member of The Broken Compass
BG: Players Improvisation Troupe.
BG: 
BG: Upon receiving his BFA, Adam relocated to Dallas and was first cast in
BG: The Tempest (Ariel). Inspired by his positive reviews, Adam spent the
BG: next several years honing his skills as an actor, director, and
BG: producer. He appeared in more than twenty productions including A
BG: Midsummer Night's Dream (Demetrius), The Last One Nighter on the Death
BG: Trail (The Kid), and Two Gentlemen of Verona (Thurio). Adam also acted
BG: in several independent films including,
BG: _Is Anybody There? (2002)_ (qv), an official selection at the Vistas
BG: Latino Film Festival.
BG: 
BG: During his tenure in Dallas, Vikas Adam founded PXArts and served as the

BG: in a bold production of The Misanthrope (Moliere) leveraging a new
BG: adaptation by London native Neil Bartlett.
BG: 
BG: The production won several awards including Best Play, Best Director and
BG: Best Ensemble. Talkin' Broadway heralded Vikas' performance, stating,
BG: "Adam shows all the hot, seething anger and contempt for the situations
BG: swirling around him with his intense acting craft. In the second act,
BG: he creates even more depth and understanding as his character's arc
BG: reaches its apex with harsh reality, all thanks to Adam's convincing
BG: and vociferous acting."
BG: 
BG: This critical acclaim was a sweet send-off for Vikas Adam, who relocated
BG: to Los Angeles in 2008 to further his acting career and attend the UCLA
BG: School of Theater, Film & Television three-year professional program to
BG: secure his MFA in Acting. While packing his bags in preparation for his

DB: 21 March 1972, Warsaw, Mazowieckie, Poland

HT: 182 cm

BG: Piotr Adamczyk, born 21st of March 1972, in Warsaw.
BG: 
BG: Since his early childhood he knew he wanted to become an actor, and
BG: therefore very quickly he began chasing his dreams. As early as at the
BG: age of 14 he began to interpret leading roles in theatres and films. He
BG: attended the prestigious Machulski youth theatre group in Warsaw.
BG: Thanks to the international scholarship that he was granted, he was
BG: able to cross the Iron Curtain and attend international theatre
BG: workshops in the UK and Germany. He continued his acting education by
BG: attending the Theatre Academy in Warsaw and received his training from
BG: some of the greatest Polish acting legends such as Gustaw Holoubek and
BG: Zbigniew Zapasiewicz. During his second academic year (Poland was now
BG: independent), he won a stipend from the Sorosz Foundation which
BG: permitted him to attend the British American Drama Academy for one
BG: year, where he performed Hamlet at the end of his stay there.
BG: 
BG: Once he graduated from the Theatre Academy, he was hired by one of the
BG: best theatres in Warsaw, the Wspolczesny Theatre, where for 10 years he
BG: climbed the ladder of the Polish theatre world. His career in the film
BG: industry however began much more intensively. His role of Stawrogin in
BG: Dostoyewsky's "The Possessed" starts Piotr's long list of leading
BG: roles. The breakthrough in his career was his part as Frederic Chopin
BG: in the film "Chopin - Desire of Love"- with this role he joined the
BG: club of Polish stars. The climax of his popularity was reached when he
BG: played the title role of another Polish historical figure in a two part
BG: Italian movie- "Karol the Man who became Pope" and "The Pope- the Man".
BG: The movie was viewed by several dozen million viewers, and made him
BG: popular in Italy, Latin America and many other catholic countries.
BG: 
BG: Despite appearances, this was a very difficult moment in Piotr's career
BG: because he became so intensely associated with that role, that there
BG: was fear he wouldn't be able to break free from the association. Piotr
BG: hasn't stopped surprising and even shocking his viewers and
BG: consequently has played diametrically different parts. A ranking
BG: Gestapo officer, a closet gay in the hit "Ladies" and many other box
BG: office hit comedies are a testimony to versatility and comic abilities.
BG: To this day he plays as a guest star at several theatres such as the
BG: National Theatre and the up and coming Imka Theatre in Warsaw. Piotr
BG: also managed to take advantage of his popularity abroad to play at the
BG: Sala Uno Theatre in Rome, in Italian. He also played in Liliana
BG: Cavani's movie "Einstein" and in the Portuguese mega production "Second
BG: Life"
BG: 
BG: He has under his belt over 800 radio roles and around 100 theatre,
BG: television and film parts. He is also appreciated for his dubbing
BG: roles. He is the Polish voice of Ben Stiller, Eddy Murphy, Daniel Day
BG: Lewis and Adam Sandler. In animated films he played among others the
BG: giraffe in "Madagascar", Zigzag McQueen in "Cars" and Syndrome in "The
BG: Incredibles".
BG: 
BG: He has received many prestigious awards in Poland and abroad and he is
BG: most appreciative of awards based on public opinion. In 2011 he was
BG: awarded the most popular Polish actor once again. However he gets most
BG: of his satisfaction from the fact that films in which he plays always
BG: hold top positions at the Polish box office.

BG: Amy Adams was born in Italy to American parents Kathryn and Richard
BG: Adams, while her father was a U.S. serviceman. She was raised in a
BG: Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado.
BG: 
BG: Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an
BG: apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of
BG: becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and
BG: as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer
BG: at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such
BG: productions as "Brigadoon" and "A Chorus Line". It was there that she
BG: was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to
BG: move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work.
BG: 
BG: Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to
BG: audition for a part in _Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)_ (qv), which was
BG: filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, 'Kirstie Alley' (qv)
BG: encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the
BG: Fox television version of the film, _Cruel Intentions (1999)_ (qv), in
BG: the part played in the film by 'Sarah Michelle Gellar' (qv), "Kathryn
BG: Merteuil". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series
BG: never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and
BG: released as the direct-to-video _Cruel Intentions 2 (2000) (V)_ (qv).
BG: After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in
BG: _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv), playing opposite
BG: 'Leonardo DiCaprio' (qv). But this did not provide the break-through
BG: she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year.
BG: She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived
BG: series, _"Dr. Vegas" (2004)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: Her role in the low-budget independent film _Junebug (2005)_ (qv) (which
BG: was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award
BG: nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The
BG: following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated
BG: heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning
BG: for the role of "Giselle" in the animated/live-action feature film,
BG: _Enchanted (2007)_ (qv), which would prove to be her major
BG: break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to

QU: * I have worked with some of the meanest people in the world. You can't do
QU:   anything to intimidate me.
QU: * I think that I've always been attracted to characters who are positive
QU:   and come from a very innocent place. I think there's a lot of room for
QU:   discovery in these characters and that's something I always have fun
QU:   playing.
QU: * It's nerve-wracking! I'll be up there, singing the song in front of
QU:   billions of people - oh, and 'Daniel Day-Lewis' (qv)! And
QU:   'Cate Blanchett' (qv). I'll be going to Taco Bell when the ceremony is
QU:   over. Mexican food cures me (On singing at the Oscars).
QU: * Not at this point. Right now I'm just doing what I enjoy and I've done
QU:   some different films, I've done some different types of roles. (On
QU:   being stereotyped as the 'naive' one.)
QU: * 'Whitney Houston' (qv) came in. Someone dared me to do "the Gap act" on
QU:   her. You know, the Gap act. So I went up to her like I didn't know who
QU:   she was, and I said, 'Hi, I just wanted to let you know about our sale
QU:   items and make sure to check out our new colors'. She looked at me like
QU:   I was crazy (On working at The Gap).
QU: * Thirty was a big deal for me. It was the age where I reevaluated
QU:   everything - how I approached life and how I thought about myself. When
QU:   I look at my 20s, or when I look at any period in my life, I think
QU:   about how much time I've wasted trying to find the right man. It's
QU:   like, if I could go back and do it again, I would have taken guitar
QU:   lessons or something. I would have put my energy into something that
QU:   paid off in the end, instead of trying to improve myself for men. Oh,
QU:   the time and the energy, trying to impress somebody who was actually a
QU:   big jerk, you know? But the truth is, once you have a great man in your
QU:   life, it allows you - or at least for me - to look at yourself and grow
QU:   as an individual. And gosh, if I had known I was going to find this, my
QU:   20s would have been completely different.
QU: * (2011) I was a hostess at Hooters, and that was sort of fun. I was 17,
QU:   and then when I was 18, I waited [tables] for about a month. I wasn't
QU:   cut out to be a waitress, and I certainly wasn't cut out to be a
QU:   Hooters waitress. That was a short-lived ambition. Everyone would
QU:   agree, if they could see me, Hooters isn't necessarily the best way to
QU:   describe me.

BG: The Neighbours" which included the single "(Everything I Do) I Do It

DB: 6 February 1958, Queens, New York, USA

DD: 3 March 2004, Los Angeles, California, USA (lung cancer)

BG: American actress, casting director, teacher, and theatrical director.
BG: The daughter of nightclub singer Adelaide Adams and
BG: _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv) star 'Don Adams (I)' (qv), she was born in
BG: Queens, New York, several months after her parents' divorce. Raised in
BG: peripatetic fashion by her mother, she survived a particularly
BG: Dickensian Catholic boarding school as a toddler, and grew up primarily
BG: in Silver Spring, Maryland. The fourth of her mother's four daughters,
BG: she had a poor upbringing, despite her father's growing fame and
BG: wealth. She was frequently farmed out to friends and extended-family
BG: members while her mother embarked on various ventures. She spent a good
BG: deal of time in Costa Rica with a family friend, and lived for a year
BG: in Italy while her mother attended medical school there. Later, she
BG: spent summers with her father and stepmother (dancer
BG: 'Dorothy Bracken' (qv)) in Beverly Hills and, as a teenager, lived
BG: there with her own mother. She attended Beverly Hills High School with
BG: the children of such stars as 'Robert Cummings (I)' (qv) and
BG: 'Shirley Jones (I)' (qv), and with future stars like
BG: 'Nicolas Cage' (qv). She studied at the University of California,
BG: Irvine, focusing on theatre. Her classmates included future comic star
BG: 'Jon Lovitz' (qv) and television writer-producer 'Nancylee Myatt' (qv).
BG: Following college, she worked as a waitress and as a professional clown
BG: while attempting to break into film and television. Encouraged by her
BG: aunt 'Alice Borden' (qv) and uncle 'Dick Yarmy' (qv), she joined the
BG: prestigious Theatre West company in Hollywood and remained there as an
BG: actor and director for the rest of her life. Even without the
BG: assistance of her father, she managed to break into television in small
BG: roles in the 1980s, while appearing in numerous plays. A chance offer
BG: of an internship with casting director 'Reuben Cannon (I)' (qv) led to
BG: a parallel career as a casting assistant and then associate with
BG: Cannon, 'Carol L. Dudley' (qv), 'Marc Hirschfeld (II)' (qv), and
BG: 'Meg Liberman' (qv). Branching out on her own, she occasionally
BG: partnered with casting directors 'Robert J. Ulrich' (qv) and
BG: 'Eric Dawson (I)' (qv). She cast a number of feature films and
BG: television series. Simultaneously, she maintained her acting career
BG: (although refusing to accept offers or auditions for projects she
BG: herself was casting). She made notable Los Angeles stage appearances,
BG: particularly in 'Nancylee Myatt' (qv)'s "Two On the Aisle For Murder",
BG: Barbara Beery's "Loretta I'm Sorry" and "Pressing Engagements" by actor
BG: 'Jim Beaver (I)' (qv), whom she had married in 1989. A starring role in
BG: _Little Secrets (1991)_ (qv) helped that feature film win a Silver
BG: Medal at the Houston Film Festival. Later, she replaced
BG: 'Andrea Martin (I)' (qv) in what would be her most famous role, that of
BG: the acerbic Ferengi feminist "Ishka" (or "Moogie") on the outer space
BG: series _"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" (1993)_ (qv). At the same time,
BG: she was active in improvisational comedy programs with The Groundlings
BG: and the Acme Comedy Theatre. A brilliantly talented acting coach, she
BG: taught extremely popular courses in audition technique. Despite equal
BG: brilliance as a lyricist (usually with composer partner David Burke),
BG: she preferred to devote her energies to stage and screen performing. In
BG: 2001, her only child was born. Barely two years later, Adams, a
BG: non-smoker and health-advocate, was diagnosed at age 45 with advanced
BG: lung cancer. Hoping to survive to raise her infant daughter, she
BG: accepted a variety of experimental and innovative (though painful)
BG: treatments, but succumbed to the disease only four months after its
BG: discovery. She was cremated and her ashes scattered in Fern Canyon,
BG: Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, California.

BG: Of Irish-Hungarian heritage, New York-born Don Adams had a sister,
BG: Gloria, and a brother, 'Dick Yarmy' (qv). He served in the U.S. Marines
BG: in World War II and contracted malaria during the fighting on
BG: Guadalcanal island. After the war he began a career as a stand-up
BG: comic. He married singer Adelaide Adams and adopted her last name as
BG: his stage surname. They had seven children: Carolyn, Christine,
BG: Catherine, 'Cecily Adams' (qv), 'Stacey Adams (I)' (qv), Sean, Beige.
BG: His television career began when he won the
BG: _"Ted Mack & the Original Amateur Hour" (1948)_ (qv) talent contest.
BG: His most famous role, of course, is as bumbling, incompetent, clueless
BG: yet endearing secret agent Maxwell Smart in the classic sitcom/spy
BG: spoof _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv), although he also had a career as a
BG: television director and a Broadway and theatrical dramatic actor.

BY: A. Nonymous

BG: American comic actor and comedian who gained worldwide fame and three
BG: Emmy Awards starring as Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, in the classic
BG: television comedy _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: Born Donald James Yarmy on April 13, 1923 [correct, despite frequently
BG: reported erroneous dates] in New York City to Irish-Hungarian parents,
BG: Adams prepared for a career as a commercial artist. He joined the U.S.
BG: Marines in the early days of World War II. He saw combat in the
BG: invasion of Guadalcanal and was the only survivor of his platoon. He
BG: contracted blackwater fever and nearly died, remaining hospitalized for
BG: more than a year. After his recovery he served as a drill instructor.
BG: 
BG: Following the war, he embarked on a career as an impressionist and
BG: stand-up comedian, appearing in small clubs in Florida and Washington
BG: D.C. He married singer Adelaide Adams and took her professional last
BG: name as his own stage name. In 1954, his stand-up act, written with his
BG: boyhood friend 'Bill Dana' (qv), landed him a contestant spot on Arthur
BG: Godfrey's _"Talent Scouts" (1948)_ (qv), which he won. This led to
BG: scores of appearances on comedy and variety series such as
BG: _"The Steve Allen Show" (1956)_ (qv) and Ed Sullivan's
BG: _"Toast of the Town" (1948)_ (qv), and ultimately to a regular job on
BG: _"The Perry Como Show" (1948)_ (qv). He also played in stock and in
BG: 1962 starred with 'Anthony Perkins (I)' (qv) in the Broadway play
BG: "Harold".
BG: 
BG: Divorced and remarried (to dancer 'Dorothy Bracken' (qv) ), Adams in
BG: 1963 reunited with 'Bill Dana' (qv) on
BG: _"The Bill Dana Show" (1963)_ (qv), playing inept hotel detective Byron
BG: Glick, a forerunner to his most famous characterization. NBC placed
BG: Adams under contract and gave him the starring role in the
BG: 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) and 'Buck Henry' (qv) spy spoof
BG: _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv). As the bumbling yet intrepid secret agent
BG: Maxwell Smart, Adams was an instant success. With his alluring
BG: straight-woman partner Agent 99 ('Barbara Feldon' (qv)), Adams became a
BG: comic icon of the 1960s, popularizing dozens of catch-phrases that
BG: still resound today: "Would you believe?", "Missed it by THAT much!",
BG: "...and LOVING it!" and "Sorry about that, Chief."
BG: 
BG: Adams reveled in the show and its popularity, and particularly enjoyed
BG: writing and directing several episodes. _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv) ran
BG: for five seasons and brought Adams wealth, awards, and worldwide fame.
BG: At the same time, he continued to achieve recognition as one of the
BG: funniest and most popular stand-up comedians of his generation.
BG: 
BG: Adams returned in a new series in 1971, _"The Partners" (1971)_ (qv),
BG: which, though slightly more serious than Get Smart, still had him
BG: playing a bumbling law-enforcement officer. This time he starred with
BG: 'Rupert Crosse' (qv), the two playing a pair of none-too-bright
BG: detectives. The show lasted one season. Except for the intriguing but
BG: unsuccessful _"Don Adams' Screen Test" (1975)_ (qv) (a contest show in
BG: which Adams directed famous stars and amateurs in scenes from classic
BG: movies), he did not return to series television for fourteen years.
BG: 
BG: Instead he guest-starred on sitcoms, variety shows, and occasional TV
BG: movies. He played Las Vegas showrooms and nightclubs, though he grew
BG: increasingly reluctant to perform before live audiences. With the
BG: distinctive voice of his on-screen persona, he had long been active in
BG: voice-over work. Even during the Get Smart period he had been popular
BG: among children as the title voice of the animated
BG: _"Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales" (1963)_ (qv), and later was even more
BG: popular in his title role as _"Inspector Gadget" (1983)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: Divorced again, he married a third time in 1977 (to
BG: 'Judy Luciano' (qv)). During this period, Adams starred in and directed
BG: a number of commercials, winning a CLIO Award for directing. In 1980,
BG: he reluctantly returned to the Maxwell Smart character in a feature
BG: film, _The Nude Bomb (1980)_ (qv), which he hated. He also brought the
BG: character briefly back to television in the 1989 TV movie
BG: _Get Smart, Again! (1989) (TV)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: In 1985, he returned to series television in a Canadian sitcom,
BG: _"Check It Out" (1985)_ (qv), in which he played the manager of a
BG: supermarket. The show was popular enough to run for three seasons on
BG: American TV, but it mainly provided a paycheck for Adams and a
BG: co-starring role for a pre-_"NYPD Blue" (1993)_ (qv)
BG: 'Gordon Clapp (I)' (qv).
BG: 
BG: In later years, he hoped for a chance at serious roles, of which he had
BG: done many in his early years in summer stock. But the opportunity never
BG: arrived. A role was actually written for him by his son-in-law
BG: 'Jim Beaver (I)' (qv) for the revived
BG: _"Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1985)_ (qv) in 1986, but the producers
BG: feared he could not subsume his comedic persona, and the role went to
BG: 'Martin Landau' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Instead, he returned to the role that had made him world famous, in a
BG: third revival of Maxwell Smart. The 1995 series version of
BG: _"Get Smart" (1995)_ (qv) featured Adams as Smart, now promoted to
BG: Chief of the secret agency CONTROL. 'Barbara Feldon' (qv) also returned
BG: as his wife and colleague, but instead of the couple who had made
BG: television history, the show focused on the bumbling spy efforts of
BG: their son Zach Smart. Only seven episodes aired before the new show was
BG: cancelled.
BG: 
BG: Adams spent the remainder of his career doing commercials and voice
BG: work, mostly in new Inspector Gadget productions. In 1999, he made a
BG: cameo voice appearance in the live-action
BG: _Inspector Gadget (1999)_ (qv) feature film starring
BG: 'Matthew Broderick (I)' (qv) as Gadget.
BG: 
BG: Like his brother, the late comic actor 'Dick Yarmy' (qv), Adams was an
BG: inveterate horse-player. His leisure time was largely spent either at
BG: racetracks or in card games at the Playboy Mansion, and with pals such
BG: as 'Hugh M. Hefner' (qv), 'James Caan (I)' (qv), and
BG: 'Don Rickles' (qv). Divorced for the third time, he lived alone in a
BG: luxury apartment in Century City. He was a devoted history buff, and
BG: was an amateur expert on the lives of Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler.
BG: He was a talented poet and painter.
BG: 
BG: His health declined in later years with the onset of bone lymphoma, but
BG: took a precipitous turn for the worse following the death in 2004 of
BG: his daughter, actress-casting director 'Cecily Adams' (qv). He died
BG: from a lung infection at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Hills
BG: on September 25, 2005. Two of his former wives and three of his
BG: children, as well as other family members, were with him when he died.

TR:   fluke, he auditioned and became a winner on 'Arthur Godfrey' (qv)'s
TR:   _"Talent Scouts" (1948)_ (qv). This led to TV appearances with
TR:   'Steve Allen (I)' (qv) and 'Ed Sullivan (I)' (qv), among others, and
TR:   stardom.
TR: * Instead of taking a large paycheck per episode ($12,500 per week) of
TR:   _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv), Adams decided to take a smaller salary and
TR:   33% share. It paid off in spades--the show has been running in
TR:   syndication for decades.
TR: * His clipped Maxwell Smart voice came from a much exaggerated takeoff on
TR:   'William Powell (I)' (qv)'s "The Thin Man." He used to get laughs using
TR:   the exact same voice years earlier on the stand-up circuit in different
TR:   character set pieces - a baseball umpire, a football coach, a defense
TR:   attorney.
TR: * As the inept Agent 86 on _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv) Adams used to have a
TR:   script assistant read his part to him once or twice just before a
TR:   scene, instead of learning his lines.
TR: * Uninterested in doing the James Bond spoof _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv)
TR:   series at first, he got on board after learning that
TR:   'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) and 'Buck Henry' (qv) were involved with the
TR:   pilot script. 'Tom Poston' (qv) was the first name being considered for
TR:   the role, but Adams, under contract to NBC at the time, was promoted
TR:   for the job by the network.
TR: * Won three Emmys for bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart in
TR:   _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv) and the show itself won two awards for "Best
TR:   Comedy," but he was severely typecast after this and never did find
TR:   another proper showcase to display his comic range.
TR: * One of the first (if not the first) stand up comedian to have his own
TR:   sitcom.
TR: * Did not like the (badly timed) laugh track in _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv).
TR: * Buried at the beautifully restored Hollywood Forever Cemetery located at
TR:   6000 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, California, USA. Plot 8, Northeast
TR:   pond.
TR: * Shares birthday with 'Ron Perlman' (qv).
TR: * In 1984, played as himself in Miller Lite Beer commercials, poking fun
TR:   at his Maxwell Smart fame.
TR: * His Agent 86 catchphrase, "Would you believe...?", became the slogan for
TR:   commercials for the White Castle hamburger chain in 1992, in which he
TR:   also acted.
TR: * His two best known roles -- Maxwell Smart and Inspector Gadget -- were
TR:   both James Bond parodies. _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv) parodied the secret
TR:   agent stories, while Inspector Gadget featured the unseen villain The
TR:   Claw, who is shown as an arm stroking his cat, an obvious reference to
TR:   Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
TR: * One of his duties while serving in the Marine Corps was a drill
TR:   instructor.
TR: * Best remembered by the public for his starring role as "Maxwell
TR:   Smart/Agent 86" on _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv).
TR: * Was in a comedy team called The Young Brothers with
TR:   'Jay Lawrence (I)' (qv).
TR: * Was only 2 inches shorter than ex-_"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv) co-star,
TR:   'Barbara Feldon' (qv). In order for make it appear that Adams was
TR:   taller than her, he'd either stand on a small platform or Feldon would
TR:   stoop down.
TR: * According to former _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv), co-star,
TR:   'Barbara Feldon' (qv), Adams had an amazing memory that allowed him to
TR:   take an unusual approach to filming.
TR: * Was good friends with 'Don Rickles' (qv), 'Bernie Kopell' (qv),
TR:   'James Caan (I)' (qv) and 'Hugh M. Hefner' (qv).
TR: * Daughter 'Cecily Adams' (qv) died in 2004, and son 'Sean Adams (I)' (qv)
TR:   died in 2006.
TR: * When the pilot of _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv) was shooting for CBS, the
TR:   producers wanted 'Tom Poston' (qv) for the role of Maxwell Smart, but
TR:   when they sold it to NBC, Adams was already under contract with the
TR:   network, hence, he was immediately cast in the role.
TR: * Before he was a comedian/actor, he worked as a theater usher.
TR: * Dropped out from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1941 (which was his
TR:   senior year).
TR: * Remained good friends with 'Barbara Feldon' (qv) during and after
TR:   _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv).
TR: * Older brother of 'Dick Yarmy' (qv).
TR: * Brother-in-law of 'Alice Borden' (qv).

QU: * [interview with Robert DeRossi, 10/27/65] I don't want to change the
QU:   thinking of the world. My purpose is to make people laugh . . . It
QU:   would be hypocritical if I said I don't want recognition, but I've
QU:   never wanted it terribly. I think I'm being honest when I say I'd
QU:   rather turn my talents, whatever they are, to writing and directing.
QU: * In restaurants, [people] send over shoes. I'm so tired of it. I keep
QU:   getting shoes.
QU: * I hate performing. I don't care about being thought funny; I never did.
QU:   Sometimes I wonder how I got into comedy at all. I did movie star
QU:   impressions as a kid in high school. Somehow they just got out of hand.
QU: * [on _"Get Smart" (1965)_ (qv)] The first few episodes I saw angered me
QU:   so much I felt like throwing the TV through a window. I couldn't stand
QU:   the laugh track... I didn't think so when I was making them, but some
QU:   of those episodes are funny, funny shows. Some are classics. I actually
QU:   laugh out loud at them now.
QU: * I'm no longer independently wealthy. I guess it's the result of too many
QU:   wives, too many kids and too much alimony. I've been paying alimony
QU:   since I was 14 and child support since 15. That's a joke, but not by
QU:   much.
QU: * I like getting married, but I don't like being married.
QU: * [on his trademark clipped voice] It was Bill ('Bill Dana' (qv)) who was
QU:   primarily responsible for me using that voice. Right from the
QU:   beginning, he said, 'You should do all your routines in that voice.'
QU:   And I said, 'But I can't stand that voice.' And he said, 'But it's
QU:   funny. It makes people laugh.' And I'm, like, 'But I hate it...' For
QU:   whatever reason, the delivery or whatever it is, that voice makes any
QU:   situation funnier.
QU: * [on 'Jim Carrey' (qv)] I'm not turned on by a comedian who bends over,
QU:   spreads his cheeks and speaks out of his rear end.
QU: * I watched _"Seinfeld" (1990)_ (qv) and didn't know what the show was
QU:   about. It was about nothing!
QU: * [on _"Get Smart" (1995)_ (qv) and 'Andy Dick (I)' (qv)] I knew it
QU:   wouldn't work but they offered me a lot of money. I knew after the
QU:   pilot that this kid couldn't carry the show.

HT: 6' 5"

BG: Born Douglas Noel Adams on March 11, 1952 in Cambridge. From 1959 until
BG: 1970 he went to Brentwood school in Essex, and his main interest was
BG: science. As a student in Cambridge he decided to hitch-hike through
BG: Europe to Istanbul, and in order to raise funds for this he took a lot
BG: of small jobs. In 1970 he left school to become a writer, certain that
BG: success was just around the corner. But nothing happened. He worked
BG: with the late Monty Python member 'Graham Chapman' (qv) and
BG: 'John Lloyd (I)' (qv), but hardly anything they did was published.
BG: 
BG: On February 4 1977 he met 'Simon Brett' (qv), who then was doing Radio
BG: 4's 'The Burkiss Way'. They agreed to produce a science fiction comedy
BG: show on radio. This was the birth of the Hitch-hikers Guide to the
BG: Galaxy.
BG: 
BG: Douglas Adams married Jane Belson on November 24 1991 and they have a
BG: daughter by the name Polly Jane, born on June 22, 1994. They lived in
BG: Islington, but in 1999 they moved to California, USA. In 1997 Douglas
BG: signed a deal with Disney to make a feature movie, and he immediately
BG: started working on the screenplay. 'Jay Roach' (qv), of Austin Powers
BG: fame, was signed as director.
BG: 
BG: On the morning of May 11 2001, Adams went to the local gym to work out.
BG: There he suffered a massive heart attack and all attempts to revive him
BG: were unsuccessful. He died, and left his 6 year old daughter Polly, his
BG: wife Jane, his mother Jan Thrift, brother James and countless other
BG: family members and friends, not to mention thousands and thousands of
BG: fans all over the world, in shock and mourning.
BG: 
BG: Author of the hysterically funny series of books, summarized as
BG: "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", which also include a radio series,
BG: a TV series, stage play, record albums, computer game, graphic novels
BG: and a bath towel.
BG: 
BG: He also wrote the Dirk Gently novels and a non fiction book, "Last
BG: Chance to See", about endangered species. Apart from being a writer, he
BG: was also a chicken shed cleaner, bodyguard for an Arab royal family and
BG: he actually at one time played guitar for Pink Floyd (42nd birthday
BG: gift from 'David Gilmour (I)' (qv), an old friend).
BG: 
BG: Douglas co-founded the company The Digital Village (now h2g2), producing
BG: nearly everything that has to do with media: TV, movies, computer games
BG: etc. He was one of the creators of Starship Titanic, a combined book
BG: (co-written with 'Terry Jones (I)' (qv) of the Monty Python bunch) and
BG: computer game.
BG: 
BG: It was often claimed that 'P.G. Wodehouse' (qv) had influence on him and
BG: his work, and when once asked about this he replied: "Yes, a huge
BG: impact. But not an early impact. I didn't start reading Wodehouse until
BG: I was writing 'Restaurant at the end of the universe'. I can see the
BG: impact starting almost immediately. I think that Wodehouse, without
BG: exaggeration, was a genius on the English language."

TR: * Studied English Literature at Cambridge University. While at university,
TR:   he was a member of the prestigious Cambridge University Footlights
TR:   Club.
TR: * One daughter, 'Polly Jane Rocket Adams' (qv).
TR: * Claimed to have the initial idea for his work,
TR:   _"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy" (1981)_ (qv), while lying drunk
TR:   in a field holding a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to Europe.
TR: * Was working on having a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy film produced
TR:   at the time of his death.
TR: * Died of an apparent heart attack on 11 May 2001; collapsed while working
TR:   out in a gym.
TR: * The day before his death (10th May 2001) the Minor Planet Centre of the
TR:   International Astronomical Union named asteroid 18610 "Arthurdent",
TR:   after the character Arthur Dent in
TR:   _"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy" (1981)_ (qv).
TR: * Was left-handed and had a large collection of left-handed guitars.
TR: * Helped 'Keith Allen (I)' (qv) with his piano lessons.
TR: * At the request of 'David Gilmour (I)' (qv), he helped come up with a
TR:   name for a new 'Pink Floyd' (qv) album ("The Division Bell"). In
TR:   exchange, 'David Gilmour (I)' (qv) contributed £5000 to a charity of
TR:   Adams' choice.
TR: * Stated once that he always found it difficult to write for female
TR:   characters.
TR: * The on-line translator Babelfish is named after the Babelfish that Adams
TR:   wrote of in his novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In "The
TR:   Hitchhiker's Guide..." the Babelfish was a tiny fish that one puts in
TR:   one's ear and then any of the galaxy's myriad languages they hear is
TR:   automatically translated and heard in their native language. The
TR:   instant messaging software Trillian is named after the lead female
TR:   character in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
TR: * In September 2004, new "Tertiary Phase" episodes of "The Hitch Hikers
TR:   Guide to the Galaxy" BBC Radio 4 series debuted. Prior to his death,
TR:   Adams had begun work with 'Dirk Maggs' (qv) on adapting books 3-5 of
TR:   the "trilogy" for radio. Maggs has taken on the mantle of finishing the
TR:   writing (based on Adams' extensive notes) and directing the episodes.
TR:   Phase 4 ("Quandary") began airing in May 2005, with phase 5
TR:   ("Quintessential") to follow.
TR: * The online site H2G2.com was created at his suggestion. The site is a
TR:   web-based pseudo-encyclopedia, inspired by the style of Adams'
TR:   fictional Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (hence, HHGG, or H2G2). The
TR:   site was one of the first "reference" web sites maintained by
TR:   contributions from the public at large.
TR: * Was an early pioneer in the personal computer explosion of the 1980s and
TR:   90s. For example, he owned the first two Apple Macintosh computers sold
TR:   in the UK; was heavily involved in the development of first-person
TR:   computer games (such as the computer version of "The Hitch Hiker's
TR:   Guide To The Galaxy", "Bureaucracy" and "Starship Titanic"); and was an
TR:   early adopter of the Internet. For several years, he was actively
TR:   involved in the Internet newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and would
TR:   often personally answer messages in that forum. However, as the
TR:   Internet became more popular, the questions became more and more
TR:   repetitions of the same (or were offensive and/or insulting), and his
TR:   personal responses became rare.
TR: * Adams used to shower with the hot water running, and stay there until he
TR:   had come up with an idea. His water bill was extremely high.
TR: * A founding member of the team that launched Comic Relief.
TR: * _"Doctor Who" (1963) {City of Death: Part 1 (#17.5)}_ (qv), the
TR:   _"Doctor Who" (1963)_ (qv) story he co-wrote with
TR:   'Graham Williams (IV)' (qv) under the pseudonym of David Agnew, is
TR:   regarded by many fans as one of the best stories in the series' entire
TR:   run. It was voted the seventh greatest story in a
TR:   _"Doctor Who" (1963)_ (qv) Magazine poll in 1998 and the fifth greatest
TR:   _"Doctor Who" (1963)_ (qv) story in fan site Outpost Gallifrey's 40th
TR:   Anniversary Poll.
TR: * When he died, his Internet site was flooded by condolence messages, a
TR:   big amount of whose simply read "So long and thanks for all the fish",
TR:   one of the catchphrases from the Hitchhiker's Guide. The same sentence
TR:   is also his gravestone epitaph.
TR: * During a lecture 'Neil Gaiman' (qv) told that when he was a guest in
TR:   Adams' house, he asked "Where are the towels?" and Adams answered "I
TR:   don't know". Half of the audience sniggered at that, and Gaiman said,
TR:   "Many of you don't know why it's funny that Adams didn't know where his
TR:   towels were. Too bad." It was a reference to the towels running joke in
TR:   Hitchhiker's Guide.
TR: * He was proud that his initials spelled DNA and used to point it out.

QU: * [on BBC Online chat, 11/8/00] I'm 48, which is a bit of a shock to me.
QU:   Why only last year I thought I was a precocious young thing!
QU: * [11/8/00] I think that growing up in a crowded continent like Europe
QU:   with an awful lot of competing claims, ideas . . . cultures . . . and
QU:   systems of thought we have, perforce, developed a more sophisticated
QU:   notion of what the word freedom means than I see much evidence of in
QU:   America. To be frank, it sometimes seems that the American idea of
QU:   freedom has more to do with my freedom to do what I want than your
QU:   freedom to do what you want. I think that in Europe we're probably
QU:   better at understanding how to balance those competing claims, though
QU:   not a lot.
QU: * I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.
QU: * [agreeing that _Starship Titanic (1998) (VG)_ (qv) should be delayed
QU:   rather than released incomplete] We should nail our colors to the mast
QU:   of quality.
QU: * I loved _"Monty Python's Flying Circus" (1969)_ (qv). For years I wanted
QU:   to be 'John Cleese' (qv), I was most disapointed when I found out the
QU:   job had been taken.
QU: * When it comes down to it, my principle is this - Arthur should be
QU:   British. The rest of the cast should be decided purely on merit and not
QU:   on nationality.
QU: * A danger one runs is that the moment you have anything in the script
QU:   that's clearly meant to be funny in some way, everybody thinks 'oh well
QU:   we can do silly voices and silly walks and so on', and I think that's
QU:   exactly the wrong way to do it.
QU: * Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no
QU:   account be allowed to do the job.
QU: * Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from
QU:   the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent
QU:   disinclination to do so.
QU: * Even he, to whom most things that most people would think were pretty
QU:   smart were pretty dumb, thought it was pretty smart.
QU: * Cyberspace is - or can be - a good, friendly and egalitarian place to
QU:   meet.
QU: * I find the whole business of religion profoundly interesting. But it
QU:   does mystify me that otherwise intelligent people take it seriously.
QU: * There is a particular disdain with which Siamese cats regard you. Anyone
QU:   who has walked in on the Queen cleaning her teeth will be familiar with
QU:   the feeling.
QU: * We notice things that don't work. We don't notice things that do. We
QU:   notice computers, we don't notice pennies. We notice e-book readers, we
QU:   don't notice books.
QU: * I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to
QU:   technologies: 1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is
QU:   normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world
QU:   works. 2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and
QU:   thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably
QU:   get a career in it. 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is
QU:   against the natural order of things.
QU: * One of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you
QU:   get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it
QU:   to them: It is a well known fact, that those people who most want to
QU:   rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. Anyone who is
QU:   capable of getting themselves into a position of power should on no
QU:   account be allowed to do the job. Another problem with governing people
QU:   is people.
QU: * Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to
QU:   point B very fast while other people dash form point B to point A very
QU:   fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are
QU:   often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people
QU:   from point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point
QU:   B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often
QU:   wish that people would just once and for all decide where the hell they
QU:   wanted to be.
QU: * There are two things in particular that it [the computer industry]
QU:   failed to foresee: one was the coming of the Internet . . . the other
QU:   was the fact that the century would end.
QU: * Having been an English literary graduate, I've been trying to avoid the
QU:   idea of doing art ever since. I think the idea of art kills creativity.
QU:   I think media are at their most interesting before anybody's thought of
QU:   calling them art, when people still think they're just a load of junk.
QU: * See first, think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you
QU:   will only see what you were expecting. Most scientists forget that.
QU: * The big corporations are suddenly taking notice of the web, and their
QU:   reactions have been slow. Even the computer industry failed to see the
QU:   importance of the Internet, but that's not saying much. Let's face it,
QU:   the computer industry failed to see that the century would end.
QU: * I think that _"Doctor Who" (1963)_ (qv) is at its best when the humour
QU:   and the drama work together and that however absurd a situation may be,
QU:   it is actually very, very real and it has very real consequences.
QU:   That's the moment at which something that's inherently absurd actually
QU:   becomes frightening.

BG: The scintillating, sultry-eyed blonde (formerly a redhead) star of
BG: screen, TV and award-winning stage went on to become best known,
BG: however, for her sensual delivery pitching cigars in taunting 60s ads
BG: and commercials with her 'Mae West (I)' (qv)ian come-on line, "Why
BG: don't you pick one up and smoke it sometime?" This, of course, was at a
BG: time when smoking was considered quite sexy and fashionable, and Edie
BG: Adams went above and beyond the call of duty in making these ads
BG: legendary.
BG: 
BG: Edie had her hand dipped in all pools of entertainment -- she was a
BG: singing siren, an award-winning Broadway musical entertainer, a deft
BG: impressionist and comedienne, a serious dramatic actress, a commercial
BG: saleswoman and a viable TV celebrity. Off-stage, she showed remarkable
BG: poise and resourcefulness, when her famous first husband, landmark TV
BG: comic 'Ernie Kovacs (I)' (qv), was tragically killed in a January 1962
BG: car crash in Los Angeles and she found her family finances in dire
BG: straits.
BG: 
BG: She was born Edith Elizabeth Enke on April 16, 1927, in the relatively
BG: small town of Kingston, Pennsylvania, but moved while fairly young to
BG: Grove City. Her family relocated again, this time to Tenafly, New
BG: Jersey, where she grew up. Following her graduation from high school,
BG: Edie aspired to become an opera singer and studied voice and piano at
BG: New York's Juilliard School of Music. She then went on to take acting
BG: classes at the Columbia School of Drama.
BG: 
BG: Her theatrical debut occurred with a 1947 production of "Blithe Spirit"
BG: and, a year later, she appeared in the stage show "Goodnight Ladies".
BG: Gradually building up her singing reputation via the nightclub circuit,
BG: her big break came when 'Arthur Godfrey' (qv) booked her on his "Talent
BG: Scouts" show. She didn't come out the winner, but a TV director who
BG: caught sight of her performance visioned in her a seductive "straight
BG: man" who could mesh well with a certain zany comedian. In 1951, Edie
BG: (then known as Edith Adams) was signed up as a featured singer on
BG: 'Ernie Kovacs (I)' (qv)'s comedy show that originated in Philadelphia.
BG: The show, live and unrehearsed, became an innovative, groundbreaking
BG: effort in the relatively new medium. Outrageous and even
BG: incomprehensible at times, his comedy was deemed way ahead of its time,
BG: and, as a result, had problems reaching mainstream audiences who didn't
BG: "get it", and the programs were short-lived. Various Kovacs' platforms
BG: that included Edie were _"Ernie in Kovacsland" (1951)_ (qv), "Kovacs on
BG: the Korner" (1952), and, of course,
BG: _"The Ernie Kovacs Show" (1952)_ (qv). She and Kovacs eloped to Mexico
BG: City in 1954 and their union produced a daughter, 'Mia Kovacs' (qv).
BG: The duo were a popular couple in the Hollywood social circuit (moving
BG: there from New York in the late 50s) and the connections she developed
BG: out there were quite valuable in furthering her career.
BG: 
BG: Early 50s TV opened many doors for Edie and she waltzed right through
BG: them. Her New York stage debut in the popular musical "Wonderful Town"
BG: in 1952 had her walking away with the Theatre World Award for "Best
BG: Newcomer". A few years later, she slithered away with a supporting Tony
BG: Award for her bodacious take on the "Daisy Mae" character in the
BG: musical "Li'l Abner" (1956). Following that were more musical and
BG: dramatic ventures on the stage including "The Merry Widow" (1957), a
BG: show she would return to more than once, "Sweet Bird of Youth" (1960)
BG: and "Free as a Bird" (1960). On film, Edie showed the public that she
BG: wasn't just a pretty face with her sharply unsympathetic supporting
BG: perf in 'Billy Wilder' (qv)'s _The Apartment (1960)_ (qv) and a funny,
BG: sexier one in the second of 'Rock Hudson' (qv) and
BG: 'Doris Day (I)' (qv)'s three battle-of-the-sex romps,
BG: _Lover Come Back (1961)_ (qv). Surprisingly, Edie and Ernie never
BG: appeared together in a film. Edie remained primarily a TV fixture and,
BG: outside of her Emmy-nominated coupling with Kovacs, winningly played
BG: the Fairy Godmother in 'Julie Andrews (I)' (qv)' popular TV version of
BG: _Cinderella (1957) (TV)_ (qv), appeared regularly with
BG: 'Jack Paar (I)' (qv) and 'Dinah Shore' (qv) in their respective variety
BG: shows, acted on various prime-time shows, and graced a number of
BG: celebrity game and talk show panels.
BG: 
BG: One of Edie's last pairings with Kovacs was in 1960 when they appeared
BG: as guests on the very last episode of
BG: _"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour" (1957)_ (qv). The pair appeared as
BG: themselves with one of the highlights having Edie crooning the lovely
BG: ballad "That's All". Kovacs' sudden 1962 death was a terrible reversal
BG: of fortunes for Edie. An inveterate gambler, he left her owing much
BG: money to the IRS. Instead of filing bankruptcy, however, she worked her
BG: way out of debt. In the process, her career received a second wind.
BG: Perhaps it didn't hurt that the public adored Edie and that she was a
BG: genuinely sympathetic figure in the wake of her private tragedy.
BG: 
BG: She returned to the nightclub circuit from whence she came, recorded
BG: albums, and also toured the country in various dramatic and musical
BG: comedy vehicles including "Rain" (as Sadie Thompson), "Bell's Are
BG: Ringing", "Annie Get Your Gun" (as Annie Oakley), "I Do! I Do!",
BG: "Anything Goes" and "Bus Stop". She also received outstanding notices
BG: in a few of her films, whether it be drama
BG: (_Love with the Proper Stranger (1963)_ (qv),
BG: _The Best Man (1964)_ (qv)) or frivolous comedy
BG: (_Call Me Bwana (1963)_ (qv),
BG: _It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963)_ (qv),
BG: _Under the Yum Yum Tree (1963)_ (qv), _The Honey Pot (1967)_ (qv)).
BG: Moreover, she was handed her own musical variety show
BG: _"Here's Edie" (1962)_ (qv) (aka "The Edie Adams Show") and received a
BG: couple of Emmy nominations for her efforts. She also took advantage of
BG: her famous impressions of 'Zsa Zsa Gabor' (qv) and others, appearing on
BG: various TV comedy formats.
BG: 
BG: More than anything, however, it was her come-hither temptress pitching
BG: Muriel cigars that had TV audiences's tongues wagging. It was a
BG: smashingly successful and highly profitable coup for Edie
BG: professionally. Her late husband, a notorious cigar smoker, at one time
BG: sold Dutch Master cigars on TV. The idea then for Edie to pitch a
BG: competing slimmer cigar on TV was only natural. She had much to do with
BG: the direction of the commercials, which ran throughout the 1960s,
BG: providing them with a perfect blend of class, glamour and sensuality.
BG: 
BG: While growing noticeably heavier in later years, she never lost her
BG: trademark humor and sex appeal. Edie could still be seen from time to
BG: time on the stage in such shows as "The Best Little Whorehouse in
BG: Texas", the female version of "The Odd Couple", "Hello, Dolly!" and
BG: "Nunsense". She remained committed to the end to restoring/preserving
BG: her late husband's videotapes and kinescopes of his ground-breaking 50s
BG: TV work. She also recalled her offbeat life with Kovacs in the book
BG: "Sing a Pretty Song", which was published in 1990.
BG: 
BG: Edie remarried in 1964 to photographer Marty Mills, with whom she had a
BG: son, 'Josh Mills (I)' (qv). That union ended in divorce in 1971. The
BG: following year, Edie married jazz trumpeter 'Pete Candoli' (qv). She
BG: and Candoli, who died in January of 2008, divorced in 1989. In another
BG: eerie, tragic circumstance, daughter 'Mia Kovacs' (qv) was killed in a
BG: 1982 Los Angeles auto accident at age 22 -- exactly 20 years after her
BG: father's similar demise. Suffering from cancer and losing weight in
BG: recent years, the beloved Edie died of complications from pneumonia at
BG: age 81 in Los Angeles.

HT: 5' 4"

BG: Enid-Raye Adams was born in 1973 in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. Since
BG: then, no one has ever pronounced her name correctly. Kids at school
BG: called her Igor and Enid The Peenid. After two perms in a row in junior
BG: high, she bore a striking resemblance to Napoleon Dynamite. Enid-Raye
BG: began her theater career in some of Shakespeare's classics: Juliet in
BG: "Romeo and Juliet", Olivia in "Twelfth Night", Lady Percy in "Henry IV,
BG: Part One" and several others. Her film debut was opposite Russell Crowe
BG: in the Canadian independent "For The Moment". In 1998, she moved to
BG: Vancouver to pursue her career and couldn't get arrested. She couldn't
BG: even get a ticket for j-walking. If she j-walked in front of the cops,
BG: they would just say, "I'm sorry, we've decided to go another way," or
BG: "We're too busy giving tickets to actors who already have agents." It
BG: was during this time that she co-wrote and performed in the hilarious
BG: one-woman show "Would You Like Fries With That?", a hit in theaters
BG: across Canada. She also began doing stand-up comedy and finally
BG: threatened to egg an agent's '87 Dodge Dart if he didn't sign her.
BG: Remarkably, he did and she has been working ever since. Enid-Raye has
BG: had roles in Steven Spielberg's "Taken", Showtime's "Jeremiah" and the
BG: acclaimed "Da Vinci's Inquest" for which she received a Leo Award
BG: nomination. Enid-Raye is now preparing to direct and star in her first
BG: film. She continues to eat carbs and does stand-up for her cactus
BG: plant, Eunice, on Wednesday mornings. Baddumchik.

BG: Fay Glen Adams was born in Diaz, Chihuahua, Mexico to William Adams and
BG: Domer Jones Adams. He was the sixth of 11 children. His mother died
BG: giving birth to a stillborn on July 1, 1912. After being notified of
BG: the mother's death, her daughter, Edith, and a family friend drove from
BG: Columbus, New Mexico, to be with the family and attend the funeral.
BG: Being in a hurry, they neglected to take care of all the paperwork at
BG: that time required to enter Mexico and were approached by seven federal
BG: soldiers after arriving at the family home in Diaz, where mother Domer
BG: Adams body was awaiting burial.
BG: 
BG: The federales demanded the immediate departure of Edith and her friend.
BG: Her father asked for an extra day so the full family could be present
BG: at the burial. The soldiers got angry and drew their weapons and, as
BG: Edith jumped in front of her father, one of them fired a shot. The
BG: bullet went just over Edith's head and entered the neck of Will Adams,
BG: killing him instantly. Both of them were buried the next day.

BG: Fourteen-year-old Fay, as well as the other children who were of working
BG: age, were left to take care of themselves and their younger siblings

BG: the September 11th accident, and a day or so before his death he
BG: developed double pneumonia and died at just about midnight in the St.

BG: midnight, was dated September 16. Funeral services were held at the

NM: Adams, Jimmie (I)

RN: Adams, James B.

DB: 4 October 1888, Paterson, New Jersey, USA

DD: 19 December 1933, Glendale, California, USA (heart attack)

BG: Born c. 1888. A slight, short, slapstick comedian who starred in
BG: two-reel comedies for Mermaid, Educational, and Christie Film Company
BG: in the 1920's. Died in 1933 at age 45 in Glendale, California.
BG: 
BG: In 1921 Adams starred in two-reel comedies for Educational Pictures and
BG: Al Christie. The slightly built, pencil-mustached Adams has been
BG: described by historian Kalton C. Lahue as "a poor man's Charley Chase."
BG: Like Chase, and unlike the other comics at Educational, Adams favored
BG: situation comedy over slapstick.
BG: 
BG: He briefly replaced Mack Sennett comic Harry McCoy in the
BG: cartoon-inspired Hall Room Boys series (produced by Harry Cohn and Jack
BG: Cohn, later of Columbia Pictures). By 1924 Adams was back with
BG: Educational.
BG: 
BG: Christie hired Adams for six comedies released in 1926 and 1927. The
BG: Christie comedies were more polite and less extreme than the slam-bang
BG: comedies of other studios, but Christie's soft-pedal comedy style did
BG: find an audience. Star comedians Jimmie Adams, Bobby Vernon, Lige
BG: Conley, Neal Burns, and Billy Dooley constituted a lineup that was no
BG: threat to Hal Roach, but nevertheless entertained millions with a style
BG: than neither Roach or Mack Sennett could or would provide.
BG: 
BG: Adams was also a singer. In 1930 he co-starred with burly comic Bud
BG: Jamison as "The Rolling Stones," a pair of singing vagabonds touring
BG: America. Adams also sang with The Ranch Boys, a musical group featured
BG: in Charley Chase comedies.

TR: * With director 'Peter Sellars' (qv) he worked on an opera based on former

QU: * "My roots are profoundly affected by American popular music, jazz,
QU:   ragtime, swing, rock. I'm not a quoter, nor a musical chameleon like
QU:   'William Bolcom' (qv), but my personal style does not deny its roots.
QU:   In today's so-called classical music, we've lost track of the
QU:   vernacular." [Opera News, October 1987]
QU: * On the hostile reaction to _The Death of Klinghoffer (2003)_ (qv): Hey,
QU:   it's hard to speak of this as if it's important. It's only an opera!
QU:   What really counts in our society is 'Madonna' (qv), hip-hop and
QU:   television.
QU: * I have to choose my words carefully. In the United States there is very
QU:   little opportunity for the Palestinians to make their case. In fact,
QU:   extreme pressure is exerted on how information is framed in the press
QU:   and on TV. So the use of the word terrorism has become very controlled.
QU:   If you are a mother hiding in your apartment in Gaza, and an Israeli
QU:   missile kills your children, you might think that this was terrorism.
QU:   But in the US that word can't be used in association with that kind of
QU:   action. Particularly here in New York the fact that I had given a
QU:   chorus to the Palestinians was taken by some people as political bias.
QU: * 'Pierre Boulez' (qv) has said some charming things about me. From an
QU:   early age I was inspired by great composers, writers, choreographers
QU:   and painters who could say something immensely important, yet also
QU:   reach a lot of people. Those 19th-century giants - Beethoven, Tolstoy,
QU:   Dickens, Wagner, Zola - had enormous audiences. Maybe that's not
QU:   possible for a serious artist today, because even very intelligent
QU:   people are distracted - by TV or movies - from reading novels or
QU:   listening to serious music. But if I've had success it's because I've
QU:   found ways to make statements that have integrity but are appreciable
QU:   beyond a tight little circle of cognoscenti. Which was not the case
QU:   with serious contemporary music when I was at [Harvard in the 1960s].
QU:   We had models, such as Boulez, who were real musical snobs.

QU: * Children should be educated and instructed in the principles of freedom.

QU:   restored. Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.
QU: * Old minds are like old horses; you must exercise them if you wish to
QU:   keep them in working order.
QU: * We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human
QU:   passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge
QU:   or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a
QU:   whale goes through a net. Our Constitution is designed only for a moral
QU:   and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for any other.
QU: * No man who ever held the office of president would congratulate a friend
QU:   on obtaining it.
QU: * You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket.
QU: * All men profess honesty as long as they can. To believe all men honest
QU:   would be folly. To believe none so is something worse.
QU: * I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study
QU:   mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and
QU:   philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation,
QU:   commerce and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to
QU:   study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and
QU:   porcelain.
QU: * Statesmen may plan and speculate for liberty but it is religion and
QU:   morality alone that can establish the principles upon which freedom can

QU: * A revolution of government is the strongest proof that can be given by a
QU:   people of their virtue and good sense.
QU: * Facts are stubborn things and whatever may be our wishes, our
QU:   inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the
QU:   state of facts and evidence
QU: * There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought
QU:   to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.
QU: * [last words]: Jefferson ('Thomas Jefferson (II)' (qv)) still survives.
QU: * The proposition that the people are the best keepers of their own
QU:   liberties is not true. They are the worst conceivable, they are no
QU:   keepers at all; they can neither judge, act, think, or will, as a
QU:   political body.
QU: * I always consider the settlement of America with reverence and wonder,
QU:   as the opening of a grand scene and design in providence, for the
QU:   illumination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part
QU:   of mankind all over the earth.
QU: * In my many years I have come to a conclusion that one useless man is a

TR: * He became a close friend of 'James Dean (I)' (qv) after playing a small
TR:   role in _Rebel Without a Cause (1955)_ (qv) and reportedly was
TR:   devastated when Dean was killed. Adams began behaving recklessly and
TR:   was arrested for speeding nine times in one year. He was placed on
TR:   probation, but the larger studios ignored the young actor, who had
TR:   become a pariah.
TR: * Spent $8,500 on advertising to win a 1963 Best Supporting Actor Academy
TR:   Award nomination for _Twilight of Honor (1963)_ (qv), but lost the
TR:   award on Oscar night to 'Melvyn Douglas' (qv) in _Hud (1963)_ (qv).

TR:   Oscar.

TR: * Raised in Garfield, NJ
TR: * Brother-in-law of 'Judy Nugent (I)' (qv).

TR:   legend.
TR: * His death has been cited in articles and books on Hollywood's unsolved
TR:   mysteries along with allegations that Adams was murdered, including
TR:   claims that no trace of the liquid sedative paraldehyde (one of two
TR:   drugs Adams died from) was ever found in his home, but a story in The
TR:   Los Angeles Times reported that stoppered bottles with prescription
TR:   labels were found in the medicine cabinet near the upstairs bedroom
TR:   where Adams' body was discovered. Actor 'Robert Conrad (I)' (qv) (his
TR:   best friend) has consistently maintained Adams' death was accidental.
TR:   Some people have pointed out the fact that Adams died shortly before
TR:   his friend 'Elvis Presley' (qv) filmed his "Memphis Comeback" concert,

TR:   window to enter the house, and discovered the actor dead in his
TR:   bedroom.
TR: * Shortly before his death, Nick bought a plane ticket with his own money
TR:   and flew to Rome to co-star with 'Aldo Ray' (qv) in a sci-fi horror
TR:   movie called "Murder in the Third Dimension". Once he got there he
TR:   found out no one had told him the project had been scrapped.
TR: * An unabashed publicity seeker, he once worked at the Warners Theater in
TR:   Beverly Hills as a doorman, usher and maintenance man, but was fired
TR:   after putting his own name up on a marquee board as a promoting stunt.
TR:   He also freely used his friendships with 'James Dean (I)' (qv) and
TR:   'Elvis Presley' (qv) for self-promotion. He once claimed he was being
TR:   stalked by a crazed female James Dean fan and had himself photographed
TR:   at Dean's grave, pensively clutching flowers.
TR: * Career began in New York City and won his first acting job playing the
TR:   role of Muff Potter in a small stage production of "Tom Sawyer". He
TR:   relocated to try his luck in Los Angeles after years of struggle back
TR:   East.
TR: * Was offered a playing position in minor league baseball as a high school
TR:   teen with the St. Louis Cardinals but turned it down because of the low
TR:   pay. He briefly worked as a bat boy for the Jersey City Giants, a local
TR:   minor league team.
TR: * The son of Peter Adamshock and Catherine Kutz, Nick's father was a
TR:   Ukrainian-born anthracite coal miner. Despite being broke, the family

TR:   mining accident, and wound up in Jersey City, New Jersey.

DD: 15 November 1958, Beaufort, South Carolina, USA (heart attack)

BG: Journalist, author, biographer and historian Samuel Hopkins Adams was
BG: born along the banks of Lake Erie at Dunkirk, NY, on 26 January 1871.
BG: His parents were Myron and Hester Rose Hopkins Adams. His father was a
BG: minister and his mother the daughter of a theologian. Adams attended
BG: Hamilton College in Clinton, NY, and upon graduation began working as a
BG: newspaper reporter and later editor.
BG: 
BG: In the early years of the 20th century Adams became one of the pioneers
BG: in "muckraking journalism" with his exposes on the patent medicine
BG: industry published in Collier's Magazine. He would later write a number
BG: of informational articles on health and medicine and become an
BG: associate member of the American Medical Association, even though he
BG: lacked a background in medicine. Adams was probably the first
BG: journalist to write articles on health that could be understood by the
BG: average reader
BG: 
BG: Adams, first novel, "The Clarion", was published in 1914 and told the
BG: story of an idealistic editor trying to run an honest newspaper amid
BG: unscrupulous advertisers and corrupt politicians. A reoccurring theme
BG: throughout Adams' novels was the triumph of idealism over corruption.
BG: He wrote biographies on writer 'Alexander Woollcott' (qv), American
BG: politician Daniel Webster and President 'Warren G. Harding' (qv).
BG: Earlier supporters of Harding tried to suppress Adams' novel "Revelry"
BG: (1926) for its portrayal of the various scandals that had plagued the
BG: Harding administration.
BG: 
BG: Adams wrote a number of "detective Average Jones" mystery stories that
BG: would later be adapted to radio. Under the pseudonym Warner Fabian he
BG: wrote several novels about the "Lost Generation" in the years following
BG: World War I, of which "Flaming Youth" (1923) was probably his best
BG: known.
BG: 
BG: An expert on the history of New York state, Adams wrote a series of
BG: articles for The New Yorker on the Erie Canal that were gathered
BG: together in 1955 and published under the title "Godfather Stories". He
BG: also authored "Canal Town" (1944) that told the story of the canal's
BG: construction, "Banner by the Wayside" about a 19th-century troupe of
BG: traveling New York actors and "Sunrise to Sunset", which chronicled the
BG: rise of the union movement in New York's garment district.
BG: 
BG: Adams married Elizabeth R. Noyes (1877-1957) of Charleston, WV, in 1898.
BG: The couple had two daughters before their divorce in 1915. Later that
BG: year he married former stage actress Jane Peyton Van Norman
BG: (1880-1946).
BG: 
BG: Adams died on 15 November 1958, while at his winter residence in
BG: Beaufort, SC. He was survived by his daughters, Hester and Katherine.

NM: Adams, Scott (II)

RN: Scott Raymond Adams

DB: 8 June 1957, Windham, New York, USA

BG: Scott Adams, frustrated with the inanities of corporate America and its
BG: idiot bosses, created the comic strip "Dilbert" to lampoon all he
BG: considered repugnant-yet-funny in the workplace of cubicles. His title
BG: character Dilbert, the bespectacled MIT graduate with no mouth and
BG: flip-up tie, is part alter ego, part "every man." Dilbert was embraced
BG: by the comic-strip-reading public in 1989, and as of 2001, appeared
BG: through United Media's syndication efforts in an impressive 2,000
BG: newspapers in 50-plus countries translated in 19 languages. Born on
BG: June 8, 1957, Adams was raised in Windham, New York, and as a
BG: youngster, he tried his hand at cartooning. He entered art contests
BG: with little success. He was chosen valedictorian of his high school
BG: class (he claimed it was because "the other 39 people in my class
BG: couldn't spell valedictorian"). From 1979 to 1986, he worked at a San
BG: Francisco bank in a variety of dead-end jobs (as a bank teller, he was
BG: held at gunpoint twice), then worked at Pacific Bell from 1986 to June
BG: 1995, mostly in various engineering groups. Inspired from Adams' idle
BG: doodlings during dull company meetings, nerdy Dilbert embodied many
BG: characteristics of his co-workers. Adams kept his day job at Pacific
BG: Bell for 8 years after the comic strip was launched, partly for
BG: financial security and partly for relevant material. He was finally
BG: asked to leave by a new boss because of "budget constraints." Adams'
BG: education was not in art or engineering; he earned a bachelor's degree
BG: in economics from Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York, then earned an
BG: MBA from the University of California at Berkeley in 1986. Adams is
BG: credited with being the first cartoonist to print his e-mail address in
BG: his comic strip and dilbert.com was the first syndicated comic strip to
BG: go online in 1995. As of 2001, it was the most widely read syndicated
BG: comic on the Internet. Adams has also successfully launched a full
BG: repertoire of Dilbert-emblazoned products from desk calendars to
BG: T-shirts; a Dilbert Web site; a short-lived animated TV show in 1999;
BG: and his own line of food products, including the "Dilberito," a frozen
BG: vegetarian burrito. Adams' many best-selling Dilbert books include
BG: "Build a Better Life by Stealing Office Supplies"; "The Dilbert
BG: Future"; "I'm Not Anti-Business, I'm Anti-Idiot"; "Journey to
BG: Cubeville"; and "Random Acts of Management." Adams is an irreverent
BG: member of Mensa.

DB: 25 July 1929, Hollywood, California, USA

DD: 2 August 1995, Indio, California, USA (homicide)

HT: 6' 2"

BG: Although it's very unlikely that his admittedly cheap'n'cheesy films
BG: will ever be acknowledged as true works of cinematic art,
BG: director/producer/screenwriter Al Adamson did nonetheless make a slew
BG: of entertainingly trashy low-budget exploitation features for the
BG: drive-in market throughout the 60s and 70s. Al was born on July 25,
BG: 1929 in Hollywood, California. He was the son of actress Dolores Booth
BG: and actor/director Victor Adamson, who appropriately enough specialized
BG: in shoddy poverty row 30s Western programmers. Adamson's first foray
BG: into filmmaking was helping his father as director and producer on the
BG: movie "Halfway to Hell." In the mid 60s Al founded the prolific
BG: grind-house outfit Independent-International Pictures with
BG: producer/distributor Sam Sherman. Adamson cranked out a bunch of flicks
BG: in every conceivable genre: scuzzy biker items ("Satan's Sadists,"
BG: "Hell's Bloody Devils," "Angels' Wild Women"), gritty Westerns ("Five
BG: Bloody Graves," "Jessi's Girls"), silly soft-core comedies ("The
BG: Naughty Stewardesses," "Blazing Stewardesses"), funky blaxploitation
BG: ("Mean Mother," "Black Heat"), ridiculous science fiction dross (the
BG: gloriously ghastly "Horror of the Blood Monsters"), two Jim Kelly
BG: martial arts action outings ("Black Samurai," "Death Dimension"), lurid
BG: horror fare ("Dracula Vs. Frankenstein," "Brain of Blood," "Nurse
BG: Sherri"), and even a tongue-in-cheek soft-core science fiction musical
BG: ("Cinderella 2000"). Moreover, Adamson served as a producer for both
BG: the exciting Fred Williamson blaxploitation vehicle "Hammer" and the
BG: acclaimed made-for-TV drama "Cry Rape." The casts of Adamson's movies
BG: were made up of oddball, but enthusiastic amateurs and faded name
BG: thespians who include Kent Taylor, Russ Tamblyn, Lon Chaney, Jr. and
BG: the ubiquitous John Carradine. Al frequently gave his wife Regina
BG: Carrol sizable parts in his films. Moreover, Adamson was a mentor for
BG: future schlock feature directors Greydon Clark and John "Bud" Cardos.
BG: Al was also instrumental in launching the career of ace cinematographer
BG: Gary Graver. In addition, Adamson kept fellow top cinematographers
BG: Laszlo Kovacs and Vilmos Zsigmond employed in their early salad days.
BG: Al Adamson's life came to a brutal and abrupt untimely end at age 66
BG: when he was murdered by live-in contractor Fred Fulford on August 2,
BG: 1995.

DB: 23 October 1882, Dundee, Tayside, Scotland, UK

DD: 28 November 1945, North Hollywood, California, USA

BG: Ewart Adamson (1881-1945), born in Dundee, Scotland, went to sea at the
BG: age of 14. He was in the Canadian Army during WWI, and was promoted
BG: through the ranks from private to major during his tour of duty in
BG: France and Belgium.
BG: 
BG: Prior to his arrival in Hollywood, in 1930, Adamson spent five years as
BG: a tin-mine manager in Perak, where the inspiration for what later
BG: became the 1944 Republic serial "Haunted Harbor" came when he and
BG: several associates discussed several ways of salting a mine. A
BG: discussion only, by bored men, but a 1944 novel came from it.
BG: 
BG: Settling in Hollywood in 1930, Adamson became a prolific screen writer
BG: and, in addition to writing over 145 shorts, also provided stories and
BG: screen plays for features for Warner Bros., RKO, Chesterfield and Grand
BG: National, among others. In the 40s he wrote four features for Republic,
BG: and films for PRC and Monogram.
BG: 
BG: His novel (using his "nom de plume" of Dayle Douglas) was published by
BG: Mystery House of New York on June 12, 1943, and was sold to Republic
BG: Pictures on December 6, 1943. Retaining the novel's title, Republic
BG: produced it as a serial shot between April 14 and May 18, 1944.

HT: 5' 11"

BG: Award-winning filmmaker Kent Adamson began making movies at the age of
BG: 11 in San Diego, California shooting family events with a Super-8
BG: camera he borrowed from his uncle. At 18, he attended USC School of
BG: Cinema - Production. His professional career in film and television
BG: began in Los Angeles, working for Pierre Cossette on the pilot of
BG: "Great American Homes", also at the age of 18. He went on to work on
BG: several drive-in movies for Roger Corman and Charles B. Griffith at New
BG: World Pictures, then Menahem Golan at Cannon Films in the late 1970s
BG: and early 1980s. A pioneer in Home Entertainment, DTV Movies, and early
BG: Pay Per View/On Demand/Cable, Kent was Senior VP of Production at
BG: Select and On TV National Movie Channels throughout the 1980s. He then
BG: worked for Sony Pictures, and other corporate entertainment companies
BG: in the 1990s/2000s. Among several projects, he helped to launch the DVD
BG: format. Kent Adamson has also had a lengthy career from the 1980s to
BG: the present day as a documentary historian, shooting over 1,000 hours
BG: of film, video, and digital media, as well as recording extensive oral
BG: histories on Los Angeles & Hollywood underground nightlife and history,
BG: Spoken Word Poetry and Slam Poets, and underground music/nightclubs. He
BG: worked closely with actress Ann Savage from 2000 - 2008 on her official
BG: print biography and a feature length documentary of her life and films.
BG: 
BG: Originally, in the 1960s and 70s, Kent was inspired by visits to his
BG: family in Los Angeles and Hollywood and revival screenings at La
BG: Jolla's famed Unicorn Cinema. The Unicorn screened the best available
BG: 35MM prints of such classic films as _The Third Man (1949)_ (qv), Shoot
BG: The Piano Player (1933), _Footlight Parade (1933)_ (qv) and all the
BG: works of 'Buster Keaton' (qv) and 'Charles Chaplin' (qv). This was
BG: before the home video revolution. After having a hole blown though his
BG: head and all sense of vision and hearing overwhelmed by
BG: _The Third Man (1949)_ (qv), it would be SIX YEARS before Kent would
BG: see another quality screening of the film. The Unicorn Cinema also
BG: hosted special Club screenings which frequently invited filmmakers to
BG: screen their work and mingle with members. This allowed Kent to receive
BG: early career/film school advice from such notables as
BG: 'Robert Wise (I)' (qv) with _The Andromeda Strain (1971)_ (qv),
BG: 'George Seaton (I)' (qv) with _Airport (1970)_ (qv) and
BG: 'Vincente Minnelli' (qv) with _An American in Paris (1951)_ (qv) and
BG: _Gigi (1958)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: As a teenager, Kent began to win awards as a filmmaker, and in acting
BG: and public speaking. He played Horatio in Shakespeare's Hamlet, a
BG: Kearny High School production that won first place in statewide
BG: competition. He was accepted into the USC Department of Cinema and
BG: achieved his then young, but lifelong dream of moving to Hollywood. At
BG: USC, he enjoyed studying under the beloved Bernard Kantor, Arthur
BG: Knight, Arthur Mayer, Gary Prebula and Richard Jewell. As a student,
BG: Kent was privileged to be on the set of _The Big Red One (1980)_ (qv)
BG: and observe the legendary director, 'Samuel Fuller' (qv), at work. He
BG: also met and worked with Academy Award-winning producer/writer/director
BG: 'Robert Pirosh' (qv), and became friends with student filmmakers
BG: Richard Redeman and Larry Wessel. While still at USC, Kent worked for
BG: 'Roger Corman' (qv) and assisted 'Menahem Golan' (qv) during the last
BG: days of the drive in movie market. Cannon was a prolific training
BG: ground in screenplay development, professional line production,
BG: production management and the marketing and promotion of feature films.
BG: Led by the larger than life personalities of 'Menahem Golan' (qv) and
BG: 'Yoram Globus' (qv) (Cousins) known as the "Go Go Boys" and "The GG's",
BG: Cannon functioned as a mini-studio in continual production. Kent worked
BG: for Cannon from the beginning of the GG's arrival in Hollywood. Kent
BG: functioned as a one-man story department for 'Menahem Golan' (qv),
BG: reading and writing summaries for over a thousand submitted
BG: screenplays. Privy to the inner workings of development of every Cannon
BG: film during the early 1980s, Kent learned every aspect of film genre
BG: first hand. From the "Ninja" cycle to Stallone's Over The Top to the
BG: musical Breakin' cycle. Quickly building a company of international
BG: proportions, the GG's also imparted a knowledge of international
BG: finance, distribution and festival promotion to Kent.
BG: 
BG: At the dawn of the Satellite/Cable TV and Home Video era, Kent
BG: transitioned from drive-in movie production to these new markets,
BG: eventually working under USC alum, filmmaker Richard Redeman at SelecTV
BG: of America. He ultimately became Senior Vice President of Production,
BG: responsible for the production of thousands of hours of programming,
BG: advertising, interstitial material and promotional materials. Kent then
BG: transitioned into the freelance production world working with
BG: Time-Warner, Sony Pictures, Columbia TriStar Home Video, New World
BG: Pictures, CBS, NBC, HBO, Showtime and many others. Kent also co-founded
BG: "Magic Lantern Film and Video with fellow USC alum "Cochise" Miller.
BG: 
BG: Kent is based in Hollywood, California. Within a family tradition of
BG: service to the community, he devotes time to Charitable/Nonprofit work
BG: in the areas of Historic Preservation, Food and Personal Support
BG: programs for the needy, and the encouragement of young creative
BG: artists. He was a full six year term member on the Board of Directors
BG: of Hollywood Heritage, a nonprofit which operates the DeMille/Lasky
BG: Barn - a now restored barn originally rented by 'Cecil B. DeMille' (qv)
BG: in 1913 - considered the first studio in Hollywood.
BG: 
BG: In 2005, Kent began working with 'Josh Caldwell (I)' (qv) developing and
BG: producing music, film and digital projects resulting in the launch of
BG: the band Les Blanks, the book project Savage Detours, and ongoing vinyl
BG: record and video releases of artists including Wammo of The Asylum
BG: Street Spankers, Fkenal, Jessica Schwartz Schwartz McGill, and several
BG: others.

NM: Adamson, Victor

RN: Albert B. Adamson

DB: 4 January 1890, Auckland, New Zealand

DD: 9 November 1972, Los Angeles, California, USA (heart attack)

BG: Someday a clever producer will tell the story of Hollywood's "Poverty
BG: Row" of the 1920s-'40s (although _Hearts of the West (1975)_ (qv) was a
BG: valiant effort, it left a lot to be desired), which was centered on
BG: Gower Street. So many fly-by-night production companies--which cranked
BG: out mostly westerns, because they were so cheap to shoot--were
BG: headquartered there that the area became known as "Gower Gulch." Such a
BG: story would have to include Victor Adamson, a man whose unique, if
BG: inept, cinematic vision rivaled that of schlockmeister icons
BG: 'Dwain Esper' (qv), 'Robert J. Horner' (qv) and later, the King
BG: himself, 'Edward D. Wood Jr.' (qv). Although he was born in Kansas
BG: City, Missouri, Adamson's family moved to New Zealand when he was very
BG: young, and he was raised there. He returned to the U.S. around 1916 or
BG: 1917, and attempted to break into the burgeoning film business. He had
BG: been a champion rider and roper in New Zealand and thought he was ripe
BG: for stardom in westerns. He brought with him a small film he had made
BG: in New Zealand and, astonishingly enough, actually managed to find a
BG: company willing to release it. After landing small parts in a few small
BG: movies, Adamson decided that the best road to stardom was one he would
BG: make himself, so he began to produce and star in his own films, using
BG: the name "Art Mix." Here's where it gets really confusing: for reasons
BG: known only to himself he decided to have an actor named George
BG: Kesterson also play the Art Mix character and, in an even more
BG: confusing turn of events, once hired a rodeo champion named Bob Roberts
BG: to also play "Art Mix." Cowboy superstar 'Tom Mix (I)' (qv) eventually
BG: filed a copyright infringement suit against Adamson because of his use
BG: of the Mix name. In a move that could only happen in Hollywood, Adamson
BG: got around that by finding a man whose real name actually was Art Mix
BG: and hiring him to play the character--so at one point there were four
BG: different men playing a cowboy named Art Mix! Kesterson and Adamson
BG: eventually parted ways, but Kesterson used the Art Mix name, despite
BG: Adamson's efforts to stop him, for the remainder of his career. It
BG: didn't really matter that much who played "Art Mix," though, as the
BG: films, all low-budget in the extreme with a reputation for
BG: laugh-inducing incompetence, were released via the states rights
BG: system--in which regional distributors bought the prints outright and
BG: kept them in circulation for as long as they could remain spliced
BG: together--which meant that not a whole lot of people wound up seeing
BG: them anyway. Even the most die hard western fan had trouble sitting
BG: through an Art Mix feature on the bottom half of a Saturday afternoon
BG: matinee. Most of his productions were two-day wonders shot for $2000 or
BG: so, featuring actors who had trouble remembering their lines,
BG: misspelled title cards, headache-inducing editing, a near total lack of
BG: understanding of sound, and very often the use of an impaired (visually
BG: or otherwise) cinematographer (i.e., his $2,500 out-of-focus
BG: extravaganza, _Range Riders (1934)_ (qv), in which the cameraman's
BG: competence apparently wasn't as important as his willingness to work
BG: for next to nothing). Adamson continued to produce and star in his own
BG: bottom-of-the-barrel westerns and appear in small roles in oaters made
BG: by others until the late 1930s, when he decided to concentrate mainly
BG: on producing, confining his acting chores to small parts in the
BG: innumerable B westerns being churned out in Hollywood at the time. His
BG: son, director/producer 'Al Adamson' (qv), kept the family name and
BG: reputation alive in the low-budget film market by grinding out
BG: micro-budgeted westerns, hilariously inept horror films and vapid
BG: softcore sex comedies for decades--he even managed to cash in on the
BG: blaxploitation craze of the '70s with a couple of stinkers-- until his
BG: murder, by a building contractor with whom he was having a legal
BG: dispute, in 1995.

BY: frankfob2@yahoo.com and Jack Backstreet

SP: * 'Dolores Booth' (qv) (? - 1959); 3 children

TR: * Son with Booth: 'Al Adamson' (qv)
TR: * Generally regarded as the worst director of low-budget
TR:   independently-produced westerns of the 1930's. This in itself is quite
TR:   an accomplishment, given the low expectation level of the genre.
TR: * That producers such as Adamson and the even sleazier
TR:   'Robert J. Horner' (qv) were able to survive in the movie business is
TR:   indicative of how even the worst of the independent producers could
TR:   succeed under the film exchange system of the 1920s and '30s, which
TR:   serviced thousands of theaters throughout the U.S. and Canada. Two
TR:   separate exchange systems existed: "States Rights", where the exchange
TR:   would buy a release for distribution in a particular state or region,
TR:   and the library-type exchange system, allowing distribution in a
TR:   territory for a predetermined length of time. In the latter, the trick
TR:   was to sign up enough exchanges willing to print and distribute product
TR:   (films such as Adamson's would be shown for one to three days on the
TR:   lower part of a double bill) for as little as $5 per day. The exchange
TR:   would negotiate advertising expenses (posters), normally only paying
TR:   for these items during a first run--some would attempt to sell or lease
TR:   them in advertising packages to the theaters with varying degrees of
TR:   success. A single print of even the worst Adamson film might be shown
TR:   three times in 400 unaffiliated theaters on the first run. These mostly
TR:   rural theaters had an insatiable demand for product, since they were
TR:   unable to obtain A-list features from major Hollywood studios. The film
TR:   would be shelved for six to nine months and then be recirculated on an
TR:   irregular basis until the print was worn out (a situation that
TR:   contributed immensely to these films being lost today). Money, at least
TR:   in theory, could trickle back to producers for years, enabling them to
TR:   eventually double or even triple their small investment. Some
TR:   independent producers were able to negotiate advances from exchanges
TR:   for future productions based on their successful track records,
TR:   although it's extremely unlikely that Adamson would have been able to
TR:   capitalize on this. Ironically, today the rare surviving posters of
TR:   Adamson's films are highly collectible, with prices that approach the
TR:   cost of many of his productions.

DD: 29 September 1988, New York City, New York, USA (heart attack)

BG: Charles Samuel Addams, or Chill as his friends called him, was born on
BG: January 7, 1912, in Westfield, New Jersey. Records show at the time of
BG: his birth the Addams' lived on Summit Avenue. They moved several times
BG: before taking up permanent residence in 1920 on Elm Street and stayed
BG: there until 1947. He attended public school in Westfield and was fond
BG: of visiting the Presbyterian cemetery on Mountain Avenue. When he was a
BG: youngster, he was caught by the police for breaking into a house on
BG: Dudley Avenue. On the second floor of the garage behind the main house
BG: there is a chalk drawing of a skeleton that is believed to have been
BG: drawn by Charles Addams. That house on Dudley and one on Elm Street is
BG: said to be the inspiration for the famous Addams Family house.
BG: 
BG: At Westfield High School, Charles became the art editor for the Weather
BG: Vane and drew many cartoons. He graduated in 1929 and attended Colgate
BG: University for one year. He switched to the University of Pennsylvania
BG: and then studied at Grand Central School of Art in New York City. His
BG: dream was to work for the New Yorker Magazine and started submitting
BG: cartoons as early as 1935, his very first one had the caption "I forgot
BG: my Skates." In 1940, he submitted "Downhill Skier," and that got him an
BG: offer to come on board full time for New York's premier literary
BG: magazine. He continued there until his death in 1988, drawing over
BG: 1,300 cartoons.

TR: * Television producer 'David Levy (II)' (qv) approached Addams with an
TR:   offer to create a series based on his "Addams Family" cartoons (they
TR:   met at the Palace Hotel lobby in New York). The Family was distinct
TR:   characters but without personality, so Addams gave his characters names
TR:   and more characteristics for the actors to use in portrayals. And so
TR:   was born _"The Addams Family" (1964)_ (qv).
TR: * He attended the Grand Central School of Art in New York City in 1931-32.
TR: * He attended the University of Pennsylvania in 1930-31. Situated on the
TR:   campus is a fine-arts building named after him, in front of which is a
TR:   sculpture of the silhouettes of the Addams Family.
TR: * He attended Colgate University in 1929-30.
TR: * Addams did cartoons for the Westfield High School student literary
TR:   magazine "Weathervane.".
TR: * He was fond of visiting the Presbyterian Cemetery on Mountain Avenue,
TR:   New Jersey.
TR: * He was described as artistically inclined, "drawing with a happy
TR:   vengeance" according to a biographer. His father encouraged this
TR:   practice in him.
TR: * One friend said of him, "His sense of humor was a little different from
TR:   everybody else's.".
TR: * As a child, his nickname was "Chill.".
TR: * Childhood friends recall that he was "known as something of a rascal
TR:   around the neighborhood" and "there was always a little group of boys
TR:   at his house doing things.".
TR: * His father, Charles Huy Addams, was a piano-company executive who had
TR:   studied to be an architect.
TR: * His first wife, Barbara Jean Day, was said to resemble his cartoon
TR:   character Morticia Addams.
TR: * His first marriage lasted eight years.
TR: * In the divorce settlement with his second wife, Barbara Estella Barb
TR:   ('Lady Colyton' (qv)), she was awarded copyright to some of his work.
TR: * At one point, his second wife Barbara got him to take out a $100,000
TR:   insurance policy. Addams consulted a lawyer on the sly, who later
TR:   humorously wrote, "I told him the last time I had word of such a move
TR:   was in a picture called _Double Indemnity (1944)_ (qv) starring
TR:   'Barbara Stanwyck' (qv), which I called to his attention." In the
TR:   movie, Stanwyck's character plotted her husband's murder; however, no
TR:   one has accused Barbara Barb Addams of attempting the same.
TR: * He married his third and final wife, Marilyn Matthews Miller in a pet
TR:   cemetery.
TR: * Because of _"The Addams Family" (1964)_ (qv), "New Yorker" editor
TR:   William Shawn banned the cartoons from his magazine, regarding the show
TR:   as being at odds with the sophisticated readership he wished to
TR:   cultivate. The ban was lifted after Shawn's 1987 retirement.
TR: * He is mentioned in Edward Eager's fantasy novel "Knight's Castle," as
TR:   Chas Addams (how he signed his cartoons.).
TR: * His first drawing in "New Yorker" ran on February 6 1932, and was a
TR:   sketch of a window washer.
TR: * His cartoons regularly appeared in the "New Yorker", as well as in
TR:   "Collier's Weekly" and "TV Guide.".
TR: * During World War II, he served at the Signal Corps Photographic Center
TR:   in New York, making animated training films for the Army.
TR: * Noted director 'Alfred Hitchcock (I)' (qv) was a friend of Addams, and
TR:   owned two pieces of original Addams art. In Hitchcock's film
TR:   _North by Northwest (1959)_ (qv), a scene pays homage to Addams: when
TR:   Roger Thornhill meets Eve with Mr. Vandamm and Leonard, he comments,
TR:   "The three of you together. Now that's a picture only Charles Addams
TR:   could draw.".
TR: * In 1961, Addams received a Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers
TR:   of America for his body of work.
TR: * From 1985, Addams lived in Sagaponack, New York. The estate where his
TR:   family lived was nicknamed "The Swamp.".
TR: * A scholarship in his name was founded in 1991: the Charles Addams Art
TR:   Scholarship.
TR: * Addams drew more than 1,300 cartoons over the course of his life.
TR: * Addams served as an escort for celebrities on social occasions; his
TR:   roster includes 'Greta Garbo' (qv), 'Joan Fontaine (I)' (qv), and
TR:   'Jacqueline Kennedy (I)' (qv).
TR: * In 1946 Addams met and became friends with sci-fi writer
TR:   'Ray Bradbury' (qv), after meeting at "Mademoiselle" magazine. The
TR:   magazine was going to publish Bradbury's short story "Homecoming", the
TR:   first in a series of tales about the Elliotts, a family of vampires
TR:   living in Illinois (for which Addams had made an illustration). Addams
TR:   and Bradbury were going to collaborate on a book chronicling the
TR:   Elliott Family's complete history, with Bradbury writing and Addams
TR:   illustrating, but it never happened. However, in October 2001
TR:   Bradbury's collection of tales on the Elliot Family was published, in
TR:   an anthology called "From the Dust Returned." The book had Addams's
TR:   original 1946 illustration on its cover, along with a narrative from
TR:   Bradbury and an explanation of his work with Addams.
TR: * He was nominated for the 2012 New Jersey Hall of Fame for his
TR:   contributions in the General Category.
TR: * Upon his death, he was cremated and his ashes were interred at the
TR:   Charles Addams Estate Grounds, Sagaponeck, Suffolk County, New York in
TR:   the family pet cemetery.

BG: Hoblit, Deran Sarafian, Rod Holcomb, and the late Ted Demme. His

BG: 
BG: The industry knowledge and insight that Lou was able to gain from

BG: and create Mission Launch, a representation company with which he
BG: applies the same successful concepts to a very small group of actors,
BG: giving them the much needed personal direction with their careers. He
BG: believes in quality, not quantity, and that formula, mixed with

NM: Addy, Wesley

RN: Robert Wesley Addy

DB: 4 August 1913, Omaha, Nebraska, USA

DD: 31 December 1996, Danbury, Connecticut, USA

BG: Character actor Wesley Addy began his prolific career as a prime player
BG: on the classical stage before coming to occasional films and TV in the
BG: early 1950s. Known for his intelligent, white-collar demeanor and lean,
BG: icy, cultivated menace, the silver-haired performer, who was actually
BG: born in Omaha, Nebraska, was often mistaken as British.
BG: 
BG: Majoring in economics at the University of California in Los Angeles,
BG: Wesley switched gears and trained in summer theater on Martha's
BG: Vineyard before trekking to New York City to pursue a professional
BG: career. In 1935, the actor made his Broadway stage debut with
BG: 'Orson Welles' (qv) in 'Archibald Macleish' (qv)'s "Panic". He
BG: continued with roles as both Marcellus and Fortinbras in
BG: 'Leslie Howard (I)' (qv)'s production of "Hamlet". Other Shakespearean
BG: roles during this early period included Hotspur in "Henry IV, Part I",
BG: Benvolio in "Romeo and Juliet" and Orsino in "Twelfth Night". He often
BG: performed the Bard in the company of such legendary interpreters as
BG: 'Orson Welles' (qv), 'Laurence Olivier' (qv) and, more frequently,
BG: 'Maurice Evans (I)' (qv).
BG: 
BG: World War II interrupted Addy's early momentum but he eventually
BG: returned to the theatre following his tour of duty and played opposite
BG: 'Katharine Cornell' (qv) in "Antigone" and "Candida". A continued
BG: presence on Broadway, he had strong stage roles in "The Traitor,"
BG: "Another Part of the Forest," "King Lear" and "The Leading Lady".
BG: 
BG: In 1951, the 38-year-old Addy made his film debut in the drama
BG: _The First Legion (1951)_ (qv) and would be seen from time to time
BG: throughout the decade in such dramatic fare as
BG: _Scandal Sheet (1952)_ (qv), _My Six Convicts (1952)_ (qv) and
BG: _Time Table (1956)_ (qv). Some of his chillier roles came in films
BG: directed by 'Robert Aldrich (I)' (qv), who utilized the actor quite
BG: often -- _Kiss Me Deadly (1955)_ (qv), _The Big Knife (1955)_ (qv),
BG: _The Garment Jungle (1957)_ (qv), _Ten Seconds to Hell (1959)_ (qv),
BG: and the Grand Guignol classics
BG: _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)_ (qv) and
BG: _Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964)_ (qv).
BG: 
BG: Never acquiring a strong footing in the movies, Wesley changed his
BG: on-camera focus in the 1960s to TV and also sought out theatre roles as
BG: well. In 1961, Wesley married actress 'Celeste Holm' (qv). Together
BG: they proved a strong stage coupling in both comedies and dramas --
BG: "Invitation to a March," "A Month in the Country," "Mame," "Candida,"
BG: "Light Up the Sky," "Mama" and "With Love and Laughter".
BG: 
BG: A reliable, durable performer, Wesley played suave gents and villains on
BG: TV. A major portion of his work came from daytime soaps -- including
BG: "The Edge of Night," "Days of Our Lives," Ryan's Hope" and "Loving".
BG: Later films included _Seconds (1966)_ (qv), _Network (1976)_ (qv),
BG: _The Europeans (1979)_ (qv) and _The Verdict (1982)_ (qv). He continued
BG: to act close to the end. His last film role was as a judge in
BG: _Before and After (1996)_ (qv) starring 'Meryl Streep' (qv) and
BG: 'Liam Neeson' (qv), which was released in the year of his death. He was
BG: 83.

NM: Ade (I)

HT: 5' 11 1/2"

BG: Born in London, in the early seventies, Ade tried his hand at various
BG: trades; from selling shoes, tickets for concerts, managing bands, to
BG: publishing an international horse racing magazine. Ade was known by Guy
BG: Ritchie who cast him as Tyrone the getaway driver in
BG: _Snatch. (2000)_ (qv). He then set off on the European press jaunt &
BG: traveled to the United States to preview the movie, addressing the
BG: audience at Harry Knowles' 24hr film festival at The Alamo, Texas.
BG: 
BG: Ade has since been involved with several other film and TV projects;
BG: notably as Infante in the Bond movie _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and
BG: Madonna's directorial debut _Filth and Wisdom (2008)_ (qv).

BY: Paul Becker

TR: * He knew Guy Ritchie for several years prior to both their endeavours
TR:   into the motion picture world. He & Guy became reacquainted just before
TR:   the release of Guy's showstopper "Lock Stock..." at which point Guy
TR:   politely informed Ade of his new project, titled at that time
TR:   "Diamonds" now known as _Snatch. (2000)_ (qv). He was always a
TR:   character that appealed to Guy and as the the days progressed during
TR:   the shooting, Guy realised that he had discovered a real diamond in the
TR:   rough.

NM: Ade, George

DB: 7 February 1866, Kentland, Indiana, USA

DD: 16 May 1944, Brook, Indiana, USA (heart attack)

BG: American writer, newspaper columnist, and playwright George Ade was
BG: first and foremost a self described Hoosier. Ade was born in Kentland,
BG: Indiana, one of seven children raised by John and Adaline Ade. While
BG: attending Purdue University, he met and started a lifelong friendship
BG: with cartoonist and Sigma Chi brother John T. McCutcheon and worked as
BG: a reporter for the Lafayette Call. In 1890, Ade was hired on by the
BG: Chicago Morning News (later known as the Chicago Record), where
BG: McCutcheon was working. He wrote the column, Stories of the Streets and
BG: of the Town. In the column, which McCutcheon illustrated, Ade
BG: illustrated Chicago-life. It featured characters like Artie, an office
BG: boy, Doc Horne, a gentlemanly liar, and Pink Marsh, a black shoeshine
BG: boy. Ade's well-known "Fables in Slang" was introduced in the popular
BG: column.
BG: 
BG: Ade's literary reputation rests upon his achievements as a great
BG: humorist of American character during an important era in American
BG: history. The 1890's marked the first large migration from the
BG: countryside to burgeoning cities like Chicago, where, in fact, Ade
BG: produced his best fiction. He was a practicing realist during the Age
BG: of (William Dean) Howells and a local colorist of Chicago and the
BG: Midwest. His work constitutes a vast comedy of Midwestern manners and,
BG: indeed, a comedy of late 19th century American manners.
BG: 
BG: Ade's fiction dealt consistently with the "little man," the common,
BG: undistinguished, average American, usually a farmer or lower middle
BG: class citizen (he sometimes skewered women too, especially women with
BG: laughable social pretensions).
BG: 
BG: Ade's followed in the footsteps of his idol 'Mark Twain' (qv) by making
BG: expert use of the American language. In his unique "Fables in Slang,"
BG: (1899) which purveyed not so much slang as the American colloquial
BG: vernacular, Ade pursued an effectively genial satire notable for its
BG: scrupulous objectivity. Ade's regular practice in the best fables is to
BG: present a little drama incorporating concrete, specific evidence with
BG: which he implicitly indicts the object of his satire-- always a type
BG: (e.g., the social climber). The fable's actual moral is nearly always
BG: implicit, though he liked to tack on a mock, often ironic moral (e.g.,
BG: "Industry and perseverance bring a sure reward").
BG: 
BG: As a moralist who does not overtly moralize, who is all too aware of the
BG: ironies of what in his day was the modern world, George Ade was perhaps
BG: our first modern American humorist, paving the way for people such as
BG: 'Will Rogers (I)' (qv) to follow. The United States, in Ade's lifetime,
BG: underwent a great population shift and transfer from an agricultural to
BG: an industrial economy. Many felt the nation suffered the even more
BG: agonizing process of shifting values toward philistinism, greed, and
BG: dishonesty. Ade's prevalent practice is to record the pragmatic efforts
BG: of the little man to get along in such a world.
BG: 
BG: Ade was a playwright (see "Other Works") as well as an author, penning
BG: such stage works as Artie, The Sultan of Sulu (a musical comedy), The
BG: College Widow, The Fair Co-ed, and "The County Chairman." He wrote the
BG: first American play about football.
BG: 
BG: After twelve years in Chicago, he built a home near the town of Brook,
BG: Indiana (Newton County). It soon became known for hosting a campaign
BG: stop in 1908 by 'William Howard Taft' (qv), a rally for
BG: 'Theodore Roosevelt' (qv)'s Bull Moose Party in 1912, and a homecoming
BG: for returning soldiers and sailors in 1919.
BG: 
BG: George Ade is one of the American writers whose publications made him
BG: rich. When land values were inflated about the time of World War I, Ade
BG: was a millionaire. The Ross-Ade football stadium at Purdue University
BG: was built with his (and David E. Ross's) financial support. He also
BG: generously supported his college fraternity, Sigma Chi, leading a
BG: fund-raising campaign to endow the Sigma Chi mother house at the site
BG: of the fraternity's original establishment at Miami University. Ade is
BG: also famous among Sigma Chis as the author of The Sigma Chi Creed,
BG: written in 1929, one of the central documents of the fraternity's
BG: philosophies.
BG: 
BG: While Ade's writings fell out of public favor as America struggled
BG: through the Great Depression and the onslaught of World War II, his
BG: legacy lives on. Ade populated his writings with comedic characters
BG: lifted from the streets and front porches of small Midwestern towns and
BG: peppered the language with witty slang; characters and situations that
BG: can still be found in movies and television sitcoms. Ade's comedic
BG: style is just as popular today as it was when he introduced it over a
BG: hundred years ago. While Ade was never considered a high-brow literary
BG: writer or a fashionably caustic social critic, he succeeded in what he
BG: had set out to do, he made America laugh.

TR:   Gap") dedicated his novel "Merton of the Movies" to him.
TR: * Unlike his literary idol, Mark Twain, Ade was particularly financially
TR:   savvy. He became a millionaire in his 40's and became an enthusiastic

NM: Adel, Ellina

DB: 26 September 1976, Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, USSR [now Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine]

HT: 5' 5"

BG: Ellina was born in Ukraine, near Dnepropetrovsk. At the age of 9 she got
BG: the dream to become an actress. After graduating High School, Ellina
BG: moved with her mom to Moscow to study acting. Unfortunately, because of
BG: her Ukrainian accent, she didn't pass the entrance audition.
BG: 
BG: Unphased, Ellina decided to work on her accent, and meanwhile took a
BG: position at "Mosfilm" cinema studio. While there, she worked with
BG: famous directors Vladimir Menshov and Alexander Mitta, among others, in
BG: their respective filming and production crews. Simultaneously, she
BG: successfully auditioned for several acting roles, including: A. Surin's
BG: film "My vesely, schastlivy, talantlivy!" (We are Cheerful, Happy,
BG: Talented!), G. Bezhanov's film "Gde nakhoditsya novelette?" (Where is
BG: Enohp located?), and as "Girlfriend" in E. Tsiplakova's movie short
BG: "Grazhdanin Ubegayuschiy."
BG: 
BG: Soon thereafter, Ellina was invited by V. Mazhurin to work as a play
BG: actor in Moscow 's "Musical Theater for Kids," organized by
BG: "Moscontsert." Ellina's work at the theater continued for two years.
BG: From 1990 to 1994 Ellina studied at the Russian Academy of Theater Arts
BG: (formerly GITIS). While studying there, she also played a role in E.
BG: Ginzburg's movie "Prostodushniy" and a main role in R. Liblik's film "A
BG: Silhouette in the Window across the Street".
BG: 
BG: Additionally, she performed as an entertainer in A. Mironov's "Festival
BG: of Actor's Song", and performed as a singer in popular television
BG: programs "Before 16 and Older" and "Morning Star." After graduating
BG: from the academy, Ellina accepted an invitation from Melbourn
BG: Entertainment ( Australia ) and worked there for several months.
BG: Returning to Moscow in 1995, she acted in V. Vinokur's "Moscow Theater
BG: of Parody" and acted as the "Red Hat" character in the TV mini series
BG: "V Gostyah u Scazki." In 1995, Ellina had the privilege of working with
BG: one of her favorite directors, T. Keosayan, as an actress in a music
BG: video for singing artist I. Allegrova.
BG: 
BG: The mid 1990s were difficult, empty years for Russian cinematography;
BG: big movies were dead and TV soap operas hadn't shown up yet. Despite
BG: the downturn, Ellina was fortunate to earn a role in the 1996
BG: television season of the program "Hidden Camera" (Skritaya Kamera). The
BG: following year, American impresario G. Belenky offered her a role in a
BG: US tour called "New Show." The show took Ellina to the US in January of
BG: 1998.
BG: 
BG: As prospects of Russian Cinema were slim, Ellina remained in America
BG: after the tour and continued working in the entertainment industry. Two
BG: years later, she again became a student and studied Cinema Arts at LAVC
BG: (Los Angeles Valley College). Four years of the study led to her A. A.
BG: Diploma in Cinema Arts. Since then Ellina has acted in many commercials
BG: and industrial/educational films. Her movie/television roles include
BG: "Born into Mafia" by V. Versace, "The Secret of the Ruby Scorpion" by
BG: M. Wike, "A Playhouse of Blood" by S. Oakley, "Russian Redneck" (TV
BG: Series) by Peter Zhmutski. Currently, Ellina works as an actress in
BG: joint projects between the US and Check-Republic. These projects bring
BG: short live events, plays, and entertainment to different countries
BG: around the World. Ellina is married and has one child.

QU: * Think about a woman. Doesn't know you're thinking about her. Doesn't
QU:   care you're thinking about her. Makes you think about her even more.
QU: * Obsessions and fixations are not really my field. All I know, when the
QU:   mind really grabs hold of something, look out.
QU: * Most of you have been where I am tonight. The crash site of unrequited
QU:   love. You ask yourself, How did I get here? What was it about? Was it
QU:   her smile? Was it the way she crossed her legs, the turn of her ankle,
QU:   the poignant vulnerability of her slender wrists? What are these
QU:   elusive and ephemeral things that ignite passion in the human heart?
QU:   That's an age-old question. It's perfect food for thought on a bright
QU:   midsummer's night.
QU: * In Kyudo philosophy, you don't aim--you become one with the target.
QU:   Then, in fact, there's nothing to aim at. I find it works well with
QU:   women, too. Give it a try.

BG: Born in Utah in 1914, Hal Adelquist moved to Los Angeles with his family
BG: when he was approximately six years old. In 1933, in the depths of the
BG: Depression, he went to work for Walt Disney Studios in a variety of
BG: positions, from the Personnel office to the Story Department to the
BG: Production Department. He worked on
BG: _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)_ (qv) as an assistant director,
BG: although uncredited, and eventually became head of the Story
BG: Department. In 1955, when 'Walt Disney' (qv) was developing
BG: _"The Mickey Mouse Club" (1955)_ (qv), he assigned Adelquist to be the
BG: liaison between series producer 'Bill Walsh (I)' (qv) and the show's
BG: other department heads (casting, guest stars, story development, etc.),
BG: basically functioning as the show's production supervisor. He left the
BG: show after the first season and was assigned to produce the live shows
BG: for the Mickey Mouse Club Circus at Disneyland. Unfortunately the
BG: Circus was not a hit with Disneyland patrons. Aparently the pressures
BG: from putting on a large and complicated live show every day for the
BG: Circus, only to see it fail, and his subsequent falling out of favor
BG: with Walt Disney were more than Adelquist could handle, and according
BG: to Disney employees Adelquist began to develop a drinking problem. He
BG: subsequently resigned from the Disney organization, but when he asked
BG: to be re-instated some time later, Walt Disney refused to re-hire him.
BG: There's no record of his ever having worked in the entertainment
BG: industry after that. He died in Long Beach, California, on March 26,
BG: 1981.

BG: 
BG: Besides that he's a multi-faced sportsman. He practiced soccer, tennis,
BG: swimming and many more in his youth. At the age of 10 he realized
BG: martial arts are his passion and started taking Judo lessons for 4
BG: years and received a blue belt. The school stopped. He wanted to look
BG: for new sports and searched for something more athletic, with kicks,
BG: and found Shaolin Kempo, which he trained for 4 years as well. He quit
BG: Kempo thinking it wasn't fast enough and started doing Tae Kwon Do,
BG: which worked out fine. Within 3 years he would have his blue belt, but
BG: had to quit since he had to move for his study, and a serious leg
BG: injury.
BG: 
BG: While doing his study, he would move a lot, making new friends, seeing
BG: other countries and experimenting other arts. He did Karate, Aikijitsu,
BG: Capoeira, some Jiu-Jitsu and even Tae Bo. He also practiced some
BG: fitness. With his gymnastics friends from the group SUCA he regularly
BG: goes out for climbing, sailing and snowboarding.
BG: 
BG: Now after being kind of settled, he concentrates on martial arts again.
BG: Training hard gymnastics he recently started training in Tae Kwon Do
BG: again.
BG: 
BG: In 2003 Johan appeared in his first movie, in which he is also a
BG: stuntman and assistant choreographer. Johan made more movies with the
BG: B-Pro Stunt Team since 2004 and continues doing so.
BG: 
BG: Now occasionally Johan gives stunt courses with Raphael Klompers and
BG: other colleagues. Johan also spends as much time as possible with his
BG: friends. Another activity of Johan is voluntary work for cultural
BG: integration in the Netherlands.

TR: * Always improvises various of his scenes and lines.
TR: * Collected comic books and magic cards as a child. Now still collects
TR:   movies. Mostly action and martial arts.
TR: * Parents (mother Carlijn Thielen, father Jan-Hein Aders) got divorced
TR:   when Johan was 18 years old. They still get along as good friends.
TR: * A huge fan of Mortal Kombat films/games, WMAC-Masters, Marvel and DC

QU: * Sports are very important to me. I'm glad to say that I spent over 18
QU:   years of my life dedicated to martial arts and gymnastics. It's how I
QU:   met my friends, how I got to turn my passion into a job, how I got to
QU:   stay in shape and it makes me feel confident about myself.
QU: * Money isn't the most important thing in life. Happiness is. But
QU:   sometimes those two get mixed up.
QU: * Life needs to be lived and dreams need to be dreamed. That's the whole
QU:   point of enjoying life and having a goal in life.
QU: * Confidence is a great thing, but so is insecurity. When we can accept
QU:   our weaknesses, insecurity is the thing that thrives us into improving
QU:   ourselves. Someone who claims to not know insecurity, doesn't know
QU:   himself, or he's just a liar.

QU: * "When I was young, I read the Bible, just to inform myself of what they
QU:   are saying in it, knowing that the entity we call God is far beyond
QU:   books, it's a thing that you feel, it shows up so clear sometimes, just
QU:   to let you know you are not alone here. The Bible was so disappointing
QU:   to me, for the way in which they treated women. No God and no human
QU:   should discriminate females just because they are born females. So I
QU:   started searching for what other philosophies say and I found that
QU:   Buddhism is rather a fair one. Especially the teachings about
QU:   detachment. You are indeed the most free human when you learn not to
QU:   attach yourself to your belongings, house, fashion, jewelries, cars,
QU:   nationality, age, humans..." [on Buddhism for Enterbrain Publishing]
QU: * "Of course Japan is no longer that what I read in books about it. Like
QU:   the Borg used to say, "...resistance is futile. you will be
QU:   assimilated...". It has been transformed in an all American colony. I
QU:   wish Japan would have more respect for its own identity, culture and
QU:   tradition. So I was deeply thankful that an American movie like The
QU:   Last Samurai could come unbanned into existence."
QU: * "Photography is something like mathematics. When you obtain a perfect
QU:   geometry of elements inside your frame, every picture will be beautiful
QU:   or impressive, whatever the subject is. To obtain that geometry you
QU:   sometimes have to move your lens for only one millimeter, sometimes you
QU:   have to go in angles unsought before. That geometry strangely resonates
QU:   inside people, it's a thing we are born to detect." [on her
QU:   cinematography for Dream Drop (2004)]
QU: * "Make yourself a light. Rely upon yourself and don't depend upon anyone
QU:   else."
QU: * "The staff people are the ones that work the hardest. They come at the
QU:   shooting place hours before the cast, to set up and leave hours later,
QU:   after everything has been finely cleaned and packed away. They are the
QU:   ones to freeze outside in the cold, to be drenched by rain scorched by
QU:   the sun. But the entire glory goes to director and stars. In the
QU:   essence, everyone is just a human. How could I accept to have this
QU:   tiny, tired, overworked assistant girl hold the parasol for me without
QU:   feeling ashamed in my heart about this unfair world we are living in."
QU:   [on shooting for Peanuts (2006)].

NM: Adham, Zaid

DB: 14 January 1983, Amman, Jordan

BG: Zaid Adham is an Arab-Canadian mixed media artist with credits in
BG: photography, film, and television. Adham was born in Amman, Jordan in
BG: 1983 and raised for most of his life in the United Arab Emirates.
BG: 
BG: After graduating in 2006 with a dual BFA and BA in Visual Communication
BG: from the American Intercontinental University in London, Zaid went on
BG: to do an internship with CNN International, working with acclaimed
BG: journalist Christiane Amanpour as an assistant and translator during
BG: his tenure there. After moving back to Dubai, he began work in the
BG: advertising industry and was then chosen as a producer for the
BG: now-defunct Much Music Arabyeah channel. In 2008, he completed a
BG: post-graduate diploma in Post Production from Humber College in
BG: Toronto, Canada.
BG: 
BG: Zaid's first break into the film industry came with the acceptance of
BG: his film, Black Coffee, as a contender for the 2006 MINI Film Festival
BG: in Dubai. After a successful run in the independent film circuits in
BG: the UAE, he moved to Toronto in August of 2007 to pursue his filmmaking
BG: career full-time beginning with his production and directing of two
BG: short films, 'Minus 1' and 'Entropy'.
BG: 
BG: Primarily a film and television director, Zaid's work in mixed media is
BG: an unorthodox blend of abstract surrealism and audiovisual symbiosis.
BG: On screen, his work has often been described as Lynchian in tone, in a
BG: sense that it often flows as a tonal poem rather than a proper
BG: narrative.
BG: 
BG: Generally, however, Zaid's art tends to reflect humanity's fragile state
BG: of being, with influences in storytelling and atmospherics by such
BG: genre-defining directors as Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Luc Besson,
BG: Terry Gilliam and Quentin Tarantino.
BG: 
BG: Zaid has recently returned to Dubai where he produces and directs
BG: adventure travelogues inspired by the work of former Monty Python star
BG: Michael Palin.

BG: There's one central driving force that turned Kamafi into a writer --
BG: poverty. He was born the third son to a single mom with four
BG: ill-mannered children, and raised in the rough Kingshighway
BG: neighborhood of St. Louis, MO. But that poverty forced him to have a
BG: vivid imagination which he employed by writing and illustrating
BG: (crudely) a series of comic books in order to pay for lunch.
BG: 
BG: The central themes of his work are Identity and Redemption and his
BG: heavily researched scripts tend to favor the Thriller, Sci-Fi, and
BG: Action genres. This led award-winning Director Devorah Rubenstein, to
BG: make him her Director of Development for Noble House.
BG: 
BG: Although Kamafi has been exposed to every level of production, his heart
BG: is forever linked with the pen. He has written well over fifteen
BG: features, five tv shows, and numerous shorts and comic books. He's also
BG: done script coverage analysis for Bill Duke Productions, The Oxygen
BG: Network, Carsey-Werner, and Universal. He uses a trademark 6 Act format
BG: to write scripts and credits it with his ability to turn a script
BG: around very quickly.

QU: * (In this business) You'll so loose track of which way is up when your
QU:   being put down. You've got to be strong and do what you feel in your
QU:   heart regardless of who's around. I know it might seem bold but (our
QU:   beliefs), that's all we have.
QU: * I do not believe in heroes, I believe that we are all part of one race
QU:   (human). We are all equal, we are all obligated to help each other when
QU:   it is needed. That does not make one individual special or super, that
QU:   individual is simply doing what we are all supposed to. Unfortunately
QU:   most of us don't.
QU: * I want to live a simple life, I could care less about fame or a big
QU:   house or big car or awards. If you have those things you must work hard
QU:   to maintain them and live up to a name. I want to work when I want to
QU:   work and work on what I want to work on. I wish to live the way I want
QU:   to live and not be restricted to maintaining anything but my peace of
QU:   mind.
QU: * In terms of idolization: I was not raised with that mentality. I do not
QU:   idolize anyone. There are individuals whom I consider versatile artists
QU:   and good people and those who lack in that area. If you idolize an
QU:   individual for what they have accomplished in life, How the hell will
QU:   you ever find yourself? idolizing another individual will not help you
QU:   discover who you are, it will not help you find your strengths and
QU:   overcome your weaknesses. You will never define yourself by mesmerizing
QU:   or imitating someone else.
QU: * There is an old saying that when you find a job that you love, you never
QU:   work a day in your life.
QU: * "Life is an orange", I remember someone told me that. Pity that I don't
QU:   remember who. But you gotta peel through the rough layers of life to
QU:   have the opportunity to taste the sweet and juicy, and That is soooo
QU:   true.
QU: * "Be yourself, express yourself and have faith in yourself. No matter how
QU:   weird you may be (and I am a weird brotha). No matter what path you
QU:   take in this life, be true to yourself".
QU: * It's not the good times that make you who you are, it's the bad times
QU: * "The more you seek the truth on the outside, the more you lose it. You
QU:   are the truth, you are the answer to your problems".
QU: * Good things happen to bad people, however great things happen to good
QU:   people.
QU: * It's the quiet people that get the most done, they don't waste time
QU:   talking.
QU: * Live! Do not simply survive. A life not lived to the fullest is a life
QU:   not worth living.
QU: * "In life I have made so many errors. However the more I make, the more I
QU:   learn. I just wish that I could learn without messing up. God! Is that
QU:   possible"?
QU: * Success is reserved for those who are willing to pay the price to get
QU:   it.
QU: * In terms of my martial arts training. I 1st started when I was 14 or 15,
QU:   I do not remember exactly. I just recall that my mom was real adamant
QU:   about me learning. I'm glad she did. I'm so coy at times, that I don't
QU:   know if I would have the courage to do the things I that I have done in
QU:   life if she hadn't made me. Thanks mom.
QU: * It has to be right! (on choosing a lover) You cannot have any
QU:   ambiguities. Whatever is paramount to you must be paramount to her and
QU:   vice versa. It must be internal not physical. They must be on you're
QU:   level in terms of speech, dogmas, education and hobbies. If they
QU:   aren't, it will never work and don't do it. But..... but if they are?
QU:   Who cares what race they are!! All it is is a color (at least to me.)
QU:   If everything points to yes, then go for it Damn it!!! I know I would.
QU: * In terms of turning concepts into achievements. If you love it you'll do
QU:   it, and if you don't you won't. It's that simple.
QU: * I'm going to make it if it kills me! Oh man, please don't let it kill
QU:   me.
QU: * I am so incredibly impatient. If anything, that will be my downfall.
QU: * The sky is the limit, and the limit is the sky!
QU: * I'm not broken, so don't try to fix me. I am the exact way I'm supposed
QU:   to be (they know who they are).
QU: * I definitely have days when I fall down & cry my eyes out, but I will
QU:   never quit. Not ever.
QU: * There are times when everyone wants you to fail, everyone is hoping that
QU:   you cannot achieve. There is no one in your corner or rooting for you.
QU:   Then you succeed. That is the very definition of passion! That is the
QU:   very definition of desire!! No matter what, never surrender you
QU:   desire!!

NM: Adkins, Scott (II)

DB: 17 June 1976, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, UK

HT: 5' 11"

BG: Scott Adkins was born in Sutton Coldfield, England, on June 17th, 1976,
BG: into a family that for generations were Butchers. Along with his elder
BG: brother Craig, he was raised by John and Janet Adkins, a loving
BG: middle-class family. It is worth mentioning that Scott's great, great
BG: grandmother was of Spanish descent. Scott attended Bishop Vesey's
BG: Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. Probably not the best of students,
BG: he used to sneak downstairs after his parents had gone to bed and watch
BG: films all night then fall asleep during lessons. A natural athlete,
BG: Scott enjoyed a variety of sports as he grew up, but when he was 10
BG: years old, he accompanied his father and brother to the local Judo
BG: club. The attraction was instantaneous. Idolising stars such as
BG: 'Bruce Lee (I)' (qv) and 'Jean-Claude Van Damme' (qv), Scott began to
BG: train everyday. He took over his Dad's garage and turned it into his
BG: own Dojo. He even had a shrine to 'Bruce Lee (I)' (qv) in there that he
BG: would bow to. He remembers being mugged on a bus when he was around 13
BG: and that really kicked his training into overdrive. He wasn't ever
BG: going to let that happen again. At the age of 14, Scott went on to
BG: train in Tae Kwon Do under the instruction of Ron Sergiew with the
BG: T.A.G.B. After a few years, he moved on to Kickboxing under Anthony
BG: Jones. He is now a fully trained Kickboxing Instructor for the P.K.A. A
BG: self confessed "film junkie" Scott's attention was drawn to acting
BG: through the Hollywood Greats. He enrolled in a drama class at Sutton
BG: Coldfield College. Being a shy lad he initially found it difficult to
BG: be put on stage in front of an audience. Finally, at the age of 21,
BG: Scott was offered a place at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of
BG: Dramatic Art. However, as an impoverished student, he found it hard to
BG: make ends meet without a grant and was forced to leave without
BG: completing the course. Very dejected he thought that was the end.
BG: 
BG: His first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial
BG: arts film called _Dei seung chui keung (2001)_ (qv) (aka Extreme
BG: Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and
BG: director 'Wei Tung' (qv) and English-born Hong Kong movie expert
BG: 'Bey Logan' (qv), Adkins found himself in the East for the first time.
BG: Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema's leading
BG: action directors including 'Woo-ping Yuen' (qv), 'Corey Yuen' (qv),
BG: 'Sammo Hung Kam-Bo' (qv) and the legendary 'Jackie Chan (I)' (qv).
BG: Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in
BG: BBC's _"Doctors" (2000)_ (qv) filmed at Birmingham's Pebble Mill. A few
BG: episodes in BBC's _"EastEnders" (1985)_ (qv) and
BG: _"City Central" (1998)_ (qv), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama
BG: _"Mile High" (2003)_ (qv) followed by a regular role in BBC's
BG: _"Holby City" (1999)_ (qv) as Bradley Hume, the assistant General
BG: Manager of Holby General.
BG: 
BG: Starring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of
BG: Talbot in _Special Forces (2003) (V)_ (qv) and Yuri Boyka" in
BG: _Undisputed II: Last Man Standing (2006)_ (qv). It was this film that
BG: broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a
BG: Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka in what has been hailed as one of
BG: the best American made Martial Arts films of recent times. Along with
BG: lead actor 'Michael Jai White' (qv), fight coordinator
BG: 'J.J. Perry' (qv) and the slick direction of 'Isaac Florentine' (qv)
BG: this movie has some unbelievably heart stopping fight scenes. After
BG: this Scott has had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like
BG: _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv) and _The Tournament (2009)_ (qv),
BG: and played 'Jean-Claude Van Damme' (qv)'s main adversary in Sony
BG: Pictures _The Shepherd: Border Patrol (2008) (V)_ (qv).

NK: The Great Eagle

DB: 12 February 1855, Odessa, Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire [now Ukraine]

DD: 1 April 1926, New York City, New York, USA

BG: Jacob Adler, the legendary 'Great Eagle' ('adler' is the German word for
BG: eagle) of the Yiddish theater, was one of the great American stage
BG: actors, ranking with Edwin Booth, John Barrymore and Marlon Brando.
BG: Adler also is famous as the patriarch of an acting dynasty that
BG: stretched over 100 years from the late 19th century to the 21st and was
BG: essential to the evolution of the American theater from melodrama to a
BG: new heights of realism and seriousness. Adler's life story not only
BG: elucidates the Golden Age of the Yiddish theater but is a testament to
BG: the survival of a culture in a world where many elements threatened to
BG: extirpate it.
BG: 
BG: Adler was born in Odessa in Imperal Russia on February 12, 1855 and was
BG: stricken with the theatrical bug as a teenager. He joined a Yiddish
BG: theatrical company, the Rosenberg Troupe, in the 1870s. The Rosenberg
BG: Troupe was one of three Yiddish theatrical companies in Russia, the
BG: other two being Goldfaden's Troupe and Sheikevitch's Troupe. During his
BG: theatrical apprenticeship with Rosenberg, Jacob Adler proved himself to
BG: be an outstanding actor and a superb dancer but a bust as a balladeer.
BG: His poor singing thus cut off the lucrative operetta field for him. He
BG: compensated by becoming a great actor.
BG: 
BG: Adler gained experience as a member of the Rosenberg Troupe, touring
BG: Imperial Russia and putting on shows in Yiddish speaking communities.
BG: His first wife, Sonia Oberlander, was a member of the troupe. Adler was
BG: mentored by the eponymous head of the Troupe.
BG: 
BG: Jacob Adler became famous in the Polish and Russian Yiddish communities
BG: by playing the title role in Karl Gutzkow's drama 'Uriel de Acosta.'
BG: Acosta (1585-1640) was a marrano (a Christianized Jew of medieval
BG: Spain) who fought for enlightenment in the Jewish community of Holland,
BG: which was under Spanish suzerainty. The play was hugely popular, but
BG: the popularity of the Yiddish theater and its tackling of serious,
BG: didactic fare rather than melodramas and musicals beloved by the masses
BG: made it suspect as a subversive influence.
BG: 
BG: The "modern" Yiddish theater can be seen as evolving out of the Haskala
BG: (Jewish Enlightenment) rather than from the religious Purimspiel. The
BG: unenlightened and viciously anti-semitic Russian oligarchy launched a
BG: serious of pogroms in the 1880's that almost wiped out Jewish culture
BG: in Russia. Jews started emigrating from Russia en masse, with whole
BG: villages sometimes uprooting and leaving for more hospitable climes
BG: such as North America. Jewish culture was dealt a further blow when
BG: Czar Alexander III issued a ukase banning the Yiddish theater. Jacob
BG: Adler had no choice but to leave Russia; he emigrated to England at the
BG: end of November 1883.
BG: 
BG: Adler caught on as an actor with 'Dramatic Clubs.' In London,
BG: Odessa-born Adler had a hit with the play "The Odessa Beggar." He had
BG: an even bigger hit in Schiller's "The Robber," which brought him
BG: international fame. However, after six years in England, Adler decided
BG: to emigrate to the United States of America, moving to the great
BG: melting pot that was New York City.
BG: 
BG: In his memoirs (written in Yiddish), Adler recalled that "...when I came
BG: to America in 1889, I was already known by the proud name `Nesher
BG: Hagadol' (`The Great Eagle') and was an actor famous throughout the
BG: Yiddish theatrical world."
BG: 
BG: In the Big Town, The Great Eagle starred in various Yiddish theaters on
BG: Second Avenue in the Bowery, the "Jewish Broadway." There were hundreds
BG: of thousands of Jews in the New York Metropolitan Area in the Gay
BG: Nineties, and many of them spoke Yiddish as their first or only
BG: language. The theater was their major entertainment form in an era in
BG: which there was no radio, let alone television. It was not unusual for
BG: an impoverished Jewsh family to spend half of its week's wages wrestled
BG: from laboring in Lower East Side sweatshops at a night at the theater.
BG: Adler was successful enough to be able to open his own theater in the
BG: Bowery, the Union Theater on Broadway and Eighth Street. (He also later
BG: opened the National in the same area.)
BG: 
BG: Adler focused on producing dramatic plays as he was not successful in
BG: operettas and had a didactic bent. He wanted the theater to be socially
BG: significant rather than remain just a vehicle for vulgar entertainment
BG: like the melodramas beloved by the Jewish denizens of the Lower East
BG: Side. The linking up of Adler with the playwright Jacob Gordin not only
BG: revolutionized the Yiddish Theater but would revolutionize Amercan
BG: theater as a whole a generation later.
BG: 
BG: Gordin wrote "Sibina," "The Wild Man," and "The Yiddish King Lear,"
BG: Adler's greatest triumph. First assaying the role in November 1891,
BG: King Lear brought Adler even greater fame and solidified his reputation
BG: a great actor. Sara Adler, his second wife, said of the night he first
BG: took the stage as Lear: "He was not an actor that night, but a force."
BG: 
BG: The great success of Ader in Gordin's Lear represented the incorporation
BG: of the world classical canon into the American (and international)
BG: Yiddish theater. It also meant that "better" or more high-brow theater
BG: targeting the Yiddish-speaking Jewish audience could thrive. It had
BG: been an axiom that the 'Shund' tradition of Jewish Broadway, a focus on
BG: sensational melodrama, was the vehicle for success as it attracted the
BG: Jewish masses. The undisputed champion of the 'Shund' tradition was
BG: Boris Thomashefsky, who had mocked "The Great Eagle" as he had been
BG: more financially successful with his cheap melodramas than Adler was
BG: with his more prestigious theatrical offerings. However, with King
BG: Lear, Adler had not only an artistic triumph but a great financial
BG: success. Jacob Adler had made the "Jewish Broadway" safe for "better
BG: theater." A similar process would happen in the 1930s and 1940s when
BG: the Group Theatre, a company that included two of his children and
BG: which had roots in the quality Yiddish theater Adler had pioneered,
BG: would revolutionize the Great White Way of Old Broadway itself with a
BG: socially conscious "better theater."
BG: 
BG: Jacob's daughter Stella Adler, the Yiddish- and Group Theatre-affiliated
BG: actress who became one of the premier acting coaches in America, said
BG: about her father's success with The Yiddish King Lear that "The whole
BG: profession caught fire. Good theater apparently could 'make it'...
BG: Every actor wanted to play Gordin. Every actor wanted to play the
BG: classics, and the people came."
BG: 
BG: Adler achieved even greater success when, in 1903, he tread the boards
BG: on Broadway as Shylock in a production of Shakespeare's "The Merchant
BG: of Venice." He had another supreme triumph, humanizing a character that
BG: until then had been a one-dimensional, stereotypical villain, nearly
BG: always payed by a gentile in a red fright wig.
BG: 
BG: In 1910, Adler made his first and only feature film for the Selig movie
BG: studio, "Michael Strogoff," an adaptation of Jules Verne's Russian
BG: adventure story directed by 'J. Searle Dawley' (qv). The movie was one
BG: of the first full-length adaptations of a Verne work. "Michael
BG: Strogoff" was a first rate production with lavish production values,
BG: which were unusual for a movie from the Selig studio, but which bears
BG: testimony to the fame and respect Adler engendered. The film was
BG: notable for its climax, which entailed the burning of a Siberian city.
BG: 
BG: Adler' wrote his memoirs in Yiddish, which were published in the
BG: Yiddish-language socialist newspaper 'Die Varheit' ('The Truth') from
BG: 1916 to 1919. Adler fell ill in 1922, and though he recovered, his
BG: illness had aged him and sapped his powers. When he returned to front
BG: his theater before the adoring crowds, putting back on the grease-paint
BG: to play in Gordin's drama "The Stranger," he was a success, but had
BG: clearly lost the stamina necessary for the stage.
BG: 
BG: Jacob P. Adler died on April 1, 1926 in New York City. He was 81-years
BG: old. His second wife Sara Adler, herself a great actress who regaled a
BG: young 'Marlon Brando' (qv) with tales of her late husband and his
BG: acting philosophy that had a great influence on the tyro thespian, died
BG: in 1953. They had brought into being an acting dynasty, most notable in
BG: the successes of their son Luther and there daughter Stella. Stella's
BG: grandson 'David Oppenheim (VI)' (qv) is an actor who runs the
BG: influential acting school Stella created.
BG: 
BG: Adler's legacy was to effect the transformation of the Yiddish Theater
BG: into quality theater. His son Luther and daughter Stella, as members of
BG: the Group Theatre, an organization with roots firmly planted in the
BG: Yiddish theater, helped do the same to Broadway in the 1930s. He also
BG: helped influence a new generation of actors who came to prominence in
BG: the 1920's and 1930's most notably the great Paul Muni, who started in
BG: the Yiddish theater.
BG: 
BG: The Yiddish theater died out before World War II due to assimilation,
BG: the decline of Yiddish as a living language among American Jews, and
BG: the competition posed by radio and movies as a new form of cheap
BG: entertainment.
BG: 
BG: The nearly 70-year-old Adler, in the last chapter of his memoirs,
BG: explained the significance of the Yiddish theater and its enduring
BG: legacy: "Only dipped in blood and lit with tears of a living witness
BG: can the world understand how, with our blood, with our nerves, with the
BG: tears of our sleepless nights, we built the theater that stands today
BG: as a testament to our people."

SP: * 'Eileen Walser' (1952 - 1957) (divorced); 2 children
SP: * 'Sally Cline' (1959 - 1963) (divorced); 1 child

TR: * Harmonica player.
TR: * His last recording was a duet of "Young at Heart" with
TR:   'Cerys Matthews' (qv) from the Welsh pop band Catatonia.
TR: * Was nominated for an Oscar for his work on the soundtrack of
TR:   _Genevieve (1953)_ (qv), though he was originally kept off the credits
TR:   because of a McCarthy blacklisting.
TR: * Surname should be Zelakovitch, however his grandfather changed it to
TR:   Adler as he was sick of being the last to be called in US Immigration
TR:   queues.
TR: * Although both of his trials for having alleged Communist ties ended in
TR:   hung juries, Adler's U.S. engagements dried up virtually overnight.
TR:   Soon thereafter, he went into self-imposed exile in England, and never
TR:   returned to America permanently again.
TR: * Despite his self-imposed exile, he remained an American citizen, and
TR:   turned down a knighthood for that reason.
TR: * Along with fellow American John Sebastian (father of the same named
TR:   folk-rock performer), Adler was responsible for the harmonica, or mouth
TR:   organ, becoming accepted in serious musical circles. Such distinguished
TR:   composers as 'Darius Milhaud' (qv), 'Ralph Vaughan Williams' (qv), and
TR:   Cyril Scott, wrote works especially for him, and 'Maurice Ravel' (qv)
TR:   was so impressed with his arrangement of Ravel's "Bolero" for harmonica
TR:   that he asked to keep it as a souvenir.
TR: * When he was asked to do the score for Genevieve his agent asked for 750
TR:   pounds but was told the studio couldn't afford that much and instead
TR:   offered him 2.5% of the profits. The agent tried to convince him to
TR:   decline saying this film was intended to be a 'quota' film which would
TR:   probably never make back its cost in takings. He decided to take the
TR:   chance having liked what he had seen of the work thus far and as a
TR:   result, within four weeks it made back the costs and he found himself
TR:   able to pay to send his children through college with the money he made
TR:   from the movie.
TR: * It took 31 years after the Oscar nomination of the Genevieve score
TR:   before the committee finally sent him his certificate of nomination.
TR: * Three months after performing 'Sophisticated Lady' with
TR:   'Duke Ellington' (qv), the two of them performed the piece at a
TR:   nightclub. After the performance they were introduced to
TR:   'Billie Holiday' (qv), whose greeting was claimed by Adler to have been
TR:   'Man, you don't play that bloody thing, you sing it'.
TR: * He said on his tour in Australia, that 'George Gershwin' (qv) felt that
TR:   Rhapsody in Blue had been written for him after hearing how well the
TR:   song sounded when Larry played it on his harmonica. He always wished he
TR:   could perform it in public with Gershwin and then realized he could
TR:   despite Gershwin's death because he had an old recording made of
TR:   Gershwin playing the piece which he then got transferred to a keyboard.
TR:   This performance of him with Gershwin's recorded version can be heard
TR:   on the Live in Australia CD.
TR: * Performed 'George Gershwin' (qv)'s Summertime with 'Itzhak Perlman' (qv)
TR:   on _"Parkinson" (1971)_ (qv) in 1980.

NM: Adler, Luther

RN: Lutha Adler

DB: 4 May 1903, New York City, New York, USA

DD: 8 December 1984, Kutztown, Pennsylvania, USA

HT: 5' 7"

BG: The actor and Broadvway director Luther Adler was born into a Yiddish
BG: theatrical dynasty. One of the six children born to Jacob P. and Sara
BG: Adler, he made his debut in the world in New York City on May 4, 1903,
BG: originally billed as Lutha J. Adler. His full siblings Charles, Jay,
BG: Julia, and Stella (the famous acting teacher) as well as his
BG: half-siblings Celia and Abram Adler all appeared on Broadway, and his
BG: father Jacob, the biggest star of the Yiddish-language theater, was
BG: considered one of the great American actors.
BG: 
BG: The Yiddish theater was an important cultural venue in the days when the
BG: millions of Jewish immigrants in the greater metropolitan New York area
BG: spoke Yiddish as their first (and sometimes only) language. People who
BG: trained and appeared in the Yiddish theater were instrumental in the
BG: development of the modern American theater and film, and some,
BG: including 'Sidney Lumet' (qv), are still active in the 21st century. It
BG: was in this cultural milieu that Luther and his siblings got their
BG: grounding in acting and the theater.
BG: 
BG: Jacob Adler owned and operated his own stage in New York's Lower East
BG: Side, and Luther began appearing in the family productions at the age
BG: of five with the Adler production of "Schmendrick." He made his
BG: official debut as an actor at the age of 13 at his father's theater and
BG: his Broadway debut at the the age of 18.  Billed as Lutha Adler, he
BG: appeared in the Provincetown Players' production of Theodore Drieser's
BG: "The Hand of the Potter" in December 1921 at the Provincetown
BG: Playhouse,
BG: 
BG: Adler's first Broadway hit was "Humoresque" in 1923, and he appeared
BG: regularly in top productions throughout the '20s, including "Street
BG: Scene" (1929) and "Red Dust" (1929). Along with his sister 'Stella
BG: Adler", Luther Adler was one of the original members of the Group
BG: Theatre acting company, which was formed in 1931 by
BG: 'Harold Clurman' (qv) (his future brother-in-law), Cheryl Crawford, and
BG: 'Lee Strasberg' (qv). Others who would make their bones in the company
BG: were 'Elia Kazan' (qv), Julius "John" Garfield, 'Howard Da Silva' (qv),
BG: Franchot Tone, John Randolph, Will Geer, 'Clifford Odets' (qv) and
BG: 'Lee J. Cobb' (qv).
BG: 
BG: The Group Theatre was dedicated to bringing realism to the American
BG: stage and was instrumental in introducing the Stanislavsky technique
BG: into American acting. Most members were leftists if not communists, and
BG: the collective wanted to produce plays dealing with social issues. For
BG: the Groupe Theatre, Adler appeared in "Night Over Taos" (1932),
BG: "Success Story" (1933), "Alien Corn" (1933) and two seminal works of
BG: the American stage written by Odets: "Awake and Sing!" (1935) and
BG: "Golden Boy" (1937). He played opposite leading ladies
BG: 'Katharine Cornell' (qv) in "Alien Corn" (1933), his sister Stella in
BG: "Gold Eagle Guy "(1934), "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost" (both
BG: 1935), and 'Frances Farmer' (qv) in "Golden Boy" (1937).
BG: 
BG: His appearance as the urban ethnic boxer Joe Bonaparte in Odets' "Golden
BG: Boy" arguably was his greatest role, but when the film was made in
BG: 1939, he was passed over for the improbably cast Wlliam Holden, a
BG: white-bread WASP. Although Adler appeared in many motion pictures, his
BG: reputation would remain primarily that of a stage actor.
BG: 
BG: Adler became a director on Broadway in 1942, though his first staging,
BG: "They Should Have Stayed in Bed", was a flop, lasting but 11
BG: performances. He next directed 'Ben Hecht (I)' (qv)'s pro-Israel
BG: propaganda play "A Flag is Born" in 1946, starring the great
BG: 'Paul Muni (I)' (qv), a graduate of the Yiddish theater, and newcomer
BG: 'Marlon Brando' (qv), an Irish-American born-Protestant who had been
BG: trained by his sister Stella. The play, which raised money for Jewsh
BG: refugees from the Holocaust seeking sanctuary in Palestine, was a hit,
BG: running for 120 performances. He also directed "Angel Street" (1955)
BG: and "A View from the Bridge" (1960). He last appeared on Broadway as a

NM: Adler, Marie

HT: 5' 5"

BG: Even at a very young age Marie Adler knew that she would follow in her
BG: family's footsteps. She was the latest generation in a clan of
BG: entrepreneurs, and when she founded American Financial Lending, Inc.,
BG: it was no surprise that she quickly found herself running one of the
BG: leading financial institutions in California. Starting in 2000, with a
BG: small team of seven employees and big vision, she took over and quickly
BG: filled a 5000 square foot office. Under her innovative leadership
BG: American Financial Lending soon had similar offices nationwide. AFL
BG: became formidable player in the lending industry within its first year
BG: generating an impressive loan volume of $272 million. Three short years
BG: later the company would have an astounding total volume of $56 billion
BG: and employ nearly five hundred people.
BG: 
BG: Ms. Adler would go on to expand her operation into thirty-two separate
BG: branches doing business in forty-two states, and develop a highly
BG: successful internal training regimen for up-and-coming financiers.
BG: "After a few bad experiences with marketing companies I saw no need for
BG: the middle man. It simply made more sense and cents [laughs] to start
BG: my own marketing company," Ms. Adler remembers. Relentlessly working to
BG: stay ahead of the pack and stay on the cutting edge, she created online
BG: marketing campaigns that resulted in tens of thousands of hits per
BG: month. Adler's targeted directed-mail strategies reached over three
BG: hundred thousand prospects on a monthly basis and would generate a five
BG: percent return. Along the way Ms. Adler would also found Liberty
BG: Properties and would become an owner of a local Farmer's Insurance
BG: franchise.
BG: 
BG: A California business empire may sound like an unlikely prospect for a
BG: North Carolina native holding a degree in biochemistry, but Ms. Adler
BG: loved every moment of it. "Never judge a book by its cover," she said.
BG: She held the reigns at American Financial Lending until 2010, having
BG: successfully transformed the company from a simple mortgage lender to a
BG: proper mortgage bank. With the paperwork in hand Marie was ready to
BG: take AFL public, but the turbulent market forced her to make some tough
BG: decisions. As a privately held mortgage bank there were no government
BG: bailouts, and so she bailed the company out herself, determined to keep
BG: afloat and weather the storm with the last five banks. Ultimately
BG: realizing that she had to abandon that hope, she knew it was time to
BG: conquer her ultimate dream: Hollywood. "My intention was always to use
BG: the banking to give me the stability for the entertainment industry,
BG: but when life gives you lemons you make lemonade...then you open a
BG: lemonade stand and buy a truck..." While dealing with the heartbreaking
BG: task of dissolving AFL she began opening the doors for Adler &
BG: Associates Entertainment, Inc.
BG: 
BG: Learning the differences between the two businesses was a simple task
BG: for a hands-on CEO like Ms. Adler. She jumped at the chance to work on
BG: every film she could and in every position. "I needed to learn from the
BG: ground up like I did with my prior businesses." Her previous experience
BG: would prove to be universal: "Having a firm grip on what was different
BG: was most important to me. I needed to be a sponge for the logistics of
BG: the entertainment industry and I still am. I was pretty certain that
BG: business is business and managing people is managing people." Like she
BG: did with American Financial Lending, Inc. she strategically planned and
BG: built a firm foundation in a short time. What is next for Marie Adler?
BG: "Forget the bailout, I'm taking Hollywood by storm!"
BG: 
BG: In addition to her real estate, insurance and film ventures, Marie Adler
BG: has also been a popular motivational speaker and given highly
BG: successful seminars on real estate, sales and banking have been
BG: consistently filled to capacity. She has been featured on NBC News and
BG: profiled in Diablo Magazine.

NM: Adler, Max

BG: Born in Queens, New York, Max Adler lived there only a brief year before
BG: his parents moved him to Fountain Hills, AZ. Max and his family
BG: relocated to the larger city of Scottsdale, AZ when he was in high
BG: school where he attended Horizon High, where he maintained a 4.0 GPA,
BG: was the Senior Class Vice President, a member of the National Honor
BG: Society and was involved with the school choir as well as the Drama
BG: Club. Having his pick of colleges to attend, Max decided instead to
BG: pursue his life's dream of acting and he picked up and moved to Los
BG: Angeles at the age of 18.
BG: 
BG: After landing in LA, Max did what most new actors to Los Angeles do for
BG: work; he waited tables and worked as a valet while looking for his big
BG: break. While in LA, Max honed his craft of acting by taking every
BG: acting workshop, acting class and reading every acting book could get
BG: his hands on. Within the first few months of signing with his first
BG: talent agency, Max booked his first real acting role, a PSA Television
BG: Commercial for Montana Meth (an anti-meth campaign), which was directed
BG: by the acclaimed director Tony Kaye. That one commercial got him his
BG: SAG Card. Within weeks of getting his SAG card, he booked a small role
BG: on the Television series What About Brian. With his SAG card in hand,
BG: and his first Television role under his belt, Max started booking more
BG: roles on Television Shows such as Ghost Whisperer, Cold Case, The
BG: Defenders, Demons and Viva Laughlin. He was also booking more
BG: Television Commercials such as KFC, Monster.com, and Sears and can also
BG: be seen starring in the independent horror film Wolf Town.
BG: 
BG: The fall of 2009 would prove to be a career and life-changing time for
BG: Max. He heard that a show called Glee, created by Ryan Murphy, was
BG: looking for actors who could sing and dance and had acting experience.
BG: After being told he didn't fit their idea of any of the current leads
BG: being cast, a few months later, they called him in for a new role they
BG: created of Dave Karofsky, the slushie-throwing school bully. It was a
BG: small role, only two lines and one scene, but Max jumped at the chance
BG: to be a part of this ground-breaking show. By season two of GLEE, Max's
BG: role was expanded and Dave Karofsky is now a regular presence on the
BG: show.
BG: 
BG: In addition to his acting, Max is also active with the Muscular
BG: Dystrophy Association (MDA) as well as the campaign ItGetsBetter.org.

NM: Adler, Stella

DB: 10 February 1901, New York City, New York, USA

DD: 21 December 1992, Los Angeles, California, USA (heart failure)

BG: Stella Adler was born on February 1, 1901, in New York, the youngest
BG: daughter of the Yiddish theater actors, 'Jacob P. Adler' (qv) and
BG: 'Sarah Adler (I)' (qv), who founded an acting dynasty. In addition to
BG: her parents, Stella's family included her siblings
BG: 'Charles Adler (II)' (qv), 'Jay Adler' (qv), Julia and
BG: 'Luther Adler' (qv), all of whom appeared on Broadway. Stella made her
BG: debut at the age of four in the family-owned theater in the play
BG: "Broken Hearts". At the age of 18, she made her London debut as "Naomi"
BG: in "Elisa Ben Avia", in which she appeared for a year before returning
BG: to New York. Stella then spent the next 10 years treading the boards in
BG: vaudeville and Yiddish language theaters throughout North and South
BG: America and Europe. In all, she appeared in 100 plays.
BG: 
BG: Adler was widely acclaimed in the Yiddish theater, but she wanted to
BG: break out of that theatrical ghetto and play a wider variety of roles
BG: on the legitimate stage and in Hollywood. What was constant in Adler's
BG: 83-year-long career was her intense dedication to broadening the level
BG: of artistry in the theater.
BG: 
BG: She made her Broadway debut as a replacement in Carl Kapek's "The World
BG: We Live In". (Her official debut as a member of the original company
BG: was in "The Straw Hat" on Oct 14, 1926). After its run played out, she
BG: joined the acting school run by 'Richard Boleslawski' (qv) and
BG: 'Maria Ouspenskaya' (qv), the American Laboratory. Both Boleslavsky and
BG: Maria Ouspenskaya were former members of the famous Moscow Art Theatre.
BG: 
BG: While married to Horace Eleaschreff, Adler met 'Harold Clurman' (qv),
BG: who would become her second husband and one of the co-founders of The
BG: Group Theatre, in 1924 (They would marry 19 years later). In this
BG: period, she met another future Group Theatre co-founder,
BG: 'Lee Strasberg' (qv), at the Actor's Laboratory when she participated
BG: in classes there in 1928. Along with 'Cheryl Crawford' (qv), Clurman
BG: and Strasberg founded the Group Theatre in 1931. It became arguably the
BG: most influential theater group in 20th century America, at least in
BG: terms of its influence on acting by introducing the teaching of
BG: 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv)'s System to the American stage. Its aim
BG: was the championing of realism and it is credited with bringing
BG: naturalism into the American theater. Clurman and Strasberg invited
BG: Adler to become a founding member of the Group Theatre. The Utopian
BG: political ideals that were central to the idea of the Group Theatre did
BG: not appeal to Adler, nor did the cooperative focus of the company, but
BG: she did join after being promised leading roles and because she
BG: supported Clurman's vision of the theater as an art form. It was with
BG: the Group Theatre that Stella played some of her more acclaimed roles,
BG: including "Sarah Glassman" in "Success Story", "Bessie Berger" in
BG: "Awake and Sing" and "Clara" in "Paradise Lost".
BG: 
BG: In 1934, she took a leave of absence from the Group Theatre and traveled
BG: to Russia to study for five weeks in Moscow Art Theatre, and in private
BG: sessions with the great man himself, 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv),
BG: whose motto was "Think of your own experiences and use them
BG: truthfully." Adler was among few American actors, such as
BG: 'Michael Chekhov' (qv) and 'Richard Boleslawski' (qv) to study
BG: privately with Stanislavsky. In August 1934, she returned from Russia,
BG: and made a presentation of what she learned from Stanislavski, then she
BG: began teaching acting classes to members of The Group Theatre troupe,
BG: including the actors 'Elia Kazan' (qv), 'Sanford Meisner' (qv) and
BG: 'Robert Lewis (I)' (qv). Meisner and Lewis would go on to be the most
BG: influential acting teachers in America after Adler herself and
BG: Strasberg. Kazan, who would go on to become the greatest theatrical
BG: director in 20th century American theater, also had a huge impact on
BG: American acting by championing what became known in the vernacular as
BG: "The Method", which was closely related to Adler's teaching. Kazan's
BG: exposure to 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv)'s System via Adler was
BG: highly influential in his work.
BG: 
BG: Stella Adler, being the most experienced of the Group Theatre actors,
BG: had not accepted Lee Strasberg's idiosyncratic version of
BG: Stanislavski's System, which Strasberg interpreted as "method" and
BG: shifted its goals to memory exercises. "The (memory) emphasis was the
BG: sick one" in Strasberg's "method", said Stella Adler, as it made acting
BG: under Strasberg increasingly painful for her. Feeling uncomfortable
BG: with the Group Theatre members, many of whom were also Communist Party
BG: members, Adler left the company in 1937 to conquer Hollywood. According
BG: to her later student and friend, 'Marlon Brando' (qv), she had a bad
BG: nose job to camouflage her looks, so hell-bent was she on conquering
BG: the movies as she had the stage. She was not to succeed.Adler spent six
BG: years as an associate producer at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, at
BG: which she acted in movies under the name "Stella Ardler."
BG: 
BG: She did not achieve the quality of roles or the acclaim that she had in
BG: the theater, and she eventually returned to the stage in the early
BG: 1940s, acting and directing on Broadway and in London. Adler also began
BG: to teach at German émigré Erwin Piscator's acting workshop at the New
BG: School for Social Research, where she mentored the young
BG: 'Marlon Brando' (qv). She married Clurman in 1943. At its core, the
BG: theatrical experience is rooted in the willing suspension of disbelief,
BG: with an audience willingly ignoring the fact that it is watching a
BG: synthetic entertainment in a highly unrealistic venue. Such is the
BG: power of good theater to draw the audience into the world created upon
BG: the stage that this suspension of disbelief not only occurs, but that
BG: it, as an art form, provides an immediacy that other more "realistic"
BG: forms such as movies or television cannot provide. Adler believed that
BG: "the theater exists 99% in the imagination" and it was this belief that
BG: was the foundation of her philosophy and instruction.
BG: 
BG: Drawing on Stanislavski's System, Adler made it the bedrock of her
BG: technique that an actor's primary concern was with the emotional
BG: origins of the script. An actor (and acting student) must search
BG: between the lines of the script for the playwright's important, but
BG: unspoken, messages. To tap into this vein and bring forth the real
BG: meaning in a character, an actor needed both imagination and the
BG: ability to open oneself up emotionally. Essentially, Adler's method
BG: emphasized that authenticity in acting is achieved by drawing on inner
BG: reality to expose deep emotional experience.
BG: 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv) taught her that "the source of acting is
BG: imagination and the key to its problems is truth, truth in the
BG: circumstances of the play."
BG: 
BG: It was a fortuitous occasion when Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator's
BG: Dramatic Workshop at New York's New School and came into Stella Adler's
BG: orbit. The results of this meeting between an actor and the teacher
BG: preparing him for a life in the theater would mark a watershed in
BG: American acting and culture as it was through Brando that "The Method"
BG: was introduced into the American theater and movies. It would dominate
BG: American acting for more than half-a-century and is still the dominant
BG: paradigm now, over sixty years since Adler tutored Brando.
BG: 
BG: "The Method" as taught by Adler and other Group Theater alumni was a
BG: more naturalistic style of performing, as it engendered a close
BG: identification of the actor with the character's emotions. The
BG: extraordinarily sensitive and intelligent Brando was the ideal student
BG: due to the prodigious talent he could yoke to the harness of technique
BG: that was "The Method". Adler took pride of place among Brando's acting
BG: teachers, and socially she helped turn him from a fairly ignorant
BG: Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and cosmopolitan artist who
BG: one day would socialize with presidents.
BG: 
BG: Aside from acting, Adler directed two plays on Broadway, "Manhattan
BG: Nocturne" during the 1943-44 season, and "Sunday Breakfast" in 1952.
BG: Her last appearance as an actress on the Broadway stage was in the
BG: revival of "He Who Gets Slapped" in 1946.
BG: 
BG: Stella Adler left the faculty of the New School in 1949 to establish her
BG: own acting school, the Stella Adler Theatre Studio (which would be
BG: renamed the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting before taking its final
BG: name, the Stella Adler Studio of Acting). She developed a curriculum
BG: from her wide knowledge and experience, combining her understanding of
BG: 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv)'s System with the techniques and
BG: traditions of the Yiddish theater, The Group Theatre, Broadway and
BG: Hollywood. In addition to acting technique, the school offered
BG: workshops in play analysis, character, and scene preparation; the
BG: students gleaned on-stage experience by performing scenes and plays
BG: before invited audiences. Among the alumni of her school were
BG: 'Marlon Brando' (qv) (chairman of the board of the school until his
BG: death), 'Warren Beatty' (qv) (who has taken over the position),
BG: 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Harvey Keitel' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Adler taught script analysis at Yale for a year and half. Courses for
BG: advanced students and professionals were added to the curriculum of her
BG: own school, including rehearsal technique and script analysis. Due to
BG: her reputation and connections, the school was able to attract
BG: distinguished lecturers, including Sir 'John Gielgud' (qv) and
BG: 'Arthur Laurents' (qv).
BG: 
BG: Stella Adler was a major inspiration to her students. Her mantra was,
BG: "You act with your soul. That's why you all want to be actors - because
BG: your souls are not used up by life". Adler is still, more than a decade
BG: after her death, viewed as one of the foremost influences on
BG: contemporary acting.
BG: 
BG: Adler divorced Clurman in 1960, after 17 years of marriage.
BG: Subsequently, she married 'Mitchell Wilson (I)' (qv), whom she remained
BG: married to until his death in 1973. She did not remarry.
BG: 
BG: Stella Adler died on December 21, 1992 in Los Angeles, California. She
BG: was 91 years old.

BY: Jon C. Hopwood

BG: The one teacher who truly introduced the 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv)
BG: System for acting in America, Stella Adler was committed to the art
BG: like nobody since her first attempts to make a career as an actress in
BG: the 1930s. After a decisive journey to Russia, where Adler personally
BG: studied under 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv), her ideas began to take
BG: form when she related with the Group Theater, some members of which,
BG: such as 'Elia Kazan' (qv), and 'Lee Strasberg' (qv), would found the
BG: Actors Studio in 1947. This year also saw the rising of the System in
BG: the triumphant performance by Adler's favorite disciple
BG: 'Marlon Brando' (qv), as the male lead from "A Streetcar Named Desire"
BG: in its opening night the 3th of December at the 'Ethel Barrymore' (qv)
BG: Theater. Modern acting was born.

DB: 1944, Queens, New York, USA

BG: Ed Adlum was born in 1944 in Queens, New York. He was a writer for
BG: "Cashbox" magazine in 1964 and a guitarist for the short-lived rock
BG: band the Castle Kings, who recorded two flop records on the Atlantic
BG: label. Ed served in the U.S. Army and was a reporter for the "Stars &
BG: Stripes" newspaper while stationed in Germany. Adlum attended Fordham
BG: University in New York. He made his debut as a filmmaker as co-producer
BG: of the groovy hippie soft-core exploitation picture "Blonde on a Bum
BG: Trip." Ed then co-wrote, directed, and produced the delightfully
BG: dreadful low-budget horror splatter howler "Invasion of the Blood
BG: Farmers." Adlum followed this terrifically tacky'n'trashy triumph by
BG: co-writing and producing the even worse "Shriek of the Mutilated,"
BG: which sadly lacks the scuzzy verve of "Invasion of the Blood Farmers."
BG: Ed also has uncredited bit parts in both films. Outside of his
BG: regrettably sparse cinematic oeuvre, Ed Adlum is the publisher of
BG: "Replay" magazine, which he started back in 1975 and still continues to
BG: print to this very day.

NM: Adolescents

BG: The Adolescents were formed in early 1980 by after bassist
BG: 'Steve Soto' (qv) had left 'Agent Orange' (qv). The line-up, at the
BG: time, consisted of frontman 'Tony Cadena' (qv), with 'Steve Soto' (qv)
BG: on bass, 'Frank Agnew (II)' (qv) on guitar, John O'Donovan on guitar
BG: and Peter Pan on drums. Both O'Donovan and Pan left in June. Later that
BG: year, the group released the classic hardcore single "Amoeba" on Posh
BG: Boy Records. The track also appeared on the Rodney on the ROQ
BG: compilation, assembled by L.A. DJ 'Rodney Bingenheimer' (qv).
BG: 
BG: The Adolescents signed with Frontier Records in January 1981 and
BG: recorded their debut album, "The Adolescents", the following month. It
BG: quickly became one of the best-selling California hardcore albums,
BG: behind the 'Dead Kennedys' (qv)' "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables".
BG: Despite this success, Rikk Agnew left the band. He was replaced by
BG: 'Pat Smear' (qv), who would later go on to join the classic
BG: alternative/grunge band 'Nirvana' (qv) during its final years, and then
BG: 'Foo Fighters' (qv), although he had left that band to go solo). The
BG: Adolescents broke up during the fall of 1981 while all members of the
BG: band were involved with their own projects.
BG: 
BG: After no activity at all between 1982 and 1985, The Adolescents returned
BG: in 1986 without 'Casey Royer (I)' (qv), who had just formed a new
BG: project called D.I., and 'Frank Agnew (II)' (qv). The band recorded
BG: their second album "Brats in Battalions", which was released in 1987,
BG: with Sandy Hansen on drums and younger brother Alfie Agnew on guitar.
BG: Also by the end of 1987, Cadena left the band and Soto took over on
BG: lead vocals. They released their third album "Balboa Fun Zone" in 1988
BG: to poor reviews and Frank returned to the fold. Uncomfortable with the
BG: idea of continuing without Cadena, The Adolescents decided to break up
BG: once again in April 1989. Since then, all members of the band had
BG: continued to make music and went on to play in numerous bands such as
BG: D.I., Christian Death, the Flower Leopards, Abandoned, ADZ, Legal
BG: Weapon, TSOL, 22 Jacks and Manic Hispanic as well as providing backup
BG: work for solo projects by 'Joey Ramone' (qv) and 'Jane Wiedlin' (qv).
BG: 
BG: After Soto's post-Adolescents project 22 Jacks became less active by the
BG: end of 2000, the band reunited in 2001, with the "Blue Album" line-up,
BG: for a 20th anniversary tour. 'Casey Royer (I)' (qv) and Rikk Agnew soon
BG: left the band to concentrate on their own projects. Royer was replaced
BG: by former Social Distortion drummer 'Derek O'Brien (I)' (qv). After
BG: numerous guitarists (including Bad Religion/Circle Jerks'
BG: 'Greg Hetson' (qv) and Social Distortion's Jonny Wikersham) were
BG: auditioned to replace Rikk, the band opted to have with Frank's son
BG: Frank Jr. take over where his uncle had left off.
BG: 
BG: As the band continued to tour more actively in most of 2002 and 2003,
BG: The Adolescents felt it was time to start writing new material. The
BG: process took some time since the band members were still involved in
BG: their own projects and work on their first post-reunion album meant a
BG: year long work for The Adolescents. Titled "O.C. Confidential", it is
BG: their first original album in seventeen years (since 1988's "Balboa Fun
BG: Zone"). The album finally arrived in the summer of 2005 and was a
BG: return to their old style back on their first album. The band spent the
BG: second half of 2005 and 2006 on the road. Frank Jr. left to continue
BG: school and was replaced by Matt Beld (Los Infernos, Cadillac Tramps).
BG: Dating back to the time that Soto had teamed up with Beld to produce
BG: the first Los Inernos album, his playing and energy help make an
BG: already powerful live show that much better. The Adolescents are still
BG: together, as of the date of this writing, and still enjoy their
BG: moderate success. The band is now gearing up for their follow-up to
BG: "O.C. Confidential".

DD: 31 October 1979, Stockholm, Sweden

BG: Adolphson grew up in Norrkoeping, where his father was smith. To his
BG: father's disapproval, he began acting in small parts on the local
BG: theatres, particularly Arbis, the worker's theatre. He started an
BG: education to become an engineer in Vaesteraas, but the theatre was the
BG: only thing he was interested in and eventually left school. In 1913 he
BG: joined a travelling theatre company and travelled all around Sweden. He
BG: debuted in Stockholm in 1918 and during the the 1920s he played with
BG: the big names in the Swedish theatre: 'Harriet Bosse' (qv) (whom he
BG: later married), 'Ernst Rolf' (qv), 'Katie Rolfsen' (qv),
BG: 'Tollie Zellman' (qv), 'Erik 'Bullen' Berglund' and
BG: 'Gösta Ekman (I)' (qv) among others. In 1923 he got his first major
BG: role in a movie, _Friaren från landsvägen (1923)_ (qv). In 1929 he
BG: directed _Säg det i toner (1929)_ (qv), one of the first Swedish sound
BG: pictures. This led to an offer from Paramount to direct movies in
BG: Paris, France which he accepted. During the 1930s and 1940s he worked
BG: very hard with movies and theatre, not only because he loved his work,
BG: but also to support an increasing number of ex-wives and children. He
BG: directed 'Ingrid Bergman (I)' (qv) in her first movie,
BG: _Munkbrogreven (1935)_ (qv). Other memorable appearances are

DB: 22 November 1902, Avellino, Italy

DD: 26 November 1971, Ancona, Italy

BG: Organized-crime boss Joe Adonis was born Giuseppe Antonio Doto in the
BG: small town of Montemarano, Italy, near Naples. In 1915 he sneaked
BG: aboard an ocean liner docked in Naples on its way to the US. He hopped
BG: off in Brooklyn, where he had relatives (his cousin was a
BG: 'Vito Genovese' (qv) family capo named Alan Bono). Adonis soon hooked
BG: up with a gang of street toughs who would later become major mob
BG: leaders, including 'Lucky Luciano (I)' (qv). Adonis and Luciano formed
BG: a strong bond, and in the early 1920s the two borrowed money from
BG: fellow gangsters to start their own bootlegging racket. The operation
BG: was quite successful, especially in the theater district on and around
BG: Broadway, and Adonis soon began associating with some of the theatrical
BG: district's most prominent actors, writers and producers. Known to be
BG: excessively vain, he soon changed his name from Giuseppe Doto to Joe
BG: Adonis, supposedly after the Greek god of love. He became an enforcer
BG: for gang boss 'Frankie Yale' (qv) and his partner Lucky Luciano became
BG: a hitman for Brooklyn mob boss 'Giuseppe Masseria' (qv). When Yale was
BG: murdered, Masseria took over his rackets. This soon led to an
BG: internecine bloodbath known as the Castellamarese War, with Masseria's
BG: gang pitted against that of 'Salvatore Maranzano' (qv). Luciano and
BG: Adonis fought on the side of their boss Masseria, but when the tide
BG: starting turning against the gang leader, Luciano held secret talks
BG: with Maranzano about switching sides. When he did, Adonis went with
BG: him. In April of 1931 Adonis, 'Bugsy Siegel' (qv), Genovese and
BG: 'Albert Anastasia' (qv) approached Masseria in a restaurant in Coney
BG: Island and opened fire, killing him instantly.
BG: 
BG: Maranzano now headed the strongest Italian gang in the city, and
BG: organized the other Italian gangs into "families" with himself as the
BG: top boss. Luciano and his allies quickly chafed under Maranzano's rule,
BG: however, and when Luciano learned that the somewhat paranoid Maranzano
BG: had secretly ordered his murder, he decided to return the favor. On
BG: September 10, 1931, several of his gunmen burst into Maranano's
BG: Manhattan office and shot him dead.
BG: 
BG: Luciano now was the "top dog" among the Italian gangs, and revamped
BG: Masseria's organization into a national crime syndicate (sometimes
BG: called The Commission, The Outfit or The Organization), and, as a
BG: reward for helping kill Masseria, gave Adonis a seat on the syndicate's
BG: "board of directors". His territory now encompassed the prime Broadway
BG: and midtown Manhattan areas, and in addition to his bootlegging and
BG: gambling rackets he began buying legitimate businesses. He also began
BG: acquiring a "stable" of politicians and police officers on his payroll,
BG: which he used to protect his rackets and those of his friends and
BG: associates, especially Luciano.
BG: 
BG: However, Adonis' and especially Luciano's power and influence did not go
BG: unnoticed by state authorities. 'Thomas E. Dewey' (qv), then a state
BG: prosecutor and later New York governor, set his sights on Luciano, and
BG: in 1936 obtained a conviction on pandering and pimping charges against
BG: Luciano that earned him a 30-year sentence. The imprisoned mob boss
BG: left Adonis in charge of the Syndicate, with 'Frank Costello (I)' (qv)
BG: in charge of Luciano's family. In 1946 Luciano, in exchange for his
BG: helping the US government during World War II, was released from prison
BG: and deported to Italy. He sneaked out of Italy to meet in Havana, Cuba,
BG: with Adonis and other gang leaders. Unfortunately for him, US
BG: authorities found out about the meeting and "persuaded" the Cuban
BG: government to throw Luciano out of the country and send him back to
BG: Italy. The government also had its eye on Adonis, and when it arrested
BG: 'Abe Reles' (qv), a killer for the mob's enforcement arm called Murder
BG: Inc., it persuaded him to give them a wealth of information on Adonis'
BG: association with the outfit, although not enough to obtain an
BG: indictment against him (Reles couldn't testify, either, having "jumped"
BG: out of the window of a hotel room in which a half-dozen police officers
BG: were "protecting" him).
BG: 
BG: During the famous televised 1950 US Senate Kefauver Commission
BG: organized-crime hearings chaired by Sen. 'Estes Kefauver' (qv), Adonis,
BG: under subpoena, was forced to appear for questioning but refused to
BG: testify, repeatedly invoking his Fifth Amendment privileges against
BG: self-incrimination. In 1951 he was indicted on and pleaded guilty to
BG: charges of running illegal gambling activities and was sentenced to two
BG: years in a New York state prison. When he got out in 1953 a court
BG: declared him an illegal alien and ordered him deported to Italy. He
BG: fought the order in court, but in 1956 finally lost the battle and was
BG: deported. Although both Adonis and Luciano were now living in Italy,
BG: reportedly the two never communicated or saw each other until after
BG: Luciano died in 1962, at which time Adonis attended his funeral.
BG: 
BG: In 1971, during an anti-Mafia operation, Italian police took in Adonis
BG: for questioning. As he was being interrogated he suffered a massive
BG: heart attack, and died on November 26. Although the US government had
BG: declared that he wasn't a citizen, his body was flown back to the US
BG: and he was buried in a cemetery at Fort Lee, NJ.

DB: 8 September 1930, Zurich, Switzerland

BG: Mario Adorf, a tell-tale name indeed. Mario calls to mind the actor's
BG: Italian roots (his father was a Calabrian surgeon) whereas Adorf
BG: reveals his German origins (his mother was a radiologist from
BG: German-speaking Alsace). As for the full name Mario Adorf it echoes to
BG: perfection the international character of this living legend's long
BG: career. Born in 1930, Mario Adorf was still studying drama at the
BG: famous Otto Falkenberg School in Munich when he landed his first role
BG: in the first installment of the "O8/15" series in 1954. It was a small
BG: part but it didn't go unnoticed and got him new roles in German films,
BG: the most remarkable of which being that of Bruno Lüdke, the mentally
BG: retarded serial killer in Robert Siodmak's 1957 masterpiece "Nachts,
BG: wenn der Teufel kam". It earned him his first prize (the German Film
BG: Award of the outstanding young actor of 1958). After this Mario Adorf's
BG: career turned international. His Mediterranean looks, his rugged face,
BG: his dark oily frizzy hair and his volubility made him an ideal villain
BG: in European-made westerns, spy or mafia films. These flicks - made in
BG: the 1960s - were mostly just commercial and Adorf hammed his parts but
BG: he did it so brilliantly that he alone made them watchable. From the
BG: 1970s on, the quality of his films improved and Adorf could lend his
BG: remarkable acting talents to more ambitious works such as "Il Delitto
BG: Matteotti", in which he was a striking Mussolini, or "Die
BG: Blechtrommel", where he was terrifying as a boorish grocer contaminated
BG: by Nazism. The list of great directors he worked with is impressive:
BG: Robert Siodmak, Volker Schlöndorff, Wolgang Staudte, Michel Deville,
BG: Dino Risi, Mikhaïl Kalatozov, Luigi Comencini, Peter Fleischmann, Billy
BG: Wilder, John Frankenheimer, Claude Chabrol, Fassbinder... Likewise he
BG: served many a great author, either in the theatre (Shakespeare,
BG: Tennessee Williams, Richard Nash) or the big or small screen (Grass,
BG: Böll, Schnitzler, Heny Miller, Joseph Conrad, Gorky, Patrick
BG: Süskind...). He also sang and wrote books (five novels and one memoir).
BG: Hyperactive for more than fifty-five years now, Mario Adorf, still in
BG: fine form at the age of seventy-eight, is still ... hyperactive!

HT: 5' 1"

BG: Renee Adoree was born Jeanne de la Fontein in Lille, in
BG: Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France on 30 September 1898. Renee had what one
BG: could call a normal childhood. Her background is, perhaps, one of the
BG: most difficult to find information on any actress in existence. What we
BG: do know that her interest in acting surfaced during her teen years with
BG: minor stage productions in France. By 1920, Renee had gained the notice
BG: of American producers and came to New York. Her first film before US
BG: audiences was The Strongest that same year. That was to be it until
BG: 1921 when she appeared in Made In Heaven. Renee wondered if she had
BG: made the right move by going into motion pictures because of two minor
BG: roles in as many films. Finally MGM saw fit to put her in more films in
BG: 1922. Movies such as West Of Chicago, Daydreams, Mixed Faces, and Monte
BG: Cristo saw her with meatier roles than she had had previously. Renee
BG: was, finally, hitting her stride. Better roles to be sure, but still
BG: she was not of first class caliber yet. All that changed in 1925 when
BG: she starred as Melisande with John Gilbert in The Big Parade. The
BG: picture made stars out of Renee, Gilbert, and Karl Dane. Based on the
BG: films success, Renee was put in another production that same year in
BG: Excuse Me. It lacked the drama the previous picture but was
BG: well-received. In a plot written by Elinor Glyn, Renee starred as
BG: Suzette in Man and Maid. This was Renee's most provocative role yet and
BG: she was fast becoming one of the sexiest actresses on the screen. In
BG: 1927, Renee starred as Nang Ping in Mr. Wu along with her sister Mira.
BG: The film was a hit with co-stars Ralph Forbes and Lon Chaney, but it
BG: was Renee's character which carried the film. After several more films,
BG: her career was slowing down. She appeared in a bit part in Show People
BG: later that year. The following year she had an uncredited bit role in
BG: His Glorious Night. Re-discovered by First National Pictures after
BG: being released by MGM, she appeared in The Spieler (1928) where she was
BG: a struggling carnival manager trying to overcome the dishonesty that
BG: went on in her organization. Ill with tuberculosis, she retired. Less
BG: than a week after her 35th birthday, Renee died in Tujunga, California
BG: on October 5, 1933.

DB: 3 March 1903, Naugatuck, Connecticut, USA

DD: 13 September 1959, Hollywood, California, USA (heart attack)

BG: Adrian Adolph Greenburg, born in Naugatuck, Connecticut, March 3, 1903,
BG: to Gilbert and Helena (Pollack) Greenburg. He began his professional
BG: career while still attending the New York School for Fine and Applied
BG: Arts by contributing to the costumes for "George White's Scandals" in
BG: 1921. He is credited for that production by his created name of Gilbert
BG: Adrian, a combination of his father's first name and his own. He
BG: transferred to NYSFAA's Paris campus in 1922 and while there was hired
BG: by 'Irving Berlin (I)' (qv). In the fall of 1922 he returned to New
BG: York and began work on Berlin's 1922-1923 edition of "The Music Box
BG: Revue". Adrian continued to work on the Berlin reviews as well as other
BG: theatrical and film projects.
BG: 
BG: His big film break was designing costumes for 'Mae Murray' (qv) in her
BG: first M.G.M. film, _The Merry Widow (1925)_ (qv). He was then hired by
BG: 'Natacha Rambova' (qv) to design for the independent films of her
BG: husband, 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv). In mid-1925, after designing
BG: costumes for the prologue of "The Gold Rush" at Grauman's Egyptian
BG: Theatre in Hollywood, Adrian was hired by 'Cecil B. DeMille' (qv) to
BG: become head of the wardrobe department at his new studio. When DeMille
BG: moved to M.G.M. in 1928, Adrian moved there also. When his DeMille
BG: contract expired, Adrian signed with M.G.M. and remained with that
BG: studio until 1942.
BG: 
BG: He opened his own very successful couture business and continued to do
BG: some films until such time as his business expanded, with a salon in
BG: New York as well as Beverly Hills. His fashions were sold in department
BG: stores around the U.S. and he was the recipient of the 1944 Coty Award
BG: for Fashion. He also received a Lord & Taylor award for his work on
BG: _Marie Antoinette (1938)_ (qv) in 1938 and a special award from
BG: Parsons, the successor to NYSFAA. His last film was
BG: _Lovely to Look at (1952)_ (qv). He retired from the fashion industry
BG: in 1952 after a heart attack. He relocated to Brazil with his wife
BG: (since 1938) actress 'Janet Gaynor (I)' (qv) and their son, Robin. He
BG: returned to the U.S. to do "Grand Hotel", a musical with
BG: 'Viveca Lindfors' (qv) and 'Paul Muni (I)' (qv) and his last career
BG: credit was the costume design for the Broadway musical "Camelot". He
BG: was working on this production when he died of a heart attack on
BG: September 13, 1959. Adrian never received an Oscar.

NM: Adrian, Ian J.

HT: 6' 1"

BG: Ian Adrian is a filmmaker based in New York City. He was born in Kansas
BG: City, Missouri, though he always points out that his parents lived on
BG: the Kansas side of the city. He graduated in film from Columbia
BG: University in 2006 and started his production company, Stained Glass
BG: Pictures, while working on the TV show "Live From Lincoln Center", as
BG: well as the occasional MTV show and some movie work.
BG: 
BG: Growing up, Ian's mother, Samara moved him and his brother, Orion often.
BG: Consequently, by the time he was fifteen Ian had lived in Kansas City,
BG: Kansas, Manhattan, Kansas, Albequerque, New Mexico, Stuart, Florida,
BG: Melbourne, FL, and Raleigh, North Carolina.
BG: 
BG: His films tend to be fantastical in nature, such as the award-winning
BG: "Phantoms of the Night", a love story between two ghosts, the animated
BG: "Space Vikings", and "American Jewels", the story of a group of student
BG: activists who must recover a certain portion of George Washington's
BG: anatomy in order to stop a scientist from performing monkey
BG: experiments.
BG: 
BG: After graduating high school in Raleigh, NC, Ian tried to follow what he
BG: perceived as a traditional career path. Office work at places like IBM
BG: and the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management proved to be
BG: involving. So, he went to New York to study film and, currently, he is
BG: still living in New York.
BG: 
BG: With his biggest "hit" being "Phantoms of the Night", which won the
BG: "Best Animated Film" award at the Ivy Film Festival and has been a
BG: feature selection at several other film festivals, Ian has decided to
BG: pursue the niche which animation holds. "There's a lot less competition
BG: for animated films at festivals or in general, because a lot fewer
BG: people can do it or think to do it...What's great about animation is
BG: that you can do anything or go anywhere without having to worry about
BG: cost." This philosophy led Ian to create his current work, "Space
BG: Vikings" about a group of hapless marauders who travel to different
BG: planets but never quite succeed.
BG: 
BG: "Space Vikings", a series pilot/concept was Ian Adrian's last known
BG: project.

RN: Iris Adrian Hostetter

DB: 29 May 1912, Los Angeles, California, USA

DD: 17 September 1994, Hollywood, California, USA (aftermath of earthquake)

HT: 5' 4"

BG: Sugar, Pepper, Pearl, Sunny, Goldie, Bubbles, all those are nicknames
BG: borne by petite actress Iris Adrian in several of the 160 movies she
BG: made. With such names, don't expect to see her playing Joan of Ark or
BG: Electra but it remains that all these pet names reflect her winning
BG: femininity, its sweetness, its spiciness, its radiance. What's more
BG: their funny overtones are telltale signs of Iris Adrian's own quick
BG: witty sense of humor. Sexy yes, but with a sharp tongue. This aspect of
BG: her personality helped her to evolve and last, changing from the roles
BG: of blonde chorines or waitresses or, on the wilder side, of
BG: streetwalkers and other gangsters' molls to colorful bit parts in
BG: comedies with Abbott and Costello, Jerry Lewis and Elvis Presley. She
BG: ended up playing almost exclusively for Walt Disney productions before
BG: retiring at the respectable age of 82. Though she never achieved star
BG: status she could easily have if the circumstances had been favorable.
BG: For she steals scenes in a lot of movies provided of course her role is
BG: fleshed out sufficiently. She was excellent, for instance, in more than
BG: one poverty row crime movies. Don't miss her in 'Gold Diggers of 1937',
BG: 'Go West' (with the Marx Brothers, 1940), 'Lady of Burlesque' (1943),
BG: 'The Paleface'(1948), 'Once a Thief' (1950) and 'The Errand Boy' (with
BG: Jerry Lewis, 1961).

BG: Grandiose Irish stage, film and television character player Max Adrian,
BG: a noted classical performer and musical comedy revue star with a highly
BG: distinctive voice and "old school" acting style, was born Max Bor on
BG: November 1, 1902, in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland. The son of
BG: Edward Norman Cavendish Bor and wife Mabel Lloyd Thornton, Max studied
BG: at the Portora Royal School and showed early interest in the performing
BG: arts. An intermission singer/dancer at a silent film theatre, he made
BG: his stage debut in the chorus in 1925 and proceeded to gain experience
BG: on the West End.
BG: 
BG: Following extensive repertory experience, Adrian (who was occasionally
BG: billed as Max Cavendish) enjoyed his first transcontinental stage hit
BG: with "First Episode", which toured throughout England and later
BG: transferred to Broadway in 1934. He went on to find wide personal
BG: success with his roles in "Troilus and Cressida" and "The Doctor's
BG: Dilemma" toward the end of the decade. Joining the Old Vic company in
BG: 1939, he scored as "The Dauphin" in "Saint Joan", then continued
BG: supremely with 'John Gielgud' (qv)'s company at the Haymarket Theatre
BG: in the mid-1940s as "Puck" in "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "Osric" in
BG: "Hamlet" and "Tattle" in "Love for Love".

BG: A founding member of both the Royal Shakespeare Company and, much later,
BG: 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s National Theatre, Adrian earned widespread
BG: admiration for his work on the lighter side as a singer/comedian on the
BG: post-WWII musical revue stage. Many were produced by his long-time
BG: companion Laurier Lister (1907-1986). He also later performed
BG: eloquently, if outrageously, in one-man shows about
BG: 'George Bernard Shaw' (qv) and the lesser successful "Gilbert and
BG: Sullivan".
BG: 
BG: Following his revue success, the often-bespectacled actor traveled to
BG: America in 1956 to appear in 'Leonard Bernstein' (qv)'s operetta,
BG: "Candide", on Broadway. Adrian stayed and pursued a career working in
BG: such summer stock productions of "Pygmalion" as Alfred as Doolittle,
BG: "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme" as "Jourdain", "The Merchant of Venice" as
BG: "Shylock", and "The School for Scandal" as "Sir Peter Teazle", but
BG: never established a strong footing. He returned to London in 1959 to
BG: appear in 'Noel Coward' (qv) "Look After Lulu!", which later was taken
BG: to Broadway.
BG: 
BG: In the early 1960s, Adrian became a member of 'Peter Hall (I)' (qv)'s
BG: nascent Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in Stratford-upon-Avon, wherein
BG: he appeared in "As You Like It", "Twelfth Night" and "Troilus and
BG: Cressida", as well as the non-Bard productions of "The Duchess of
BG: Malfi", "The Devils" and "The Hollow Crown". He also was a founding
BG: member of Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic from 1963,
BG: wherein he supported 'Peter O'Toole (I)' (qv) "Hamlet" as "Polonius".
BG: He also went on to appear in "Saint Joan", "Uncle Vanya", "The
BG: Recruiting Officer" and "The Master Builder".
BG: 
BG: Less renowned for his work on film, Adrian's made his debut in 1934 with
BG: two films: _The Primrose Path (1934)_ (qv) and
BG: _Eight Cylinder Love (1934)_ (qv). Film highlights during this earlier
BG: period came with his roles in the historical pieces _Kipps (1941)_ (qv)
BG: and _Penn of Pennsylvania (1942)_ (qv) and as "The Dauphin" in
BG: Olivier's classical masterpiece,
BG: _The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France (1944)_ (qv)
BG: (aka Henry V). Post-war films included lesser parts in
BG: _Her Favorite Husband (1950)_ (qv), _Pool of London (1951)_ (qv) and
BG: _The Pickwick Papers (1952)_ (qv). In later years, he showed some minor
BG: flash in _Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965)_ (qv),
BG: _Funeral in Berlin (1966)_ (qv) and _The Deadly Affair (1966)_ (qv),
BG: and capped his cinematic career as a favorite actor of visionary
BG: director 'Ken Russell (I)' (qv) and his mesmerizingly bizarre films
BG: _The Music Lovers (1970)_ (qv), _The Boy Friend (1971)_ (qv) and
BG: _The Devils (1971)_ (qv). He fared much better on TV with several
BG: Shakespearean and other classical roles, notably as a delightful
BG: "Fagin" in "Oliver Twist", impressive 'Benjamin Disraeli' (qv) in
BG: "Victoria Regina", and as composer "Fredrick Delius" in "Song of
BG: Summer".
BG: 
BG: Dying of a heart attack in 1973, the prolific stage actor, survived by
BG: his partner, was paid tribute by such luminaries as
BG: 'Laurence Olivier' (qv), 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and revue co-star
BG: 'Joyce Grenfell' (qv).

NM: Aeone

RN: Aeone Victoria Watson

DB: 1959, Liss, Hampshire, England, UK

BG: Aeone (pronounced ay-own) was born in 1959 in Liss, Hampshire as Vikki
BG: Watson. Shortly after her birth the family moved to Emsworth - her
BG: family still runs an antique shop in Petworth, Sussex - , where she
BG: grew up. As a child she took song and dance lessons, and then went on
BG: to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. At first, she
BG: wanted to become an opera singer, but soon realized that her voice was
BG: more suited to popular music.
BG: 
BG: Some very early success in the Eurovision Song Contest - winning fourth
BG: place in Gothenburg, Sweden performing the 1985 UK entry "Love Is"
BG: written with Jimmy Kaleth sent her packing to the United States and
BG: full circle returning to her Celtic roots. She did very well in terms
BG: of touring, television shows and live work, yet a difficult lifestyle
BG: coupled with the commercial direction of the material drove her to
BG: emigrate to the United States.
BG: 
BG: Initially teamed with writer/producer/engineer Jeff Silverman, in 1991
BG: she released an 11-track debut album, entitled Window To A World, that
BG: pioneered a blend of Celtic sounding music with a pop feel combining
BG: fiddle, banjo and mandolin.
BG: 
BG: After releasing her debut album, she moved on to scoring for television
BG: shows, composing for Witchblade, "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" on
BG: Discovery, Santa Barbara and Team: Knight Rider. She also composed for
BG: several movie trailers, including The Messenger, John Q, Behind Enemy
BG: Lines, The Shipping News, Enough, Life Or Something Like It, Showtime
BG: (film), Rat Race, Finding Forrester, Saving Silverman, Lucky Numbers,
BG: Lovers Of The Arctic Circle, One Night At McCool's, At First Sight,
BG: Down To Earth, Instinct (film) and Disturbing Behavior.
BG: 
BG: Then, in 1999, she released a special mp3-album, called Aeone (album).
BG: Combining numbers from her debut album and several new ones, the album
BG: became quite popular on mp3.com. A few months later, her second studio
BG: album was released, The Woman's Touch. The album contains a broad range
BG: of song styles, each with clear ethereal vocals, at times rising above
BG: full ambient grooves. Ballads are offset by strong dance rhythms as
BG: well as several highly accessible tunes. After the release, Aeone
BG: picked up composing for a while before she started working on her third
BG: album. In between she found the time to sing one of the title songs for
BG: the TNT miniseries Mists Of Avalon, composing and writing the song I
BG: Will Remember You Still. A year later, the third album, Point Of Faith,
BG: was released.
BG: 
BG: Among the more remarkable happenings in her career, Aeone particularly
BG: recalls her debut in Zimbabwe, when she sung one song and the band
BG: played another, and a television appearance in which she was almost
BG: flattened by the American heavy-weight pop singer Meat Loaf.

QU: * About her album "Point Of Faith" - The key message of this album is
QU:   "connection." The idea of finding a connection with your deep self and
QU:   through that a connection to your God and realizing that whatever we do
QU:   or wherever we go, we are all connected with each other and to nature.
QU:   In a way, the themes of the songs are also simply about existence and
QU:   the journey through life itself, the art of just "being" -the things
QU:   that we deeply feel and sometimes are unable to express because they
QU:   are too painful and also the wonder of it all.

BG: Aeschylus is considered by some as the greatest writer ever to walk the

BG: from Athens. The greatest festival in his hometown was the Elefsinia
BG: Mysteria, a dramatic imitation of nature's awakening in spring.
BG: Aeschylus is the founder of the classic Ancient Greek drama and was the
BG: first to clad his actors in impressive costumes on stage. His heroes
BG: were greater than life, always decent, even in their most dramatic
BG: moments. In his plays he was questioning everything, including the
BG: gods. People would walk for days to see his new play. He was leading an
BG: unhappy life, however, constantly seeking answers to the mysteries of
BG: life and death. He spent his last few years in the western Greek
BG: colonies of Sicily.

BG: Benjamin Geza Affleck was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley,
BG: California, USA but raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. He was
BG: born to parents Tim Affleck, a social worker, who is now divorced from
BG: Ben's mother Chris Affleck (nee' Boldt) a school teacher. Ben also has
BG: a younger brother, actor 'Casey Affleck' (qv), who was born in 1975.
BG: Ben wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember and his first
BG: acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the
BG: PBS mini-series _"The Voyage of the Mimi" (1984)_ (qv). It was also at
BG: that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor,
BG: 'Matt Damon' (qv). They played little league together and took drama
BG: classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and
BG: small television appearances including
BG: _Hands of a Stranger (1987) (TV)_ (qv) and
BG: _"The Second Voyage of the Mimi" (1988)_ (qv). He made his big
BG: introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in
BG: _Dazed and Confused (1993)_ (qv). After that, he did mostly independent
BG: films like 'Kevin Smith (I)' (qv)'s _Mallrats (1995)_ (qv) and
BG: _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) which were great for Ben's career, receiving
BG: renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But
BG: the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer
BG: and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment
BG: with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned
BG: down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable
BG: supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided
BG: to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So,
BG: after finishing the script for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), they
BG: gave it to their agent 'Patrick Whitesell' (qv), who showed it to a few
BG: Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castlerock. It was great
BG: news for the two but Castlerock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the
BG: control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend
BG: 'Kevin Smith (I)' (qv) who took it to the head of Miramax who bought
BG: the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December
BG: of 1997, _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was released, making the two
BG: unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and
BG: won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film
BG: marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first
BG: time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through
BG: grueling auditions constantly. He chose such roles in the blockbusters
BG: _Armageddon (1998/I)_ (qv), _Shakespeare in Love (1998)_ (qv) and
BG: _Pearl Harbor (2001)_ (qv). With these hits to his credit, Hollywood
BG: can't seem to get enough of Ben, with directors wanting him in their
BG: movies and companies wanting his screenplays. His inspirational story
BG: of hard work and amazing climb to the top has brought him what he
BG: deserves and Ben Affleck has shown no sign of slowing down.

OW:   My Fuel", with 'Sarah Silverman' (qv) to lobby Congress.

QU: * [on the celebrity women the tabloids falsely link him to] Sometimes it's
QU:   'Britney Spears' (qv), and sometimes it's 'Carrie Fisher' (qv). I can't
QU:   tell if I have a Lolita complex or an Oedipus complex.
QU: * I feel like fame is wasted on me.
QU: * [on tabloid coverage of his life] It feels like being in a soap opera
QU:   that you were unwittingly cast in and you have no choice about it. I
QU:   get to watch my life like everyone else and think. "I can't believe
QU:   they did that". And, for whatever reason, you become less special for
QU:   movie audiences. It cheapens the brand if you want to look at it in a
QU:   really crass sense. But I figure it has to go away at some point.
QU:   Eventually someone will come along and have a sex tape or someone will
QU:   play grab-ass with some kids and I'll be off page one.
QU: * [answering a 'Chris Matthews (VII)' (qv) question about why Hollywood
QU:   actors sometimes presume to be sophisticated about politics] Everyone's
QU:   entitled to express their political beliefs. I don't presume to tell
QU:   anybody who to vote for. I am comfortable telling people what my
QU:   opinions are. But you have to look also to the media, where you have a
QU:   vast majority of the loudest and most influential political voices in
QU:   America media from people who came from the entertainment world. You
QU:   have 'Rush Limbaugh' (qv), was a radio disc jockey.
QU:   'Bill O'Reilly (I)' (qv) came from _"Inside Edition" (1988)_ (qv).
QU:   'Michael Moore (II)' (qv)'s a filmmaker. 'Al Franken (I)' (qv) was on
QU:   _"Saturday Night Live" (1975)_ (qv). The line is increasingly blurred
QU:   between news and entertainment. Secondarily, the media's also shoving
QU:   celebrities down our throats all the time. As a person, I'm much more
QU:   interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and
QU:   important than who they're dating or what clothes they're wearing or
QU:   some other asinine, insignificant aspect of their life.
QU: * [when asked by 'Chris Matthews (VII)' (qv) what he thought about
QU:   'Whoopi Goldberg' (qv)'s remarks at a 'John Kerry (III)' (qv) fund
QU:   raiser that resulted in her being fired as a spokesman for SlimFast] I
QU:   wasn't there. I went to the Los Angeles fund raiser. I wasn't in the
QU:   one in New York. I think when you have somebody -- you know, if you did
QU:   a rock concert that was a benefit and 'The Who' (qv) played their music
QU:   or 'The Rolling Stones' (qv), you'd expect to get, you know,
QU:   "Satisfaction" or "My Generation." When you hire Whoopi Goldberg,
QU:   you're going to get her brand of humor. And I think there is a fine
QU:   line, and you have to be a little bit mindful. And I, for one, am not
QU:   going to do any scatological jokes or puns about the president's last
QU:   name on your show, mostly for that reason. But I also think I expect a
QU:   different code of behavior maybe from comedians who have made a career
QU:   with a certain kind of comedy than I do from, oh, say, the Vice
QU:   President of the United States [referring to Vice President
QU:   ['Dick Cheney' (qv), who told Vermont Sen. 'Patrick Leahy' (qv) to "Go
QU:   fuck yourself" on the floor of the Senate], who used this vulgar
QU:   language, you know, to a senator and was sort of unapologetic about it.
QU:   So I think the Republicans hitting her [Whoopi] too hard for that is a
QU:   little bit hypocritical.
QU: * [to 'Dee Dee Myers' (qv), when asked how people react to his campaigning
QU:   for candidates he supports] Well, I mean, to be perfectly honest,
QU:   probably the most effective things that celebrities do for political
QU:   candidates is raise money. You know, that's something that you can do.
QU:   And unlike, say, fund-raisers sponsored by -- you know, engineered by
QU:   insurance companies or oil companies, at least what you can say for
QU:   celebrities is they're not expecting, you know, deregulation of their
QU:   industry in return. So that's one of things that I'm, I've been able to
QU:   do and to try to help them do it. Other than that, you know, I've lived
QU:   this sort of strange, sometimes unpleasant, but mostly very lucky life
QU:   that's involved lately a lot of media attention. And one of the things
QU:   that feels good to me to do is to try to steer that in a direction of
QU:   something more significant and at least be -- try to create some
QU:   political dialogue. And that's satisfying. Some people react to me
QU:   kindly, and others don't. That's sort of the nature of politics."
QU:   [Myers follows up: "Do you think it's kind of a risk for your career as
QU:   movie star to get in bed with one party?"] "Unequivocally. Absolutely.
QU:   And I think that's why, you know, actually, people say, Well, you see
QU:   all these celebrities. To my mind, you see very, very few. Most feel
QU:   like, and probably correctly so, that to be identified with one side of
QU:   the ideological fence or other risks alienating a segment of your
QU:   audience that may like your movies, may want to buy your tickets, and
QU:   in fact, may make it more difficult for them to suspend their disbelief
QU:   when they go see you in a movie because they have you closely
QU:   identified with something else. For me, part of that is already
QU:   compromised, and it's also something that's interesting enough for me,
QU:   and I don't care quite so much about that kind of image that I'm able
QU:   to do it. But I think a lot of people shy away from it, and many
QU:   celebrities you see who've gone out there, tried to be active, have
QU:   gotten pretty beaten down, you know? And so I think there is a risk,
QU:   yes." [July 27, 2004, quoted in the MSNBC Transcripts]
QU: * [told by 'David Gergen' (qv) that many were surprised by how well he
QU:   "elucidated"] Well, David, I think I benefit from the same thing that
QU:   helped 'George W. Bush' (qv) in the [2000] debates, which is
QU:   tremendously low expectations.
QU: * [when asked why he thought 'George W. Bush' (qv), after hearing that New
QU:   York was under attack on Sept 11, remained in a Florida classroom,
QU:   doing nothing, for several minutes] It's obviously very disturbing
QU:   footage. On the one hand, you see a reaction on a man's face that he is
QU:   clearly pained and shocked. I probably did the same thing sitting on my
QU:   chair. I was completely freaked out and a little devastated. On the
QU:   other hand, one does hope that in one's leaders, that they have the
QU:   instinct to spring into action, to take some action or make the
QU:   appearance of taking some action. And I was disappointed to see that he
QU:   didn't do that, although I don't entirely hold it against him because,
QU:   frankly, I was as shocked and devastated as he was. Although I think
QU:   flying around in Air Force One for 11 hours before coming back and
QU:   landing in the White House was probably less forgivable.
QU: * When I got to L.A., my family had me go to dinner with this guy who had
QU:   been acting here for 20 years. He gave me this big lecture and said,
QU:   "You know how much money I made in 20 years of acting? Eight thousand
QU:   dollars. And I'm a carpenter." He was just really unhappy and it was
QU:   depressing. Then he got really stoned and I went home and felt sick. I
QU:   think it was just morbid fear. I was 18. That fear stays with you so
QU:   intensely and you're constantly just getting turned down for what you
QU:   think of as the most vapid, stupid kind of paycheck,
QU:   _"Baywatch" (1989)_ (qv) things, and you think, "Jesus, if I'm not good
QU:   enough for this, then I'm not going to make it". This town is too hard,
QU:   and people were always telling me, "You're too big, you're too tall,
QU:   you can only play bullies and you will never be a leading man.
QU: * [on his struggles as an actor before becoming successful] I lived all
QU:   over the place. I lived in Hollywood, then I moved. ['Matt Damon' (qv)]
QU:   and I got money from _School Ties (1992)_ (qv), and we blew it all in a
QU:   couple of months. We made $35,000 or $40,000 each and thought we were
QU:   rich. And we were shocked later on to find out how much we owed in
QU:   taxes. We were appalled: $15,000! What? But we rented this house on the
QU:   beach in Venice and 800 people came and stayed with us and got drunk.
QU:   Then we ran out of money and had to get an apartment. It was like
QU:   everything was exciting. So we lived in Glendale and Eagle Rock and we
QU:   lived in Hollywood, West Hollywood, Venice, by the Hollywood Bowl, all
QU:   over the place. We'd get thrown out of some places or we'd have to
QU:   upgrade or downgrade depending on who had money.
QU: * It's like Christmas: it's all advertising, and the first rule of selling
QU:   somebody something is to make them seem inadequate. Make them feel like
QU:   they need it. Like fabric softener. Nobody really needs fabric softener
QU:   and yet, all of a sudden, you feel like a jackass if you don't have
QU:   fabric softener, so people buy it. And that's how Christmas has become,
QU:   because 50% of all retail sales happen in December. You are bombarded
QU:   with this stuff - money will make you happy, and keeping up with the
QU:   Joneses. Obviously that stuff doesn't make you happy, otherwise there
QU:   wouldn't be all these unhappy rich people. They'd all be happy in their
QU:   jacuzzis and OK, some of them are.
QU: * God help me if I ever do another movie with an explosion in it. If you
QU:   see me in a movie where stuff is exploding you'll know I've lost all my
QU:   money.
QU: * Sure, I suffered a lot. But it's not like the end of the world and it's
QU:   not who I am. I lead quite a pleasant life and I'm able to divorce a
QU:   perceived reality from my actual experience of life.
QU: * [on his career path and choice of movies] I have definitely noticed that
QU:   I care less about certain things. Other actors are like, "You can't do
QU:   that", or "You can't do this. This will position you in the wrong way."
QU:   That's not my thing. And obviously so, because you can see I don't
QU:   craft or cultivate my career.
QU: * I've finally learnt how to say, "No comment". To appear in the tabloids
QU:   is a real learning curve and a steep one at that. You had better learn
QU:   quick or you get burnt.
QU: * [about the New York Yankees' principal owner] You know
QU:   'George M. Steinbrenner III' (qv) is the center of all evil in the
QU:   universe.
QU: * I'm not known for having great relationships with ex-girlfriends, but
QU:   I've been able to continue one with ['Gwyneth Paltrow' (qv)] that's
QU:   really valuable.
QU: * I'm always described as "cocksure" or "with a swagger", and that bears
QU:   no resemblance to who I feel like inside. I feel plagued by insecurity.
QU: * I remember back when I was a kid there was a comic strip called Plastic
QU:   Man. His body was elastic and he could make his extremities as long as
QU:   he wanted. As a youngster I didn't fully appreciate. But I'm now
QU:   thinking Plastic Man was probably pretty popular with the ladies.
QU: * I hate the whole reluctant sex-symbol thing. It's such bull. You see
QU:   these dudes greased up, in their underwear, talking about how they
QU:   don't want to be a sex symbol.
QU: * I kinda see my current position like this: "Here's your five minutes in
QU:   the toy store, so you gotta do all the good movies you can before
QU:   'Chuck Woolery' (qv) rings the bell".
QU: * When I look up at the screen and see myself I always have to laugh. Not
QU:   because I think I'm doing a horrible job, quite the contrary, I just
QU:   feel it's so surreal to feel like one person can entertain so many at
QU:   one time.
QU: * I just feel like sometimes I'm a force to be dealt with. My talents are
QU:   sometimes overused and also sometimes underused. It's not easy being
QU:   me.
QU: * I never know what my next move will be in Hollywood. It's such an
QU:   unpredictable town. People get jaded and lost and I've been able to
QU:   stay a float. I think the next logical step in my career would be to
QU:   start my own filmmaking empire like ['Harvey Weinstein' (qv)] and
QU:   ['Bob Weinstein' (qv)] did so many years ago. I think if only the
QU:   unions weren't so strict in Boston, I'd set up shop there and make
QU:   films of a certain quality you don't see represented these days. I'm
QU:   full of ideas and dreams.
QU: * [asked by 'Dee Dee Myers' (qv) if he thought it was risky for his career
QU:   to be identified with a particular political party] Unequivocally.
QU:   Absolutely. And I think that's why, you know, actually, people say,
QU:   "Well, you see all these celebrities". To my mind, you see very, very
QU:   few. Most feel like, and probably correctly so, that to be identified
QU:   with one side of the ideological fence or other risks alienating a
QU:   segment of your audience that may like your movies, may want to buy
QU:   your tickets, and in fact, may make it more difficult for them to
QU:   suspend their disbelief when they go see you in a movie because they
QU:   have you closely identified with something else. For me, part of that
QU:   is already compromised, and it's also something that's interesting
QU:   enough for me, and I don't care quite so much about that kind of image
QU:   that I'm able to do it. But I think a lot of people shy away from it,
QU:   and many celebrities you see who've gone out there, tried to be active,
QU:   have gotten pretty beaten down, you know? And so I think there is a
QU:   risk, yes.
QU: * I think we don't need to know anything about a political figure's sex
QU:   lives. I guess 'Matt Drudge' (qv) did break [the
QU:   'Monica Lewinsky' (qv)] story, if you think that's a story worth
QU:   breaking. I think it was a story that bogged down the wheels of
QU:   government for two years. I don't care, personally. Some people say
QU:   that's a fair reflection of a candidate's character. I don't. I'm not
QU:   voting for your sexual predilection, I'm voting for your policy
QU:   positions.
QU: * Newspapers have gotten lazy and gotten nervous and started sourcing from
QU:   blogs, and that, I think, is dangerous. Because you could pick any
QU:   blog. I could start a blog tomorrow and write, 'I heard that so-and-so
QU:   is an alien' -- a lot of false stories got started and got some
QU:   currency because they were placed in blogs.
QU: * Part of the blogging culture that's good is it's made the traditional
QU:   press much more nervous. They've become more accountable, because they
QU:   are sensitive to what the bloggers are going to say. Most Americans
QU:   don't spend the day waiting for what the bloggers are going to say. The
QU:   mainstream media sweats it, because for the first time they are
QU:   actually accountable to someone who is going to write about them and
QU:   their work. Which has a real strong impact on the mainstream media and
QU:   how they work.
QU: * I was no longer in control of my life. I thought I wanted certain
QU:   things, but I didn't. I got lost. I felt suffocated, miserable and
QU:   gross. I should never have gone down that route or got sucked in to all
QU:   the publicity. I was typecast as myself. Too many people weren't
QU:   getting past what they read about me. That was damaging. I can tell
QU:   from experience it's bad for you, and bad for your career. So I took a
QU:   break, went away for a while and let things calm down. (Claiming that
QU:   his high-profile engagement with 'Jennifer Lopez (I)' (qv) damaged his
QU:   career.)
QU: * I finally decided to quit smoking when I found out I was going to have a
QU:   child. That was the thing that sort of put it over the top for me. I
QU:   decided to go to a hypnotist. You sit in a chair and the hypnotist sips
QU:   water and just talks to you for an hour, and explains how nicotine is
QU:   poison. All of a sudden, I thought, 'This is asinine that I've been
QU:   doing this to myself for all these years.' My last cigarette was on
QU:   November 10th, 2005, and I feel a huge difference in my health now that
QU:   I don't smoke. I feel like I'm in better shape than I was five years
QU:   ago.
QU: * [on turning down the offer to direct Superman:
QU:   _Man of Steel (2013)_ (qv)] - The one benefit of having done all kinds
QU:   of movies as an actor is, you learn the pros and cons of being tempted
QU:   to do a really big movie because it costs a lot of money.
QU:   
QU:   With "Superman", I think they're going to do a great version.
QU:   'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv) is brilliant and they've got a great
QU:   director for it.
QU:   
QU:   ... Also there are a lot of guys ahead of me on the list to do epic
QU:   effects movies.
QU: * I'd love to do [direct] something like _Blade Runner (1982)_ (qv), but a
QU:   lesson I've learned is to not look at movies based on budget, how much
QU:   they'll spend on effects, or where they will shoot. Story is what's
QU:   important.

QU: * [on the responses to his being vegan] My family would be supportive if I
QU:   said I wanted to be a Martian, wear only banana skins, make love to
QU:   ashtrays, and eat tree bark. My mom has a good way of engaging me in a
QU:   conversation about the choices I make, listening, being objective and
QU:   open-minded, and respecting those choices so long as they don't put me
QU:   in danger. For a while, every meal was the third degree, but when she
QU:   couldn't refute any of the thousands of good reasons--my health, simple
QU:   compassion, the health of the planet, etc., etc.--for being a vegan,
QU:   she conceded and now is very conscious of what food she makes when I am
QU:   around--and, I believe, when I am not around. She is lovely. My father
QU:   never blinked. He is for the most part unflappable. In a good way. Live
QU:   and let live--unless you are being an asshole. He will privately mock,
QU:   ridicule, judge, etc. But, hey, who's gonna cast the first stone? For
QU:   people who have been through it, made changes, had curve balls thrown
QU:   at them, it is easier to digest change and digest change in other
QU:   people. Change only scares the small-minded. The small-minded and me.
QU:   No, I'm only kidding. It only scares me--I mean, the small-minded. I
QU:   think if I gave my dad a five-minute rundown on the advantages of
QU:   veganism, I could convert him without too much trouble. I'll do it next
QU:   time I see him. Maybe. I'm not much into the converting business,
QU:   though.
QU: * I don't think journalists have much impression of me. I haven't really
QU:   done all that many interviews, partly by choice, and partly because no
QU:   one's been all that interested.
QU: * [on his working relationship with brother 'Ben Affleck' (qv)] It was
QU:   easy mostly because we kind of just spoke the same language and were
QU:   very comfortable saying to each other, "I think that's a terrible idea
QU:   . . . " or "That's a great idea but what if . . . ?" We could sort of
QU:   build on each other's excitement. We had a kind of shorthand.
QU: * (About breaking his arm) The doctor operated for six hours and saved my
QU:   arm. I mean, I can't speak for my arm. It might have rather been set
QU:   free.
QU: * I believe veganism can be beneficial for the individual and the world,
QU:   and of course the animal, but belief is like laying in the dark with
QU:   someone and telling them you love them and hearing nothing back. So
QU:   I've never had the confidence to get on a soapbox and tell someone else
QU:   what to do

BG: also fought as a semi-professional boxer. So good was he, he even
BG: fought for the British Heavyweight title. However, it was his
BG: experience of bare knuckle fighting that brought him to the attention
BG: of the producers of _The Big Man (1990)_ (qv) starring the
BG: pre-_Schindler's List (1993)_ (qv) 'Liam Neeson' (qv). He was initially
BG: asked to advise on the 'sport' but after several meetings it was
BG: decided to cast him in a prominent role, as Cutty Dawson. Since then,
BG: he has generally typecast as the archetypal Scottish hard man, but has
BG: also done comedy in BBC's Screen One production,
BG: _"Screen One" (1985) {Down Among the Big Boys (#5.3)}_ (qv), where he
BG: played a character with the name of Bungalow!
