[Maria has disguised the airmen as waitresses, so René mimes to them
  that they must not go upstairs with the Germans]
Flying Officer Carstairs: [turning to Fairfax] What was all that
  about?

[repeated line]

[to Herr Flick and von Smallhausen]
Officer Crabtree: Good moaning, Herr Flock. And von Smellhorsen.

[Officer Crabtree is standing inside the pissoir, using it, when it
  is demolished by Edith driving Lieutenant Gruber's little tank]
Officer Crabtree: [climbing out of the rubble] There is obviously no
  piss for the wicked.

[the airmen have come downstairs, minus their mustaches, dressed as
  serving girls]
Flying Officer Fairfax: Carstairs, you're standing like a tart again.
[Carstairs drops his arm to his side]
Edith: [looking the airmen up and down] No one will suspect them.
  They look just like the staff.
René: Edith, the Germans *take* the staff upstairs from time to time.
  If they took these two upstairs, do you not think that their
  suspicions will be aroused?
Yvette Carte-Blanche: We are much more attractive. They will take us.
René: And suppose there is a rush?
Flying Officer Carstairs: What are they saying, Fairfax?
Flying Officer Fairfax: I've no idea - it's all in French.

[the airmen have entered the cafe disguised as pallbearers, when a
  squad of Germans arrive]
Flying Officer Carstairs: What's going on?
Michelle Dubois: [English accent] Jerries. Keep quite or you'll be
  shot.

  clobber for it.

[repeated line]
Capt. Hans Geering: [shouts] 'tler!

[Edith has devised a plan to help get the airmen to the P.O.W. camp
  via the graveyard]

  big enough to shoot us all against.

Officer Crabtree: My lips are soiled.

Yvette Carte-Blanche: What is happening?
Maria Recamier: We were both aroused by the banging.
Edith: I too was aroused by the banging.
Roger Leclerc: I was aroused when I saw the girls with the candles.

Monsieur Alfonse: Perhaps Madame Edith will make me the happiest man
  alive...
René: I thought you wanted to marry her?

Herr Flick: I have a box of sharp needles somewhere. [opens a drawer]
  Ah, here they are.
Helga: What have you in mind, Herr Flick?
Herr Flick: I have an excellent gramophone and many old records of
  Hitler's speeches. They are quite amusing.
Helga: Hitler's speeches quite amusing?
Herr Flick: Played at double speed, he sounds like Donald Duck.

[Hans has accidentally run over Herr Flick's car with a steamroller]
Herr Flick: This is very serious! The Gestapo is only insured for
  third party!

  in, you take your right boot out, you do a lot of shouting and you

[cut off by telephone]

René: [to wife Edith] Youuuuuu stupid woman!

[repeated line]
René: Oh, 'eck!

Herr Flick: I will not be reporting this incident to Berlin. I do not
  wish to look a right 'nana.

Capt. Hans Geering: Do you not see that if you kill him with the pill
  from the till by making with it the drug in the jug, then you need
  not light the candle with the handle on the gateau from the
  chateau!
René: Simple plans are always the best.

René: But you won't shoot me?
Col. Von Strom: That goes without saying.
René: I would feel better if you said it, just the same.

[repeated line]
René: [to Madame Fanny] You silly old bat!

Col. Von Strom: [about Hitler] Do you think he has a screw loose?

  Lieutenant Gruber and Colonel Von Strohm trying to escape, dressed
  as British airmen]
General Erich von Klinkerhoffen: [in German] Impersonating British

  happened to you?
Captain Hans Geering: Um... The resistance took me away.
Colonel Kurt von Strohm: [to Rene and the others] He's in the hands
  of the resistance. They'll be wanting a ransom. [Into the
  microphone] Hans, can you give us your present position?
Captain Hans Geering: Uh... In the markets, overlooking Picadilly
  Circus [several corroborating background noises follow]
Colonel Kurt von Strohm: What happened?
Captain Hans Geering: I'm afraid the war is over for me, Colonel. The
  resistance mistook me for a British airman and sent me back to
  England.
Colonel Kurt von Strohm: Then you must escape and get back here, as
  soon as possible!
Captain Hans Geering: Um... That will not be easy, Colonel. You see,
  I do not have my spectacles.
Colonel Kurt von Strohm: Hans, what am I going to tell the general?
Captain Hans Geering: Well, um... tell him that the food is very good
  and the British think they're going to win. Over and out!

  knobs, but doesn't get a reply] Hans! [Realizing that his friend is
  gone for good] Hans... [credits roll]


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Communists in the Cupboard (#5.14)}

  Communist girls would have shot us out of hand. How can I ever

Private Helga Geerhart: Who would have the temerity to do such a
  wicked deed?
Herr Otto Flick: Someone who hates me.
Private Helga Geerhart: Everybody hates you.

René Artois: You are covered in cobwebs. Have you been standing still
  again?


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Enter Denise (#5.5)}
[René and Mimi are embracing each other]
Mimi Labonq: I cannot hear your heart.
René Artois: That is because you are listening to my appendix.

[Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen are playing poker]
Herr Otto Flick: How dare you try to bluff a senior Gestapo officer
  with a pair of tens? I have won.
Herr Engelbert von Smallhausen: Am I allowed to see your hand, Herr
  Flick?
Herr Otto Flick: No. You have lost. I get your Gestapo pen and pencil
  set.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Feathers (#5.17)}
[about Monsieur Alphonse, who they believe to be dead]

Capt. Hans Geering: Thank you, Colonel. I see you have polished your
  head.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Herr Flick's Revenge (#2.6)}
Col. Von Strom: You are exceeding your authority. The Gestapo has no
  jurisdiction over senior officers of the German Army.
Capt. Hans Geering: Or junior officers.
René: What about café owners?
Capt. Hans Geering: They can do what they like with them.

Monsieur Alfonse: [René has returned to the café disguised as a
  resistance girl] Thank God he is safe. The bravest transvestite in
  all of France.

[Helga has come to the cafe to talk to René, when a clattering noise
  is heard from outside]
Helga: What was that?
René: Just the phantoms falling over the dustbins.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Lines of Communication (#7.5)}
Michelle Dubois: I have good news. Officer Crabtree has found the

Edith Artois: What about the smell?
René Artois: I expect the pigs got used to it.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Mines Away! (#5.20)}
[Von Smallhausen has been squashed by the bell of the church]
Herr Engelbert von Smallhausen: I have a very sore head.
Herr Otto Flick: That is the least of your problems. You have been
  squashed well below the minimum height required for members of the
  Gestapo.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Parade of Prams (#5.12)}
[Michelle gave René a suicide pill which he doesn't want to use]

# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Pigeon Post (#1.2)}
Col. Von Strom: [to René] If you do not get us the uniforms back, you
  will be shot!
Capt. Hans Geering: Up against the wall, with guns.

Michelle Dubois: To avoid suspicion, you will be disguised as a small
  boy.
Maria Recamier: But why can't I be disguised as a small girl?
Michelle Dubois: Because you *are* a small girl.

[first lines]
René Artois: My name is Rene, this is my cafe. But at the moment, my
  life is one big problem. You see, I have to be nice to the Germans.
  They are my customers, they are winning the war, so if I am not
  nice to them, they will shoot me. I have to be nice to The
  Resistance.
Edith Artois: Otherwise they will shoot him for being nice to the
  Germans!
[his wife Edith leaves]
René Artois: I have to be nice to my wife because if she finds out
  I'm having an affair with Yvette, she will shoot me. If Yvette
  finds out I'm having an affair with Maria, she will shoot me. Now,
  Otto Flick, the Gestapo officer, is having dinner in the back room.
  Upstairs are two German officers in their underwear because I have
  borrowed their uniforms to help two British airmen to escape. The
  pianist over there is in fact a forger for The Maquis. And the
  German officer at that table...
[Camera pans over to Lt. Gruber, who smiles at Rene]
René Artois: ...fancies me. And it is only Tuesday.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Post-Matrimonial Depression (#5.7)}
René Artois: Excuse me, is this the secret hideout of the Gestapo?
Herr Engelbert von Smallhausen: It was, until now.

[to a communist girl, while being disguised]
René Artois: Can't you see that I am my father?


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Pretty Maids All in a Row (#3.5)}
Officer Crabtree: [Edith has just pretended to shoot two British
  airmen, dressed as hookers, and the given the gun back to Hans] I
  was pissing by the door when I heard two shats.
Officer Crabtree: [Gesturing to Hans] You hold in your hind a
  smooking goon. You are clearly the guilty potty.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Reds Nick Colonel (#1.6)}
Col. Von Strom: You must be very careful with the painting of the
  Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies.
Capt. Hans Geering: It is our retirement fund.
Col. Von Strom: OUR retirement fund? I found it!
Capt. Hans Geering: Yes. But I know about it.

René: May I tell you a little legend, Colonel? It is said that these
  champagne glasses were modeled on the bosom of Marie Antoinette.
Capt. Hans Geering: They should have modeled them on Helga's bosom.
  We would have got a bigger drink.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Rescuing the Airmen (#6.4)}
Edith Artois: René, Michelle told me horrible news. Now, when I heard
  it I looked ten years older.
René Artois: You always look ten year older.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {Six Big Boobies (#2.1)}
Col. Von Strom: If you will tell me the names of the Resistance
  leaders, I will see that you are protected.
René: Protected? Against who?
Col. Von Strom: Me.
René: But, colonel, I do not know their names! They are mostly girls.
  They wear McIntoshes and little short white socks and berets like
  any other French girl. And they only reveal themselves at night.
Capt. Hans Geering: Like any other French girl.
Col. Von Strom: I wish I could get my hands on them.
Capt. Hans Geering: We both do.

[the airmen are unhappy about being dressed as nuns]
Flying Officer Carstairs: Fella keeps trying to chat us up.
Michelle Dubois: [English accent] Didn't they suspect the moustache?
Flying Officer Carstairs: If you think mine's big, you should see the
  Mother Superior's.

[inspecting the paintings of the Fallen Madonna]
Lieutenant Hubert Gruber: This is an early van Klomp...
Herr Otto Flick: How do you know?
Lieutenant Hubert Gruber: When he was taller, he signed his paintings
  further up.

[Gruber has just warned Rene that Captain Bertorelli will be
  proposing to Edith, and Michelle tells her she must accept for The
  Resistance]

  about the bush, Madame Edith.
Edith Artois: [Resigned] I accept.
Captain Alberto Bertorelli: I come here today to ask for your hand in
  marriage.
Edith Artois: I accept.
Captain Alberto Bertorelli: Together we have a wonderful-a time
  together! We go for walks in the moonlight! We kiss with the
  passion under the stars!
Edith Artois: I accept!
Captain Alberto Bertorelli: Then we come home, and count-a the
  takings from the till. I go on my bended knees, please say yes!

Michelle Dubois: Will she talk?
René: Incessantly. But not about anything important.

[Herr Flick has arrived to see the Colonel]
Helga: Do you have an appointment?
Herr Flick: I am Otto Flick of the Gestapo.
Helga: Oh, you don't need an appointment.

René: Good evening, Herr Lieutenant. What is your pleasure?
Lt. Hubert Gruber: I would like a cognac, if you please?
René: Maria, cognac for the officer. If you would like to, eh
Lt. Hubert Gruber: Why not, why not?
René: [René puts down the cognac. Lt. Hubert Gruber reaches into his
  pocket and produces a cigar. René mistakes Lt. Hubert Gruber for
  Leclerc] I - I - I expect you would like a light?
Lt. Hubert Gruber: Thank you, you're very kind.
René: I have no matches.
Lt. Hubert Gruber: Then why do you ask me if I would like a light?
René: I'm very sorry.
Lt. Hubert Gruber: If you have no matches... if you have no matches,
  take mine. I have a spare box.
René: Are you one of them?
Lt. Hubert Gruber: Well, it... it was very lonely on the Russian
  front.
Roger Leclerc: A cognac, if you please?
René: Maria, a cognac.
Roger Leclerc: [Roger Leclerc reaches into his pocket and produces a
  cigar. Lt. Hubert Gruber notices and lights Leclerc's cigar. Roger
  Leclerc to René] Do you have a light?
Lt. Hubert Gruber: What do you want a light for? I just lit it.
Roger Leclerc: Well, I don't want a light, I just wondered... if he
  had a light.
René: I have no matches.
Lt. Hubert Gruber: I've just given you some matches!

# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {The Execution (#1.4)}
[Fairfax and Carstairs are lying in Madame Fanny's bed]
Flying Officer Fairfax: If the Jerries find us dressed in civvies, it
  would take a lot of explaining.
Flying Officer Carstairs: If they found us in bed with each other, it
  would take even more explaining.
Flying Officer Fairfax: Carstairs, are you a grammar-school boy?
Flying Officer Carstairs: [shocked] How do you know?
Flying Officer Fairfax: You're wearing your socks in bed.

Col. Von Strom: Helga. How did you get up to that little window?
Helga: I am standing on a peasant.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {The Flying Nun (#4.4)}
Gen. Von Klinkerhoffen: Unfortunately the Führer has more confidence
  in his astrologers than in his generals. He is waiting for an omen
  to start the invasion.
[Mimi, dressed as a nun and attached to a kite, floats past the car.]
Col. Von Strom: Would he regard a flying nun as a good omen?


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {The Funeral (#1.5)}
René: Yes, we are both from Nancy. We're just a couple of Nancy boys.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {The Gateau from the Chateau (#2.7)}
Capt. Hans Geering: René, that is the jug with the drug.
René: After all that has happened, I could use a little aspirin.

[Rene has covered the gâteau for the Kaiser's birthday with sand]
Gen. Von Klinkerhoffen: You fool, what do you think you are doing?
René: I did this in memory of the day that the Kaiser was buried.

Capt. Hans Geering: Do you not see? That if you kill him with the
  pill from the till by making with it the drug in the jug, you need
  not light the candle with the handle on the gâteau from the
  château.
René: Simple plots are always the best.

[Michelle regards the snooker table in the back room of the café]
Michelle Dubois: What is the biggest break you've had on this table?

  bulb.

[Von Klinkerhoffen has ordered the Colonel to woo Madame Edith]

  the Russian Front?
Capt. Hans Geering: She's a good cook.
Col. Von Strom: [starting to smile] Oh, yes. I'd forgotten that.

[Edith has suggested that Rene strap dynamite to himself in order to
  blow up the General]
Edith: You will be buried as a great hero of France.
René: First you will have to scrape me off the wall.

Col. Von Strom: [discussing the General] So far, he has only
  discovered the tip of the iceberg.
Capt. Hans Geering: You haven't stolen a whole iceberg, have you?

[Colonel von Strohm reveals that he has discovered a plot by the
  Resistance]
René: Perhaps they were just trying to kill General von Klinkerhoffen
Capt. Hans Geering: We're all trying to kill General von
  Klinkerhoffen.


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {The Goose and the Submarine (#6.3)}
[Von Klinkerhoffen accuses Flick and von Smallhausen of withholding
  information]
General Erich von Klinkerhoffen: Clearly, you are giving us these
  ludicrous descriptions because you wish the Gestapo to take the
  credit for the capture of the Resistance people. I'm warning you;
  you'll be kept under very close observation. You will not be able
  to go to the bathroom without me knowing about it. Meanwhile,
  Berlin will be informed of your perverse antics and your
  recalcitrant demeanour, which has exacerbated the quid pro quo,
  vis-à-vis inter-departmental relationships.
Herr Otto Flick: Come, von Smallhausen. To our dictionaries!
[Flick and von Smallhausen limp away]


# "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982) {The Nicked Knockwurst (#3.1)}
[Yvette has brought more hot water for René's bath.]
Yvette Carte-Blanche: The old boiler is in a terrible state.
René: I do not know why I married her in the first place.

[on telephone]
Herr Flick: Flick the Gestapo.... No, I said *Flick*, the Gestapo!

  bit of driving he says, he's only done a fucking blag, with Mervin
  Reese!

Paul Clarke: There's only one word for that, Shiv: naive!


# "'Til Death" (2006) {Clay Date (#1.17)}
[first lines]
Joy Stark: Phone!
Eddie Stark: We're not here! Don't answer that!
Joy Stark: What if it's an emergency?
Eddie Stark: Who would call us in an emergency? You're panicky and
  I'm too big to fit in small spaces!

[last lines]
Steph Woodcock: Sorry I got so crazy about this whole thing. I guess
  I get a little nuts when people challenge me. I think it's because
  someone else is doing all the work. Maybe if we did something
  together I wouldn't become such a lunatic. I was thinking, maybe we
  could sponge-paint the dining room together. Doesn't that sound
  like fun?


# "'Til Death" (2006) {Come Out and Play (#2.3)}
[first lines]
Eddie Stark: Ah, can't wait.
Dad: Oh, you folks are gonna have to move, this our table.

  [laughs] That is just adorable!

[last lines]
Eddie Stark: I made it! It went in! It went in, it went in!

# "'Way Out" (1961)
Roald Dahl: I have a maiden aunt in Norway who was actually rolled
  out of bed onto the floor three nights running, by a ghost. But
  then she lives in what was once a very old trysting place. About
  400 years ago, they bricked up a naughty girl in the wall of that
  room: that sort of thing always produces a ghost. If your wife is
  extremely delicate, and you tickle her to death, that will produce
  a ghost, too - so you have to be careful. We have another one for
  you next week at the same time. Good night and sleep well.


# "'Way Out" (1961) {The Croaker (#1.6)}
[first lines]
Announcer: And now, your host, Roald Dahl.
Host: How are you? And how is your love life, you ladies? Because
  whatever happens, you should always try to realize that men are not
  nearly so preoccupied with the opposite sex as most women would
  like to think. Above all, you see, man is a colossal egotist, far
  more enamored with his own self than he is with females. And that,
  quite obviously, is why women are always having to doll themselves
  up attractively to attract his attention. To me the behavior of the
  male human is very much like that of a male frog. The frog,
  whenever he feels a trifle amorous, calls to his female by blowing
  out his dewlap and letting it go with a burp. The female comes
  hoppity hop hop over to his side and waits eagerly, but by then the
  male has become so engrossed with the business of blowing his own
  horn that he's forgotten all about her and she actually has to
  nudge him several times before he turns to embrace her.

Host: Our play, strangely enough, is called "The Croaker" by Phil
  Reisman Jr. and, of course, is Way Out.

Mr. Rana: Do you always go around breaking into people's houses
  without knocking?
Jeremy Keeler: Sure! Otherwise nobody would let me in. People don't
  like me much.

Cora Tench: Don't just sit there, Fred; go out and look for him.
  After all, he's your dog.
Fred Tench: What do you mean 'my dog'? I only bought the mutt so you
  two could bark at each other and leave me in peace.

Mr. Rana: Listen, boy, when you grow up - if you grow up - you'll be
  exposed to all the idiotic theories of that monumental fraud called
  Darwin. According to him, mankind developed out of something like
  this and then he said it evolved up through the jellyfish, the
  flatworm, the fishes past the amphibians to the birds and the
  reptiles.
Jeremy Keeler: Reptiles? You mean like snakes? They're cool!
Mr. Rana: They're the greatest abomination on Earth, boy. The mortal
  enemy of frogs! They're not even entitled to a place in evolution.

Mr. Rana: All things beyond the frog are just mutations of the frog.
  Look here, how can you improve upon perfection.

Sergeant McGoogan: Let me check this description again, Mrs. Tench.
  Collar yellow, eyes narrow and close together, weak chin, drools in
  the car. Well, that's a description of the missing dog!
Cora Tench: That's a description of both missing dogs, Sergeant.
  Look, all I know two nights ago, my idiot husband went next door
  looking for his idiot mutt and I haven't seen hide nor hair of
  either one since.

Sergeant McGoogan: You said he didn't pack a bag. We checked the
  railroad station, the bus depot and the taxi companies and there's
  no withdraw from your bank account.
Cora Tench: I certainly hope not.
Sergeant McGoogan: And we checked all the bars and taverns, the
  bottom of Mill Creek, the sand and gravel pit and homes of three
  ladies whose husbands travel extensively. Was he insured?
Cora Tench: You mean did I do away with him? Not yet.

Sergeant McGoogan: [to Jeremy] Out out out! I can hardly wait until
  you're 18.
Sergeant McGoogan: [to Cora] Sometimes you can hit 'em when they're
  15.

Cora Tench: He had just told me that you had transformed Fred into a
  frog.
Mr. Rana: Oh, he did, did he?
Cora Tench: Imagine that. With a wave of your magic wand... or don't
  they use those anymore?
Mr. Rana: Oh, quite obsolete, quite obsolete, Cora. Now days, we
  would use a chemical decoction; something colorless, tasteless,
  with perhaps just a faint odor of pond water, but disguised in the
  heavier scent of, say, whiskey.

[last lines]
Host: Are frogs happier than people? This is the question just posed
  by the play you've just seen. But several good friends of mine, all
  of them frogs, have told me that the price of people's legs in the
  better frog's restaurants, is ridicuously high at the moment and
  this for one thing is causing much unhappiness. We'll have another
  story for you next week at the same time. Good night and sleep...
  well.

Cora Tench: My husband couldn't disappear without a trace. He's too
  irritating.

  Subaru who can't even stay online. It will be such a hit with

Subaru: Please don't come any closer, I don't know what you are

  you understand? You see I don't like people like you.
Kaochin: Grr.

FBI Agent Nicole Scott: A guy wants out of a woman's room, he'll do
  anything.

FBI Agent Nicole Scott: Oh, that's right, you think she's hot.

FBI Agent Nicole Scott: Okay look, calm down.
Jess Mastriani: Easy for you to say, you were not grabbed by a hand
  from the grave!
FBI Agent Nicole Scott: Neither were you, it was just a vision.
Jess Mastriani: No! They're not visions until you know they're
  visions, when it happened it was a hand from the grave. [sighs] It
  felt really cold.
FBI Agent Nicole Scott: Was there anything else?
Jess Mastriani: I don't want to talk about the vision. I want, I want
  a job in the food service industry. Something involving French
  fries and paper hats and no hands coming out of the ground!
FBI Agent Nicole Scott: Maybe it has something to do with the case,
  Jess.
Jess Mastriani: And maybe I was at Janey's funeral, who I couldn't
  stand, but she was shot and killed, so I feel guilty, and so now
  she's going to haunt me forever! Maybe that, Nicole.

Assistant Director John Pollock: The panel is on the wall's outside.

Assistant Director John Pollock: So...?
Jess Mastriani: It's against the rules. Sir.
Assistant Director John Pollock: Don't screw with me, Agent. Go turn
  it off. [Jess is silent. Pollock rolls his eyes] All right, come
  here. [he pulls Jess directly in front of the camera, squares her
  shoulders and straightens her hair. He lines her up against the
  lens carefully, so that they can both be seen on film]
Jess Mastriani: This angle work for you? Sort of three quarters. This
  your good side?
Assistant Director John Pollock: It's fine, sir. [he looks up at the
  camera, then back at Jess.]
Jess Mastriani: Okay. I, John Pollock, Assistant Director of the FBI,
  order you to turn this camera off and leave me alone with the
  suspect.
Assistant Director John Pollock: Sir, it's against regulations. And
  it compromises the suspect's rights.

  I miss Brooklyn, huh? Especially the Summers...
Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: I don't want to hear your birthday,
  I don't want to hear your favorite ice cream, I don't want to hear
  how your dog Skippy died, and I certainly don't want to hear about
  your bedroom life!
Deputy Rico Amonte: How did you know my dogs name was Skippy?
Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: Are you pulling roots?
Deputy Rico Amonte: Sir, I do not pull roots, especially when it
  comes to Skippy. Yellow lab, we had him for fifteen years...
Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: How do you say shut up in Italian?
Deputy Rico Amonte: [confused] What?
Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: How do you say shut up in Italian?

Deputy Jackson: Layne... bad, bad girl.
Deputy Rico Amonte: Sir, it wasn't her fault. I was telling her how
  frustrated I was at not getting anywhere with you. I dragged it out
  of her. She was looking out for you.

Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: Do you pray?
Deputy Rico Amonte: At Easter, sometimes at Christmas if I want

Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: You better pray hard tonight that
  you never see me again.

Deputy Rico Amonte: I'm not saying I didn't get along with my dad. We
  got along... like a New York cabbie and the English Language.

Deputy Rico Amonte: I remember when I saved up everything I earned to
  buy my mom a lilac bush when she was sick. I just knew that she'd
  get better if she had her favorite flower beside her. I went to the
  nursery, I bought the plant, she died that afternoon. Some matters
  are just out of our hands.

Deputy Rico Amonte: Of course they will.
Man in jail: Good. He was like my family.
Deputy Rico Amonte: You didn't kill him, did you?
Man in jail: No. He just up and died. He had a weak heart. I was his

Deputy Rico Amonte: You know sir, when I was a kid the only time I
  listened to my father was when he wasn't yelling.

McDowell: I never would have pulled the trigger if that's what you're
  after.
Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: I know you wouldn't, I could see it
  in your eyes. One thing you should know, though, when you go to
  such lengths to make a statement is never contradict that statement
  before you've made it.
McDowell: What do you mean?
Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: Calling names can do serious damage
  to people, just as it did to your grandchild.
McDowell: I know.
Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes: And you went in there to teach those
  kids a lesson they'd never forget. Then when a janitor shows up you
  mock him, his station in life, and call him a name.

Cadpig: Oh, I hope Roger picks me! That trophy matches my inner glow.
Spot: Who cares about the trophy? I just wanna bring honor to Dearly
  Farm.
Rolly: Roger isn't picking a chicken, Spot. He's gonna choose a
  dog... with a nose for bones... like me.
Lucky: Dream on, guys. Roger has only one favorite, and we know who
  that is.
Cadpig: Oh, forgive me, chosen one. And if it weren't for my total
  commitment to world peace, I'd kick your sorry little...
Spot: Hey, where are you going, Tripod?
Tripod: Gotta start practicing for the contest. Gotta dig, gotta pump
  up, gotta feel the burn! You guys coming?
Lucky: Nah, I've got... shall we say... connections.
Tripod: No pain, no gain.

Cadpig: He's brave.
Rolly: He's fearless.
Lucky: He can do anything!
Spot: He's just a dog.
Lucky: He's not just a dog! Go-Go's my hero!

Cruella de Vil: Memo to myself: Give up gambling. It's wrong...
  especially if you lose money.

Cruella de Vil: Come back here, you! You owe me more than a dollar!
  Ooh! I mustn't run in heels!

Roger Dearly: Oh, Lucky. You know I can't stay mad at you. You're my
  favorite.
Cadpig: Gee, it's enough to make you want to toss your kibble.

[repeated line]
Tripod: No pain, no gain.

Lucky: Roger's choosing Tripod over me? We gotta get him to a doctor.
  Maybe he's a clone! His body's been snatched in an alien invasion!

Lucky: Why didn't Roger pick me?
Spot: Hmm, let me take a stab at this. Because Tripod practiced?
  Because he worked hard? Because he's better?
Lucky: Who says he's better? I never even tried.
Spot: Ah! I think we've identified the problem.

[Lucky and Tripod get attacked by a sling of mud. The mud puts
  Tripod's hair into a swirl]
Lucky: That's a good look for you.
Tripod: Careful, Lucky. You don't want to break a nail.

Cadpig: You're not suffering from shot anxiety, are you, Lucky?
Spot: Lucky? Afraid of a little shot? Ha! Lucky and I laugh at shots!
  We have shots for breakfast! Afraid? Please! [Lucky faints]
Cornelia: Oh, Spot? Time for your chickenpox shot! [Spot faints]
Cadpig: Come on, Lucky. Mr. Vaccine has a needle with your name on
  it.
Lucky: You guys go ahead. I'm gonna hide. Uh, I mean... I'd better go
  round up the others. Yeah! I'm gonna go round up the others.

Rolly: [translating a barking code] Lamb strayed from flock...
  runaway... last seen... riding a cloud?
Spot: That's "heading for town".

Lt. Pug: What I want out of each and every one of you is a
  soft-hearted search by the book: No barking, no mocking, no begging
  for hand-outs.
Lucky: Whoop-de-doo.

Rolly: I don't remember this ever happening to Thunderbolt.
Cadpig: But this is Luckybolt. The danger never stops.
Lucky: Just a minor setback.

Lucky: I can't wait to meet Thunderbolt!
Spot: I hear he dyes his muzzle.

Spot: You know how many people are maimed every year on
  merry-go-rounds?
Lucky: Uh... none?
Spot: Exactly! A tragedy is long overdue.

Spot: Guys, help me! I'm... blue!
Cadpig: Oh, Spot, these little side trips to Unhappy Land have to
  stop.

Spot: [crushed by a drum] Pollution hurts.

Cruella de Vil: I am simply sensational in my new commercial! Don't
  you agree? [pause] Of course, you do. I pay you to agree.
Horace: [to Jasper] She pays you?

Cruella de Vil (Left Head): This is an environmental disaster.
Cruella de Vil (Right Head): What she said.
Cruella de Vil (Left Head), Cruella de Vil (Right Head): Memo to
  myself: No longer pollute local rivers and streams that directly
  effect me.

Lucy: My Hiccup Hole is in beautiful condition. No more pollution...
  [the pups splash in]... except for the spotted variety.

Cruella de Vil: What a ravishing day, almost as if I designed it
  myself. Fresh air, sparkling water... humongous glowing blue
  tsunami of *slime*?

Cadpig: You know what they say: When one door closes, another one
  opens.
Lucky: Hey, they were right, Cadpig!

Lucky: Hold onto this liquorice with your teeth, Rolly. Don't eat it.
Rolly: I could, right?
Lucky, Cadpig, Spot: No!
Rolly: Okay, but hurry! I'm weakening!

Cadpig: Don't hold onto the past, Lucky. Let it go. Move on. Catch it
  on cable!

Mr. Puffin: Before I make the public announcement, I wanted to
  congratulate you for having the designer of the year working for
  you.
Cruella de Vil: Darling, I don't work for me. I *am* me.

Cruella de Vil: Memo to myself: Replace sawdust in the dog food with
  dirt. It's even cheaper.
Man: But Ms. De Vil, aren't you concerned about the nutrition?
Cruella de Vil: Oh, who cares? They're dogs! And they're owners are
  too stupid to know the difference.

Rolly: Who could be responsible for such monstrosity?
Cruella de Vil: You're fired!
Spot: Why do we bother to ask?

Cadpig: Let's not poo-poo our positivity. Just think about the
  competition.

Cecil B. DeVil: What better actress would advertise new chicken
  flavor Kanine Krunchies than a chicken?
Spot: Chicken flavor? What do they take me for? Some kind of *sicko*?

Lucky: Rolly, what happened when you took that poll?
Rolly: What happened when I took the poll? The fence fell down!

Cadpig: I always try to be supportive, but... GET OFF ME NOW!

Lucky: Holy Chimmichanga!

Rolly: Spot, why don't you just follow us out this way?
Spot: Uh, because I'm stuck?

Rolly: This was a lot more fun than just sitting around watching
  TV... even the Gravy Channel!
Cadpig, Lucky, Spot: *Especially* the Gravy Channel!

Cadpig: Some people don't know when to quit.

Lucky: We'll all be on TV! Which is my best side?
Spot: You're sitting on it.

Princess: I must have "sucker" branded on my derriere.

Cadpig: You are a hero. Just like on TV.
Lucky: Some hero. Nothing like the way I planned it. The bad guy beat
  me at every turn, and look at how it ended! I got plucked like a
  chicken! No offense, Spot.
Spot: None taken... Baldy!

Lucky: What was I thinking? I don't have a chance!
Cadpig: There is no such thing as chance, Lucky. It's all up to
  destiny, and today, my name is "Destiny"!

Lucky: If I were Chief Firedog, I'd declare a hydrant for every dog!
  I'd be the envy of all my fellow canines...
Cadpig: Attention, Flight Director Lucky. Your ego trip has been
  cancelled.

Lucky: Hey, who shut it off?
Spot: Sorry, I thought it was over.
Rolly: What's it matter? All that's left was a preview of tomorrow's
  show.
Cadpig: And we know what *that* will be like: a little gratuitous
  violence, a little male bonding, a big explosion at the end.
  KABLAM! They're all the same.
Lucky: I still wanted to see it. Thunderbolt's the only excitement I
  get around here.
Spot: You looking for excitement? Rumor in the henhouse says that
  somebody, possibly Naomi, laid an egg... with two yolks.
Rolly: Hey, hey! I dug up a shoe... open-toed!
Lucky: Someone put me out of my misery! I wasn't meant to live the
  life of a farm animal. I need adventure, excitement, like
  Thunderbolt! I should be battling insidious villains, facing
  fur-raging danger, boldly going where no puppy has gone before!
Cadpig: Welcome to Lucky's Rich Fantasy Life, and now back to
  reality.

Cadpig: Welcome to the sinkhole of misery.

Jasper: What do we do now, Ms. De Vil?
Cruella de Vil: We steal it.
Horace: But isn't that stealing?
Cruella de Vil: Nothing gets past you, does it?

Cruella de Vil: Did I wake you?
Roger Dearly: No, I had to get up to answer the door.

Colonel: Now, Lucky, you can not simply leap into a dangerous
  situation. You got to think, plan ahead. That's the make of a true
  hero.
Cadpig: Lucky prefers the jump out of a plane and see if gravity's on
  duty approach.

Cornelia: Where'd they learn that?
Cadpig: It just goes to show ya, an old dog can teach new chicks!

Spot: You know, I had a great song and dance number here; they cut
  it!

Cruella de Vil: You people don't have any Christmas spirit. Christmas
  is about giving, giving me more designs, more things to sell, more
  of your time!

Spot: Wait! I have to tell you two things! Number 1, Nanny left some
  extra kibble for you guys back at the shed!
Lucky, Cadpig, Rolly: What's number 2?
Spot: Look out for the sewer pipe!

Lucky: [on top of Rolly] Gotcha!
Cadpig: Lucky, next time, try clobbering the bad guy.
Lucky: Hee hee. Sorry, Rolly.

Lucky: Lieutenant! Push the cage release button!
Lt. Pug: I don't take orders from you!
Lucky: But that was part of your plan. Plan C. Remember?
Lt. Pug: Of course I remember. C for..."Cage Release".

Spot: C'mon, Pug's gonna be looking for us!
Lucky: Relax, that bonehead couldn't find his butt with both paws!
Lt. Pug: Freeze, hairballs! You traitors are all going down!
Cadpig: But...
Lt. Pug: Don't but me, Cadpig!
Cadpig: That's right, Cadpig! See what happens when you try?

Cadpig: Well, that was quite a resolution!
Lucky: Shut up, Cadpig.

Lucky: [while wearing a jet suit] Help me out of this outfit!
Cadpig: [pressing a button on his belt] Is this the zipper?
Lucky: No! That's the on switch!

Cadpig: Isn't this stealing?
Lucky: No. Stealing is when you take something from someone and never
  bring it back. This is borrowing.

Swamp Rat: Did you say L-O-B-ster? That is to say, Lobster?

Cruella de Vil: You did keep my contract to buy the farm, Roska.
Roger Dearly: Oh, no! I'm not going to sign until I have a lawyer to
  look it over, maybe two.

Rolly: If there was a real Shrewzle around, I would have smelled it.
  The Shrewzle has a very distinct odor, it's more gamey than
  squirrels and it's less musky than a raccoon, it's kind of like a
  beaver but a little less mildew.

Cruella de Vil: Don't you have any tap water?
Anita Dearly: It might be a tad rusty. Roger's been working on the
  pipes.
Cruella de Vil: Oh, well, that's just fine. I'll just think of it as
  gravy.

Cruella de Vil: This box has been opened! Are you shorting me again?
  I'll count every straw!
Man: But this is for the straws you were shorted last week.
Cruella de Vil: Oh, so it is. Well, don't let it happen again or
  it'll be the last straw!

Cruella de Vil: Our designs are on sale at the concession stand.
  Don't be afraid to make a fashion statement, people.
Boy: They're scary, like you.
Cruella de Vil: I take it back. Be afraid, be very afraid.

Mayor Ed Pig: Quiet that unruly mob, Bailiff.
Rolly: Uh, your honor, that's the jury.
Mayor Ed Pig: Well, at least they haven't formed any opinions.

Spot: This is a citizen's arrest.
Lucky: You have the right to remain guilty.
Cadpig: Anything you say will be a lie.

Lucky: [in Cruella's obscure mansion] I don't understand. It's like
  I'm in some modern-art painting. [he then goes down a twisted
  staircase] I hate modern art.

Cruella de Vil: You are such a dear to appraise my new painting. I'm
  sure it's worth a fortune, it is, after all, a portrait of me.

Lt. Pug: Are there any questions? [everyone raises their hand] Good!
  Since there are no questions...

Swamp Rat: Did you say elevator shoes?
Spot: No, that was a voice-over.

Cruella de Vil: Do you know what this means?
Horace: Balloons and ice cream and cute little happy puppies.

Roger Dearly: Is it my imagination or is that woman wearing our
  drapes?

Cruella de Vil: Jasper, Horace! You're going to the Grutely Dog Show.
Jasper: But, Horace isn't housebroken yet.
Horace: I prefer to say that I'm bladder challenged.

Jasper: I told Horace not to turn on the vacuum until we attached the
  bag.
Horace: How could I hear you with the vacuum on?
Jasper: You idiot.

Horace: We're in a real pickle, Jasper; a real pickle.
Jasper: Gotta look on the bright side, Horace, this could be our
  chance to find a job where we'll actually get paid, with money.
Horace: There's bosses who pay money? Oh, come on, how dumb do you
  think I am?

Cruella de Vil: You are fired!
Horace: Do you mean fired till tomorrow or fired till Tuesday?
Jasper: She's kind of riled up this time; we better stay fired until
  Thursday.

Cadpig: And now for the second phase of the greiving process...
  ANGER!

Cadpig: Rolly, you really must learn to control your appetite;
  appetite shouldn't control you!

Cadpig: Just think, for one brief moment, the name, Anita Dearly,
  will stand for all that is pure, and lovely, and must be dry
  cleaned.

Cadpig: Oh Rolly, gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins, and if
  you do that to me again, I'm going to violate the other six on you!

Spot: It's way past my nap time! If my mom catches me...
Cadpig: Oh, relax for once, Spot. Hang ten on the cosmic surfboard of
  freedom!
Spot: Cadpig, your metaphysical metaphors are getting weirder and
  weirder!

Lucky: You guys could help me, you know!
Cadpig: I thought this was supposed to be some Iron John macho thing.
  All you had to do was ask.

Lucky: You know, guys? If I'm chief firedog, you can come and visit
  me at the firehouse whenever you want.
Rolly: But Dad said that it's *my* destiny to be chief firedog. He
  said if I keep imagining, I can become it.
Cadpig: Well, right now, Rolly, I'm imagining you're a hopeless
  dreamer. Oh! Look! You've become one!

[repeated line]
Rolly: Oh, papa!

Rolly: Come on, help me pull this thing loose.
Spot: I thought you were too much the gourmet to chew shoes.
Rolly: I'm not gonna chew it, I'm gonna fetch it to Cruella. Maybe my
  good deed will earn me a hand up.
Cadpig: Yeah, and maybe the Tooth Fairy will fly away to Lollypop
  Land and get a cavity.

Cruella de Vil: Help me! I'm basting!

Lucky: We may have missed lunch hour, but lunch will be ours! I have
  a plan that will have us chowing down in no time! We'll be swimming
  in kibble once we...
Spot: Lucky? If I could just interject here for a second...
Lucky: Spot, don't interrupt my moment.
[continuing his speech]
Lucky: Once we... break into the chow tower!
Cadpig: [sarcastically] Great moment, Lucky.

Spot: I know what you're thinking. They look better than we do, and
  it's the chicken's fault.
Lucky: At least you've got one thing right. We're supposed to walk
  the same, sound the same and look the same. We're supposed to be
  one big dog.
Cadpig: Well, we're close. We're one big dog and a chicken.

Spot: I'm in the lead! I'm in the lead!
[falls in a puddle of mud]
Spot: I'm in the mud.

Cruella de Vil: I just love when good things happen to bad people!

Lucky: There's gotta be some way to prove she's faking.
Rolly: You sure she's still faking? I've seen healthier looking road
  kill.
Lucky: Don't let her fool you. She's a picture of health!

Lt. Pug: If you dirt weasels think that this is going to be another
  session of Sunday in the park with Grandpa, then think twice!
Cadpig: Can I think happy thoughts, Lieutenant?
Lt. Pug: Shut up, Capon!
Cadpig: It's Cadpig, Sir.
Lt. Pug: Whatever, Carpool. Now shut up and listen!

Lt. Pug: True, it's not like the good old days. Back then, you can
  drop a piano on them, or flatten them with a steamroller, or paint
  a tunnel on a wall, and they'd slam right into it. I hate cats. Of
  course, now it's a code war, so we can't get away with that any
  more.
Rolly: This guy's one doughnut short of a dozen.

Spot: Hey, did you hear something?
Rolly: Oh, that was my stomach.

Rolly: What do you know? False alarm.
Lucky: Let's look around.
[they look around for a while]
Rolly: That was fun. Anyone for gelato?
Lucky: [stops Rolly in his tracks] Something's fishy.
Rolly: You always gotta go looking for trouble, don't you? Can't you
  just accept it as a false alarm? Here. I'll prove it to you. See?
  No sheep in trouble!
Cadpig: Gosh, Rolly, I guess you were right.
[a stampede of sheep runs over them]
Cadpig: Did anyone get the license plate of those sheep?

Rolly: I can't see.
Spot: That makes you the luckiest one here.

Cadpig: Oh, that is sentimental!
Rolly: Oh, give me a break.
Lucky: Or a barf bag.
Cadpig: How could you be so insensitive? Have you never felt the
  pangs of Toujour L'amour?
Rolly: I pulled a groin once.
Lucky: I had ringworm.
Spot: Does moulting count?

Cadpig: Oh, Dumpling, beloved...
Rolly: [to Dumpling] Oh, Dumpling, you mud head!
Cadpig: Uh... er... your eyes are liquid pools, and your lips are
  cherries.
Rolly: [to Dumpling] Your eyes are lizard drool, and your lips are
  hairy!
Cadpig: No, no, you big doofus!
Rolly: [to Dumpling] No, no, you big doofus!
Spot: Oh, yeah, of course he gets *that* right.

Cadpig: The words: "Deep Emotional Scars" spring my ear.

Lucky: Man, these TV windmills are just as fake as TV heroes.

Cadpig: I could become a spokesperson for world peace... or a major
  soft drink; they pay better.

Lucky: Shouldn't stars like us have something more than second-hand
  scenery?

Bon-Bon: Mind if I make a suggestion? Shut up! And keep off the top
  bunk! It's mine.
Cadpig: Works for me. Actually, I prefer the bottom bunk.
Bon-Bon: In that case, the bottom bunk's mine.
Cadpig: Whatever tugs your leash. There's probably a better view from
  the top bunk anyway.
Bon-Bon: They're *both* mine!
Cadpig: So whatcha in for? Control issues?

Lucky: I hope we made it in time for lunch.
Cadpig: Aren't you not supposed to eat 30 minutes after you swim?
Rolly: No, it's *before* you swim. I know about these things.

Lucky: ["Thunderbolt" has just been interrupted by Cruella's
  telethon] Who turned on the Sci-Fi Channel?

Rolly: I think I'm retaining water.
Lucky: I think you're retaining doughnuts!

Lucky: [opens Cruella's suitcase] Wow! Nothing but cigarettes!
Rolly: Maybe she thinks tobacco is a food group.

Rolly: I can't wait to get my shot. Dr. Whittaker's a babe!

Cadpig: Relax. It's only a little shot.
Rolly: Yeah. There are no huge scary needles or anything. [sees a
  huge needle] Oh, boy, was I wrong.

Cadpig: Personally, I'm drawn to the symbolic journey of the roller
  coaster carrying you through life's ups and downs... till you puke.

Horace: You know? We'd be going a lot faster if we didn't have a flat
  tyre.
Jasper: Thanks for the tip, Einstein.

Rolly: [holding a bunny-shaped candy, talking with an effeminate
  voice] I am just a little bunny, and I would not hurt anyone.
[he eats the bunny and takes out another]
Rolly: I am just a little bunny and...
[he eats the bunny and takes out another]
Rolly: I... am... just...
[he eats the bunny and starts devouring the whole box]
Rolly: I need more bunnies! Give me more bunnies!
[shouts]
Rolly: Bunny!

Roger Dearly: [sees Lucky on his windshield wipers] Cool! My wipers
  look like Lucky!

Lucky: What do you want to do for fun today, Rolly?
Rolly: Well, let's see... there's breakfast, brunch, lunch, afternoon
  snack, high tea...
Lucky: There's something new.

Cadpig: Lucky, your obsession with Thunderbolt has caused you to lose
  your moral center.
Lucky: But we have to sneak in! They won't sell us tickets!
Cadpig: Shifting the blame to others. Good save!

Lucky: We've been spotted!
Cadpig: We were born that way, Luck. It's part of who we are.

Lucky: I wish I could get my mind off Thunderbolt. I can still hear
  his theme music.
Cadpig: Don't listen! That's just your subconscious tormenting you!
Rolly: It's tormenting me too... from over there!
Cadpig: What incredible kinetic power! You are throwing your
  subconscious!

Rolly: Let's face it. I'm no good at this stuff.
Cadpig: Come on, Rolly! Think positively!
Rolly: Okay, I'm positive I'm no good.

Lt. Pug: Okay, fall in! [Pug falls into a hole]
Spot: Hey, isn't that what we're supposed to do?

Lt. Pug: Duck!
Spot: Duck? What is it with you guys and poultry?

Lucky: We're safe.
Cadpig: Interesting word choice. I would have gone with "about to
  die".

Rolly: They've changed the recipe! It's the difference between Van
  Gogh and paint by numbers!

Rolly: They opened up a new Kanine Krunchies plant without me knowing
  about it?
Spot: They have to clear things up with you?

Cruella de Vil: Thank you, faceless consumer horde... I mean, people.

Spot: If only puppies everywhere knew you were the hero behind this,
  Rolly...
Rolly: Oh, tut-tut, young chicken. If I can bring a smile to their
  hearts and a belch to their lips, my work is done.

Spot: Dear Lucky, I know it must be complicated for a mere puppy to
  understand the complex in the life of an artiste, but for the first
  time in my life, I feel appreciated, I feel needed...
Cadpig: I feel nauseous!

Lucky: Red Airedale rules!
Cadpig: Yellow's my favorite.
Rolly: I like the brown one. It looks like gravy.

Lt. Pug: I'm trapped... like a... bull dog under a grocery cart!
Cadpig: Poor Pug. He's metaphorically challenged.

Horace: I think I got it now, Jasper..."Listen, this is a stick up!
  Fork over the money!"
Jasper: Too late for that, Horace. Try this..."Help! We're trapped in
  a store room!"
Horace: Help! We're stored in a trap room!
Jasper: Close.

Spot: I can still see Lucky and Rolly and good old Cadpig... it's
  almost as if I'm still alive.
Rolly: Spot, you *are* still alive.

Cadpig: And what did our horoscope predict today, Rolly? That it's a
  good day to be *rude*?

Lucky: The farm looks fantastic! Just looking at it makes me feel
  so... itchy!
Cadpig: What are you so itchy about?
Lucky: I'm itching to go to the dance with Two-Tone.
Cadpig: Someone's been bitten by the puppy love bug.
Lucky: Well, that explains why I itch... but does it explain why I
  hear music?

Cadpig: Some cook. She's ordered out for all the food.
Rolly: I hope there's leftovers!
Lucky: This is no time to think with your stomach! We've got to
  expose her as a phony.
Cadpig: Maybe we should take out her take out.
Lucky: Huh. Maybe we *should* think with Rolly's stomach.
Rolly: Oh, papa! I think I like what you're thinking!

Cydne: [after swallowing a few eggs] There goes my cholesterol.

Rolly: Get back! Get back! Get back to where you once belonged!

Lucky: Rolly, didn't you have enough to eat?
Rolly: I did. I'm having a snack now.

Cruella de Vil: How can you be the Ghost of Christmas past? You're
  just a puppy.
Cadpig: It's called "multi-tasking." I can be a cute puppy, and the
  Ghost of Christmas past, just like you can be a fashion designer,
  and pure evil.

Rolly: Don't miss lunch because of me! Save yourselves!
Cadpig: Thanks, Rolly!
Lucky: We can't just leave and let him starve!
Cadpig: We can do anything if we try.

Rolly: This is scary.
Lucky: You're right. No TV.

Cadpig: Jump aboard or eat my dust!

Duchess: That looks like fun!
Princess: Have you been drinking your own milk again?

Rolly: I dig Go-Go!
Cadpig: I love Go-Go!
Lucky: I worship Go-Go!

Roger Dearly: [throws a frisbee] Wish it was that easy to get rid of
  Cruella. Maybe if I tied a dollar around it...

Spot: [gets eaten by a shark and then spat out] Well, I don't like
  the taste of fish either!

Cadpig: I don't mean to sound judgmental, but do you have to be such
  a *colossal swine*?

[repeated line]
Rolly: Are you calling me fat?

Lt. Pug: You can take a chicken out of the hen house, but you can't
  take the smell out of a chicken! P.U.!

Spot: I think I froze my giblets!
Lucky: Hey, chill out!

Spot: Why me? I'm not ready to go to that big chicken coop in the
  sky!

Lucky: Hey, Spot, we're going to go roll in the dirt. You wanna come?
Spot: Can't. I'm sittin' on an egg. [the pups laugh] Oh, just shoot
  me now! It's Mom's orders! She says I'm spending too much time with
  you guys!
Cadpig: Why that's Dalmatian discrimination. Don't let your mother's
  intolerance crush your individuality. Fight oppression, my sister!

Lucky, Rolly: [shout] I love you, man!
Cadpig, Spot: [shout] Group hug!

Horace: I thought alien mutants from other planets were green.
Jasper: Of course, they're green. Everybody knows that.
Horace: Then how come those are blue?

Cadpig: How can you harden your heart to this majestic mollusk...
  this courtly crustacean? How can you be so selfish to a shell fish?

Cadpig: Someone will suffer for this!

Rolly: What's going to happen to Lucky?
Cadpig: He's always been lucky... let's just hope that hasn't
  changed.

Cadpig: One lump or two?
Lt. Pug: I'll give you some lumps!

Horace: If I didn't know any better, I'd say these puppies are trying
  to stop us from stealing the water.
Jasper: No, Horace, you don't know any better. In fact, you don't
  know anything.
Horace: That's a relief.

Lucky: I told you Swamp Rat would have helium.
Rolly: It's a good thing we had Dipstick to trade.
Lucky: Hmm... I wonder how much it'll cost to get him back.

Rolly: Why am I doing all the digging?
Lucky: I told you, Rolly. Ice-cream grows underground.
Rolly: Oh, yeah!

Cruella de Vil: It's true! The camera does put on pounds! Memo to
  myself: Move up liposuction appointment.

Lucky: Ten to one, it's gravel.

Spot: What are we going to do?
Cadpig: Think happy thoughts?
[Cruella appears]
Cadpig: You're not a happy thought.

Spot: How do we know it's Rolly? It could be another robot!
Rolly: Come on, guys! Let me out! I'm starving here!
Spot: All right, I'm convinced.

Rolly: Oh, no! I can't believe I actually kissed her! Now I'll have
  to get new shots! I'll never get that taste out of my mouth! The
  horror! The horror!

Lucky: What did I tell ya? Piece of c...
[a large branch falls on his head]
Lucky: ...uggghh...
Rolly: Piece of cugh? What kind of a cake is that?

[Rolly sucks up a large quantity of the kibble as well as Cadpig,
  then he spits Cadpig out]
Rolly: Yuck! What *is* this?
Cadpig: Possibly your head after I get done with it!

Spot: [wagging her tail] Hey! What's going on? I'm having some sort
  of butt-quake!

Rolly: I think I caught a bug in my teeth! Not bad, though.

Cruella de Vil: I feel so... centered. How can I ever thank you?
Gipdac: No thanks are necessary. Just remember what you have learned
  - materialism and greed have no place in the world... and it's
  really hard to get out of this position, isn't it?

Cadpig: Uh-oh, someone came between Rolly and dessert.

Cadpig: How enlightened - treating us like we're lower life forms.

Rolly: Hey, guys. What are you doing here?
Lucky: Trying to get you out of this dungeon.
Rolly: Dungeon? There's free Hoo-hahs! They don't cost nothing!
Lucky: They cost you your freedom!
Rolly: Aw, what do you mean? I like it here.
Cadpig: He doesn't realize! He's drunk with calories!

P.H. De Vil: Time to test you for side effects... and you have many
  sides to choose from.

Rolly: What's up?
Perdy: You are.

Rolly: But I don't know if I can be strong.
Lucky: You can do it, Rolly. Your friends are here to lend you
  emotional support and to truss you up like a holiday turkey.

Cruella de Vil: Not one call. Not one cent. Doesn't anyone care about
  the fashion-deprived kids?

Rolly: This is awful, she's taken our stuff, she's taken our space,
  she's taken our food.
Spot: Look on the bright side, at least we still have our
  self-respect.
Cadpig: Spot, we're living in a bookcase.

Lucky: Can't we watch something besides the gravy channel?
Rolly: It's my turn to watch what I want - "Giblets: The Movie".

Roger Dearly: Wait a minute, you were taking photos on the farm?
Cruella de Vil: Well, it's amazing what you can stumble across with a
  super telescopic antimorphic night vision lens.

Rolly: That's it, we lost Dumpling.
Lucky: No, she's gotta be somewhere. You just can't lose 300 pounds
  of rampaging bacon.

Spot: [voice-over] It was a hot day in the hen house. Crazy hot. Hot
  enough to make a criminal stick to his case.

Cornelia: My egg! My beautiful egg! Vanished!
Cadpig: Try to keep your sunnyside-up Cornelia.
[Cornelia cries harder] Bad choice of words. [back to Cornelia] But
  you really shouldn't just keep scrambling like that. [Cornelia
  cries harder] Oh, you did it again! Bad Cadpig! Bad!

[Lucky moves Dumpling out of the way of an oncoming wagon in an
  attempt to get her to save him]
Dumpling: You saved my life again!
Lucky: I should have let the wagon hit me.

[Cadpig's last lines in the whole series]
Cadpig: Well, what do you know? I was the Shaggy Green Messenger!

Lucky: Are you just going to keep giving us stuff to do until we give
  up?
Cadpig: What Lucky means is, he believes you have a subconscious fear
  of losing.
Rolly: In other words, he's calling you a yellow-bellied,
  lily-livered chicken!
Spot: Not that that's a bad thing...

Cadpig: Whistling is a way of audibly extending your inner joy to
  those around you.
Mayor Ed Pig: I'm the mayor, and I have passed a law stating that no
  whistling is allowed on this here farm!
Cadpig: Thank you for sharing, your lardship.

Spot: I'm hot.
Rolly: I'm hungry.
Cadpig: Let's all think ice cream.
[a fast moving tub of ice cream runs by picking them up]
Cadpig: Everybody stop thinking!

Cadpig: Why can't you run for mayor? You're charismatic, you talk a
  lot, you're bossy, you're always telling people what to do...
Lucky: Okay, okay, I get your point!
Cadpig: I can even be your personal image consultant. I love
  manipulating the truth.
Rolly: And I can be your advisor.
Spot: And I can manage your campaign. I have a neck for seeing
  trouble coming.

Cadpig: It's because the planets' current alignment favors dogs.
  We're in a Pluto phase.

Spot: [after getting run over by a bunch of puppies] Look at all the
  pretty spots.

Rolly: Next year, I wanna be the ballot box!

Princess: When Nanny milked me this morning, her hands nearly froze
  my udders off!
Duchess: When are we getting those heated milking gloves you promised
  us?
Lucky: Vice-Vice-Vice Mayor Spot is hard at work on that.
Spot: Yeah, and we got a finance committee extrapolating a
  freezability report on...
Lucky: [dissolve to the pups in a new place] What did you say?
Spot: I was hoping you knew.

Cadpig: Technically speaking, Mooch is really the one with egg on his
  face.

Lucky: Cadpig, would you stop whistling before I declare it illegal
  again?

Spot: Ed Pig's just called a meeting to discuss all the promises you
  made.
Lucky: Well, tell them it's illegal to talk about my promises.
Spot: That doesn't seem fair.
Lucky: Who are you to say what's fair, Spot? I'm the mayor.
Cadpig: Somebody needs a little attitude adjustment.
Rolly: Yeah, Lucky! Pretty soon, you're going to be eating all our
  ice cream!
Spot: And making us watch whatever shows you want!
Lucky: Then I could if I wanted to. I can do anything I want.
Rolly: Huh! Then you're gonna have to find yourself another vice
  mayor!
Cadpig: ...and vice-vice mayor!
Spot: ...and vice-vice-vice mayor too!
Lucky: Guess I should just pass a law saying that I'm no better than
  Ed Pig.

Rolly: It sure was nice of Mayor Pig to give us this ice cream.
Spot: Guess he's not such a bad guy after all.
Cadpig: There's a warm heart between all those pork rinds.
Lucky: After that promise mess, I'm just happy to be done with my
  political career.
Rolly: Glad to hear it, Lucky.
Lucky: Everybody knows the real power is in big corporations.
[Rolly, Cadpig and Spot throw ice cream chunks at Lucky]
Lucky: [laughs] Just kidding.

Anita Dearly: Roger, what's taking you so long?
Roger Dearly: Uh, I was making sure the oven is locked and the doors
  are off... uh, I mean...
Anita Dearly: Honey, why are you carrying my sewing machine?
Roger Dearly: Oops.

Lucky: Boy, you'd think she'd at least show her good side on TV.
Rolly: You think Cruella has one?
Cadpig: Everybody has a good side, Rolly. Hers just isn't visible to
  the naked eye.

Lucky: Let's see. "Reheat", "Defrost", "Popcorn"... Ah, here it is.
  "Declone."

Roger Dearly: Is the bathtub running?
Anita Dearly: If it is, you'd better go out and catch it.

Cadpig: I feel so... abandoned! [sobbing]
Spot: What's the matter? You've been away from your parents lots of
  times.
Cadpig: Well, I always left them. They never left me. I feel anxious,
  and hostile, and my tail is all poofy, and my nose is... runny!
  [she blows her nose on Spot's arm]
Spot: Thank you for sharing.

Cadpig: Fascinating. This website posts hundreds of pet psychological
  problems. I'm sure I can find my symptoms listed.
Spot: Oh, yeah. Fascinating. Who knew there'd be so many goldfish
  with fin envy?
Rolly: Or lovebirds in need of marriage counseling?
Lucky: Or that we've spent our one weekend without parental
  supervision watching Cadpig's nasal drip?

Cadpig: I need to be petted! [screams] And I need it now!
Lucky: [points at Rolly] He'll do it.
Rolly: [points at Spot] She'll do it.
Spot: Mother.

Lucky: We're exhausted.
Rolly: How long do we have to keep this up?
Spot: I have a feeling we're going to be doing this forever!
Cadpig: What are you guys complaining about? I'm the one who needs
  attention!

Two-Tone: [to Mooch] I just came by here to say to you that I have
  nothing to say to you. If I had anything to say to you, I'd say it
  to Lucky... my date tonight at the dance!

Roger Dearly: Uh... I think the pups want to stop.
Cruella de Vil: At a dog food factory? Over my dead body.
[the pups flatten her]
Roger Dearly: Close enough.

Lucky: Come on, Rolly! We gotta hightail it to the museum! We don't
  want to miss the Fire Hydrants of the World exhibit!
Rolly: Just send me a postcard, Lucky. I'm getting a cramp here.
Cadpig: I'm getting a cramp too! A big giant smile cramp!

Cadpig: [shouts] Bring back that purse, you big jerk! Ooh, I gotta
  work on my underlying hostility.

Lucky: Somebody's gotta take a bite out of crime.
Cadpig: Yeah, right.

Cadpig: What a dramatic day it has been.
Rolly: Yeah, I think I pulled my groin.

Cadpig: [to a couple of cows] Hello, my name is Cadpig, and you two
  are... [puts a nametag on each of them saying, "cow"] cows.
  Nametags will help us all bond in a friendly, yet functional
  fashion.

Cruella de Vil: Tell me, are there still 101, or did I happen to take
  out a couple of the mutts when I drove in?

Lucky: Isn't it fun spending the night? Just like old times.
Rolly: I don't remember freezing my butt off, Lucky!
Lucky: Back at the barn, you were hot!
Rolly: Well, now I'm cold.
Cadpig: I'm hungry. Both physically and spiritually. I still miss my
  friends.

[the pups are at the bottom of a fireplace looking up the chimney]
Rolly: You sure this will work, Lucky?
Lucky: Trust me.
[the puppies stack up. Lucky loosens some soot causing Rolly to
  sneeze, which causes the trio to fall]
Lucky: This feels very familiar.

Cruella de Vil: I picked the wrong week to quit smoking.

Anita Dearly: Nanny, make some food for the puppies; they're probably
  hungry.
Lucky: Who cares about the food? I'm just glad we're home.
Rolly: *I* care about the food!

Cruella de Vil: Who's idea was it to put a bird bath in the middle of
  your driveway?
Anita Dearly: Cruella, we don't have a bird bath in our driveway.
Cruella de Vil: Well, you do now.

Cadpig: I love bird baths! I love birds. They make me happy.
[Lucky screeches in, head-butting Cadpig off screen]
Cadpig: [shouts] Watch it, Bird Brain!

Cadpig: Oh, goody! We get to ferret out the ferret!

Rolly: What took you guys so long?
Cadpig: [trying to get Rolly unstuck from the fence] We were too busy
  not getting stuck!
[Rolly gets pulled free and crushes Cadpig]
Cadpig: [very weakly] Ouch.

Cadpig: That's where we come in, Rolly. We've got to counter all our
  counterproductive gut-stripping fears, and do what any best friend
  would do - go in there, and face Cruella with him!
Rolly: ...or, we could just leave.
Cadpig: Sure. We can do that.

Lt. Pug: Now for your reward... [shouts] Hit the deck and give me 20!

Lt. Pug: What's your name, soldier?
Cadpig: Cadpig, sir.
Lt. Pug: Hit the deck, Pig Dog, and give me 37!
Cadpig: You know, sir, the use of pejorative labels only gives you
  the illusion of power.
Lt. Pug: Make that 38!

Lucky: [to the TV] Are you all right? You had me so worried!

Cadpig: How long do you suppose Captain Flea Dip will be conquering
  space today?
Spot: Probably just his usual romp to the Omega Quadron and back.

Cadpig: Exercise equipment? Why would anyone put that on a spaceship?
Spot: Why would anyone eat processed cheese?

VLAD: VLAD had to fool his furry and feather friends.
Lucky: Why? Why did VLAD have to?
VLAD: Skinny evil woman wanted to change VLAD. Went to turn VLAD into
  flight fat farm. VLAD's mission to violate countries, not melt off
  pounds fast.
Rolly: But why dognap us?
VLAD: VLAD wanted little comrades to help fulfill VLAD's destiny: to
  seek and destroy all orbiting traffic and become star of outer
  space!
Cadpig: Of course.
Spot: Should have guessed.
Rolly: What else?

Cadpig: We all need to express our dark side, but give it a rest.

Cadpig: It was just nice to have everyone look up to me for a while.
  Take my advice. Give me a feeling of importance.
Lucky: Well, it gave *me* chills and a fever *and* frostbite on my
  tail.

Anita Dearly: Having you join us, Cruella, was such an unexpected
  surprise.
Cruella de Vil: Well, I knew that hang up on my voice mail must have
  been you calling to invite me.

Lucky: You're toast, Turkey Lips!
Mooch: You're mouse meat, Midget Mutt!

Lucky: Gum?
Rolly: Check.
Lucky: String?
Cadpig: Check.
Lucky: Chicken?
Spot: I hate my life.

Spot: Don't you want to learn?
Lucky: Spot, don't you get it? Only geeks learn barking code, and
  only losers teach it.

Lt. Pug: *I* took command! *I* faced the enemy! Granted, it was a
  fictional enemy, but those are the worst kind!

Roger Dearly: How do I know you're not making the same old empty
  promises?
Cruella de Vil: Oh, don't be ridiculous. These are brand new empty
  promises.

Cruella de Vil: I'll have my people call your people... oh, that's
  right. You don't have people.

Jasper: It's time for Phase 2.
Horace: Is Phase 2 the second thing?
Jasper: This is hard for you, isn't it?
Horace: A little.

Jasper: Phase 3.
Horace: Now, is Phase 3 the first thing?
Jasper: Now, how can it be the first thing?
Horace: That's a toughie.

Cadpig: You know, Lieutenant, instead of taking us on your usual
  machismo tour, why don't we cadets do something more enlightening
  like explore our feminine side?
Lt. Pug: Feminine side my grandma! I don't have a feminine side!
Cadpig: Sure you do. It's in there somewhere. The sensitive,
  nurturing, patient part in all of us. [a truck runs by covering
  Cadpig in mud] Hold that thought. [chases after the truck] You
  mud-slinging bag of slime!
Lt. Pug: Whoa. She's good. Maybe we should get in touch with our
  feminine sides.

Lt. Pug: Are you two done with that helium?
Lucky, Rolly: [high-pitched voices] All finished, Sir.

Lucky: We're not lifting off.
Lt. Pug: We've got too much weight.
Rolly: Oh, so now I *add* fat.

Rolly: [has a fish biting his tail] Ooh! A crab! A crab!

Spot: [has a treasure map on her face] Why do they always mark the
  "spot" with an X?

Cadpig: My, just look at that. To those few of us versed in the
  ancient art of alligator-tongue reading, your future is an open
  book. I can see a career in the luggage business, I see someone
  gorgeous in your future... Ooh, and you have a very long life line.
  See?

Lucky: Now, if I can just find that X...
Cadpig: What did I tell you earlier, Luckless? That's only on TV.
Rolly: Well, I didn't come all this way for nothing. I'll find that
  treasure.
Spot: Guess again! You'll never find it without me! [they all see a
  big "X"]
Rolly: Whoa! The treasure!
Lucky: X marks the spot!
Cadpig: [to the camera] Well, what did you expect?

Cruella de Vil: I'd get rid of you mutts right now, but there's
  probably a tax on revenge.

Roger Dearly: Anita, is someone here?
Anita Dearly: It's Cruella, dear.
Roger Dearly: Bring her in here. Maybe she can scare the termites to
  death.

Lucky: How weird.
Rolly: Where'd they all go? Who's gonna feed us?
Cadpig: Abducted! All of them!
Spot: Now let's try to think about this logically... [yells] We're
  all gonna die!

Cadpig: Can't a dog have a little sensory deprivation in peace?

Cadpig: You're making popcorn now?
Rolly: Can I have some?

Lucky: You guys okay?
Cadpig: Yeah.
Rolly: Uh-huh.
Spot: Sure. I always make that sound when I'm drowning.

Rolly: What good is being a nice guy when people think you're a
  bonehead? Or a sucker? Or a...
Cadpig: Chump? Sap? Stooge? Patsy?
[the others glare at her]
Cadpig: I got a thesaurus for Christmas.

Cadpig: See, Bon-Bon? I knew you had a soft gooey center. It's a
  little gooier than I expected, but go ahead and let it all ooze
  out.

Rolly: Those people are blocking my view. Give them a hand, will ya?
Spot: But sir, I'm a chicken, not a duck.
Rolly: A bird's a bird. Hit the water.

Cadpig: Other than winning the limbo contest, what exactly did you
  get out of this, Rolly?
Rolly: Well, there was that buffet.

Gipdac: You two have been brought here to learn a system of inner
  values - peace, interplanetary harmony, and stellar convergence.
Cruella de Vil: Oh, very '60s. Memo to myself: Bring back Go-Go
  Boots.

Lucky: Where's your pioneer spirit? Where's your sense of adventure?
  Where's... Where's the scarf?

Lucky: I said a scarf, not a muffler!

Lucky: Hi, I'm Lucky.
Swamp Rat: Well, you most certainly are... lucky you met me, and I am
  lucky I met you.

Cadpig: That's a Steven?

Rolly: My dogs are killing me.
Spot: Dogs? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Rolly: "Rolly, you eat too much!" "Rolly, you sleep too much!"
  "Rolly, your butt is blocking the sun!" Why don't they come out and
  say it? "Rolly, we think you're a pig!"

Cadpig: Today is the honeymoon phase. Tomorrow, divorce pork.

Cadpig: You know, I think we've entered the third phase of grief -
  blame, and I blame *both of you*!

Roger Dearly: This is a smoke-free house. Not one cigarette touches
  your lips! You'll have to quit like I did: cold turkey!

Cruella de Vil: [finds herself chewing on someone's socks] Lovely
  stockings. Argyle?

Cruella de Vil: That does it, Anita. I'll never smoke again. I've hit
  bottom. Once you've chewed on a man's socks, the world is a whole
  different flavor.

Cadpig: Saving a bottom feeder should at least give me a humanitarian
  award.

Spot: What do you mean you liberated a lobster?
Cadpig: I had no choice. He was heading for that big butter bath in
  the sky!
Spot: But it's stealing! The lobster police will get us for sure.
Rolly: Spot's right. We gotta eat the evidence. Anybody got a squeeze
  of lemon?
Cadpig: Rolly, how could you?
Rolly: Nothing personal. It's a food chain thing.

Spot: Are you sure this is a good lobster neighborhood? I mean, what
  are the schools like?

Cadpig: You said you were going to make him a contributing member of
  society!
Swamp Rat: He's contributing to my gumbo recipe. Close enough.
[the match Swamp Rat is holding catches his fingers on fire]
Swamp Rat: Yeow! I hope a little kid never holds a lit match like
  that! That could hurt!
Rolly: You'll never get away with this, Swamp Rat! A decent gumbo
  needs cayenne pepper!
Swamp Rat: There's plenty of cayenne in it, chubby boy! The secret is
  to start with a wallop of kosher salt.
Rolly: Salt? No, no, no. First, the cayenne pepper, then the...
Lucky, Cadpig, Spot: [shouts] Rolly!

Cruella de Vil: On my ship, we serve only the freshest sea food. It's
  so fresh, it fights back. Don't you just love an entree with spunk?

Cadpig: Is it possible that I was an unclear communicator?
  Demonstrated poor listening skills? Was too caught up in my mission
  to assess Lance's needs?
Lucky, Spot, Rolly: Uh-huh!
Rolly: And don't forget to add a count of Grand Theft Lobster!
Spot: Hey, you were just trying to help a fellow creature. We know
  your heart was in the right place.

Spot: You know what happens to bullies?
Mooch: Yeah. They get all the good stuff.

Lucky: We're gonna have a wonderful time. No pets, no parents. It'll
  be our vacation too.
Rolly: Yeah, Nanny will just keep busy watching over us, and we'll
  just kick back and eat and eat. And then, we'll eat. And then,
  after that... we'll eat.
Cadpig: I sense a theme.

Cruella de Vil: Bacon? What animal lays that?

Lucky: Go for it, Rolly!
Cadpig: Eat like the wind!
Rolly: I really love you guys!
Spot: Stand back! You might get sucked into the vortex!

Steven the Aligator: I promise I won't eat you.
Lucky: Sadly, that's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me
  today.

Lucky: Give me a sentence in 25 words or less.
Cadpig: Okay, I'll give you 8 words: I think my educated brother is a
  big jerk!
Lucky: That was 9 words.

Jasper: [singing] We've got a singing telegram for Nanny... Nanny...
  From her sister in a jam in a great big way.
Horace: [singing] Add a broken "B". I picked a fight, you see. I won
  the fight, but I broke my knee. Need your help. Love, Franny.
Nanny: Oh, awful! Just awful!
Jasper: Could've been worse. We also do strip-o-grams.
Nanny: I was talking about my sister!

Cadpig: We'll wring every last drop of guilt our of you. But hey,
  what are friends for?

Man: What types of jobs have you two had in the past?
Horace: Mostly unpaid.
Man: Unpaid?
Jasper: Uh... unafraid.

Cadpig: You know, you really should exercise your minds as well as
  your bodies.

Cadpig: You okay, Rolly?
Rolly: Why, yes, Cadpig. I've always dreamed of being a throw rug.

Cadpig: Lucky? Pug? I think we should define the problem, propose
  solutions, then choose an act. That will lead to a resolution.
Lucky: The problem is I seem to have a Pug on my collar.

[Spot has just woken Cadpig up]
Cadpig: Spot, I just reached my R.E.M. state.

Spot: Have you ever seen Lock Jaw?
Lt. Pug: Nobody's ever seen him... but I've heard him stomping
  through the night looking for his favorite dish: Chicken Veronica
  with a bed of marinated puppies.
Rolly: Is that served with a white sauce?
Lucky: Rolly!

Lt. Pug: Whatever you do, don't sneeze. Someone always sneezes in
  these situations.

Cadpig: Now, Lieutenant Pug, Mr. Jaw wants to know why you've been
  spreading vicious rumors about him behind his back. He finds it...
  dehumanizing.

Horace, Jasper: [singing] I've been working on the railroad / All the
  live-long day...
Jasper: [singing] I've been working on the railroad / Just to pass
  the time a... Hey!

Lucky: They're giving us away.
Cadpig: Throwing us out like day-old pizza!
Rolly: Nobody would do that, would they? Do a pizza on me?
Spot: They're tossing us out on our furry little butts! Wait a
  minute... I'm a *feather* butt. Maybe this doesn't include me.

Cadpig: I don't handle rejection well! Although, I have revenge down
  pat.

Cadpig: Maybe we should look at the bright side: We're beginning down
  the road less traveled. The start of a brand new life. [Lucky and
  Rolly glare at her] Sorry. I was just trying to put a positive spin
  on doom.

Lucky: Well, Cadpig, it's the start of a whole new life.
Cadpig: Lucky, I'm conflicted. I can't tell if I'm suffering from
  abandonment issues or separation anxiety. [her stomach makes weird
  noises]... or gas.

Rolly: What things could a chicken possibly want?
Lucky: Don't ask.

Spot: [wearing a vest] Cock-a-doodle-doo! Look at me! I'm a Dalmatian
  too!

Lucky: Our Rolando is a little too rotundo.

[Rolly races past Lucky and Cadpig at warp speed]
Cadpig: He must have spotted a cupcake!

Cruella de Vil: Welcome Baron Effem Von Schnickledoodle! [a very old
  man enters]
Cruella de Vil: Can I get you anything? A drink? Hors d'oeuvres?
  Oxygen? Memo to myself: Make this a short engagement.

Lucky: Fly, Spot! Fly!

Lucky: Man, that's got "thrill ride" written all over it! You guys
  should check this out!

Racoon: You guys all right with this?
Rolly: I am, but Swifty here seems a little nervous.
Swifty: [hyperactively] What do you *mean*? I've never been so
  relaxed in all my life!

Rolly: I'm famished, and you bring me stinky footwear? Please!
Cadpig: It's the perfect snack! Did you want some dipping sauce?
Rolly: I'd never chew shoes! I'm a gourmet. A kibble connoisseur,
  don't you know. My taste buds are oh so defined.

Rolly: Come on, Spot. Live it up! You're eating like a bird!
Spot: Rolly, I am a bird! A bird with serious digestive problems!

Cornelia: And just what have you been up to?
Spot: Uh... howling at the moon?
Cornelia: Again with the dog act? What next? Walking? A leash? Fire
  hydrant?
Spot: That was one time. And it was an accident.
Cornelia: Well, it's not going to happen again!

Lucky: It's all chicken scratch to me. What's it say?
Cornelia: "Not a chicken. Not a dog. Have left to interface with my
  growth potentialities. Farewell." Only one beast on this farm talks
  like that!
Cadpig: What can I say? It's a precious gift.

Roger Dearly: Well, I wouldn't waste my breath wishing Cruella a
  Merry Christmas. She'd charge us for the air we breath if she could
  get away with it.

Cadpig: Rolly, you really shouldn't be guessing people's gifts, it'll
  ruin the surprise. What I get?
Rolly: Same as last year - chew toy.
Cadpig: Oh, well, it's the thought that counts. Besides, I can always
  return it.

Lucky: Don't worry. This is totally safe. Safe as safety-scissors
  safe.
Spot: Lucky, I think I really must tell you that...
Lucky: Spot, you're going to have to stay back! This is totally
  dangerous! Very, very dangerous!

Roger Dearly: Hey, look, Lucky wants to go. Take him instead of me,
  Cruella will never know the difference.

Ivy: I bet you puppies would like a nice little treat.
Rolly: She's won my trust.

Spot: Hey, are you guys missing anything?
Mooch: Well, Dipstick is missing his marbles. Whizzer lost his
  bladder control this morning, but otherwise, nope.

Lucky: But this is unfair! Whatever happened to justice, whatever
  happened to honor?
Rolly: Whatever happened to that little piece of fat you got inside
  of pork and beans?

Roger Dearly: No, Lucky. This isn't a game for pets.
Cruella de Vil: Here! Let me have a go at this!
Roger Dearly: No, Cruella. This isn't a game for pests... uh, I mean,
  uh... fashion designers.

Cadpig: Roger, calling this computer sorta buggy is like saying
  Cruella is kinda selfish.

Spot: According to my calculations, in order to get into the chow
  tower, you need 108 more pounds!
Cadpig: Rolly and I add another eight pounds. We need a hundred more.
Lucky: How 'bout Cruella? I bet she weighs a hundred pounds.
Rolly: Yeah, so do a bunch of rocks.
Cadpig: We vote for the rocks.

Cadpig: Ah, spring, a season of renewal. The flowers are blooming,
  the birds are chirping, Nanny is ridding the house of Cruella's
  electronic surveillance devices.

Cadpig: Sweet Goddess of Love. That is the biggest egg I have ever
  seen.
Spot: That's nothing compared to Mom! You should see what she hacks
  up at Easter!

Lt. Pug: Well, that does it. The cookie has sung. The fat lady has
  crumbled. The Bark Brigade is yours.

Cruella de Vil: Welcome wagon! A special cake for my new neighbors.
Roger Dearly: "Happy Bar-Mitzvah, Howard?"
Cruella de Vil: Well, it's the only thing they had up at that old
  donut shack in Grutely. Memo to myself: Buy that donut shack in
  Grutely and fire everybody.

Two-Tone: Yard sales? I love yard sales! Actually, I hate yard sales.
  The pros of a yard sale are the bargains, but the cons of a yard
  sale are that the items are used! Ugh!
Cadpig: Two-Tone? Focus!

Lucky: Where did you learn about this?
Spot: I'm Professor Egghead Science Over-Easy!

Two-Tone: Hi, Mooch. Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Mooch: It was! I can't see it anymore!

Lucky: I look like a big wad of bubble gum.
Rolly: Then why'd you dye yourself pink? You shoulda picked another
  color!

Spot: How do you hide an elephant?
Rolly: Maybe we can put him on wheels and disguise him as a vacuum
  cleaner.
Spot: Or stick little magnets on him and pretend he's a refrigerator.
Cadpig: Or put a saddle on his back and pretend he's a horse with a
  glandular problem.

Rolly: Anybody want some peanuts? [the other pups give strange looks]
  What? It's not like I've never offered you any of my food before.
  Okay, so it's been a while.

Cadpig: Uh-oh! I'm having and out-of-bubble experience!

Cadpig: Look on the bright side, Rolly. If this takes much longer,
  it'll be dinner time.
Rolly: But I need food now!
Spot: Relax, you guys. Just look back...
Lucky: Only quitters look back! We've gotta look forward! Am I right?
Cadpig, Rolly: Yeah!

Lucky: Why are we baking her a cake now? She hasn't won the Designer
  of the Year award yet. She's only been nominated.
Cadpig: It is an honor just to be nominated. Of course, winning adds
  in the joy of rubbing everybody's nose in it.

Waiter: Something wrong?
Roger Dearly: I thought the husband of the winner would rate a better
  table.
Waiter: The husband of the winner usually doesn't bring pets wearing
  his suspenders.

Cruella de Vil: My pool is ruined! And whoever heard of Cruella De
  Vil with blue and white hair? There ought to be a law against
  dumping gunk like this!
Jasper: There is.
Horace: But you told us to ignore it.

Lucky: We gotta think of a way to stop them.
Rolly: We can flatten the tyres.
Lucky: Hmm... I know! We'll flatten the tyres!
Rolly: Hey!

Spot: Duck!
Lucky: What? Low bridge?
Spot: No, I mean, *duck*!

Anita Dearly: Cruella, what's wrong?
Cruella de Vil: My bedroom! That's what's wrong! Burned to a crisp!
Roger Dearly: So, now it matches the kitchen, den and garage?
Cruella de Vil: Very ammusing, Randy, but that's the least of my
  problems.

Cruella de Vil: My cook quit again this morning, I'd like to borrow
  Ninny to prepare brunch.
Nanny: It's Nanny!
Cruella de Vil: No one cares, dear.

Anita Dearly: Cruella, you're getting married! Who's the lucky...
Roger Dearly: Victim?

Lucky: You wanna watch TV?
Cadpig: Nah, it's not the same without Rolly drooling at the food
  commercials.

Spot: [as a dalmatian] Guys, it's me! Spot!
Lucky: Yeah, and I'm Thunderbolt!
Spot: But it really is me!
Lucky: Okay, tell us something that only Spot would know.
Spot: All right... like... where Rolly keeps his fritters.
Lucky: Oh, come on! Everybody knows that!
Rolly: [surprised] Everyone knows where my fritters are?

Nanny: What just happened here?
Anita Dearly: Well, as near as I can tell, Cruella just wanted to
  meet our cows.
Roger Dearly: I will never figure that woman out.

Cadpig: Does anyone else feel tension here?

Cadpig: Since when do motorcycle gangs value fighting fair?
Rolly: Remember, Roger wrote this game.
Cadpig: Oh yeah. Question answered.

Rolly: I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm ready to
  apologize.
Lucky: But what about our principles?
Cadpig: I don't recall us having principles where it's All right to
  call people names. Interesting concept, though.

Lucky: Hiccup Hole isn't just a pond. It's a symbol... of freedom...
  and justice... and home, and country, and, and, and... apple pie!
Rolly: Would that apple pie be a la mode?

Spot: The swamp? This is your better idea? May I remind you of a few
  of the dangers like snakes and alligators and molaria and quicksand
  and deadly swamp gas?
Cadpig: You're one of those glass is half-empty people, aren't you?

Cadpig: Don't toy with my emotions. I'm fragile... and so are you!

Cadpig: I'm throwing my support firmly behind my bull-headed brother!

Cruella de Vil: [she is handing out office supplies] Merry Christmas
  Anita
Anita Dearly: [Is handed Susan's nametag] Susan?
Cruella de Vil: Oops, I must've grabbed the wrong one, I meant to
  give you yours, because, well, I'm giving you your job back, you
  can have Susan's desk too, I'm firing her tomorrow.

Rolly: [as they are chasing Mooch] Release the hounds!
Cadpig: We are the hounds!

Rolly: When will people learn...
Cadpig: that couping out dogs is inhumane...
Lucky: and not to mention illegal?

Cadpig: Remember, style is 99% attitude and 1% revolving credit. So
  let's see you sell it, buddy!

Lucky: Okay, here's the deal: a double jump. Whoever makes the bigger
  splash wins.
Mooch: What about your stitches, Luckless?
Lucky: You just let me worry about that.
Cadpig: Pardon me, but is there any chance that I can make a tiny
  plea for sanity? [Lucky and Mooch ignore Cadpig and jump off the
  tree branch] I didn't think so.

Lucky: Now's our chance to expose her.
Cadpig: Normally, I'm against unprovoked violence, but in this
  case... TRASH HER!

Spot: I think we're lost!
Lucky: We're not lost.
Cadpig: I prefer the term, locationally challenged.

Cadpig: What is he so testy about? It's not like it was grand theft
  auto.
Spot: That's exactly what it was, Cadpig!
Cadpig: Picky, picky.

Cadpig: I admire your proactive spirit, Lucky, but if this goes
  wrong, you're taking the fall.

Rolly: What survival skill should we try first?
Lucky: We can survive later. Right now, let's have some fun.

Rolly: Do you think she's alright?
Cadpig: If anyone can scare off the angel of death, it's Cruella.

Lucky: We've got to work together to get through this.
Cadpig: He's right. We've got to prioritize. Survive now... bury him
  in blame later!

Pongo: Lucky, what are you doing here?
Lucky: Surviving. We worked together to survive the blizzard. I told
  you we could do it!
Pongo: You also disobeyed me! You're all grounded for a week!
Cadpig: That's cruel and unusual!
Pongo: Oh, you'll survive it if you work together.

Spot: [shouts] Waterfall!
Lucky: Who put a waterfall there?

Spot: I've gotta work on my will power.

Cadpig: I always said Rolly would make a great teacher. I just never
  believed it.

Cadpig: What is a dog? What is a chicken? Does anyone ever really
  know?

Cadpig: I'm having trouble getting centered! It's all this
  unfamiliarity! I need a sense of place!

Lt. Pug: Do you know the secret password?
Spot: No, can't say I do.
Lucky: Uh, nope.
Cadpig: I do!
Lt. Pug: Rats. Didn't think anyone knew. Okay, you can come in, the
  rest of you stay outside!
Cadpig: Simple minds, simple answers.

Cadpig: Aw, did the boogeyman creep into your subconscious and go
  boo?

Lucky: Rolly, are you alright?
Cadpig: Looks okay, except he's about to plummet to his doom.

Lt. Pug: Come on, come on, cadet! Move your spotty chicken behind and
  cross that road!
Spot: Why?
Lt. Pug: If I wore boots, I'd have four good reasons why!
Spot: Sorry, sir, but I can't cross the road without a reason why.
  It's a chicken thing.

Lucky: I know you're smart, Spot, but how do you handle pressure?
  Solve this simple word problem in say, thirty seconds.
Spot: Ah-ha, no problem! Two trains are heading toward each other,
  one at twenty-five miles an hour and the other at forty. They're
  fifty miles apart and getting closer on the same track, but with no
  time to throw the switch, they collide, head on. All aboard perish
  and it's all my fault!
Lucky: Next.

Cadpig: I always say, if you can't conquer life's obstacles, think of
  an alternative.

Lucky: Oh, I don't feel so hot; I think I'm getting seasick.
Cadpig: My center is definitely moving.

Rolly: Does this mean there's no picnic?
Lucky: No picnic? She's taking her clothes! We might not have a
  family anymore!
Cadpig: I see a lot of therapy in our future. [instantly perks up]
  Won't it be great?

Lucky: Hey, guys, don't panic! Lighten up!
Cadpig: Lighten up? We're already weightless!

Rolly: Lucky? Scorch? Overboard? As in not on board anymore?
Cadpig: We've got to go in and save them!
Rolly: Maybe we should tell our pets instead.
Cadpig: Rolly, sometimes being a coward is the right choice.
Rolly: Thanks.

Roger Dearly: Oh no! It's Cruella! She's here! I'm seeing spots
  before my eyes!
Anita Dearly: Roger, don't quit your day job.

Spot: The Silver Egg Social? But that's for chickens!
Cornelia: Exactly! And it's time you started acting like a chicken
  instead of some bone-digging, kibble-eating, tree-sniffing dog!
Spot: But I am a dog! I'm a dog trapped in a chicken's body!
Cornelia: I don't care if you're an aardvark trapped in a baboon's
  pinky!

Lt. Pug: Today's survival mission is one that you'll remember for the
  rest of your dog days! [He gets hit by a falling newspaper]
Cadpig: Karma! Gotta love it!

Cadpig: Someone took my daily affirmation calender! What will I do?
  How will I center? How will I... focus my rage so I can rip the
  lips off the thieving jerk?

Cadpig: Nice guy; must be on a lunch break from the inquisition.

Spot: Hey! This sock smells like feet! My heat's filled with toe
  germs! I could get sick! What is I get athlete's nose! That could
  lead to nasal rot!
Cadpig: She looks like a pup, but she's still her old, neurotic self.

Cadpig: Rolly, feelings are like a table of pies. If you eat every
  single one, eventually, you're gonna puke. I'm asking you to share
  your pies before you toss your cookies.


# "101 Dalmatians: The Series" (1997) {Citizen Canine (#2.14)}
Lucky: Are you just going to keep giving us stuff to do until we give
  up?
Cadpig: What Lucky means is, he believes you have a subconscious fear
  of losing.
Rolly: In other words, he's calling you a yellow-bellied,
  lily-livered chicken!
Spot: Not that that's a bad thing...

Cadpig: Whistling is a way of audibly extending your inner joy to
  those around you.
Mayor Ed Pig: I'm the mayor, and I have passed a law stating that no
  whistling is allowed on this here farm!
Cadpig: Thank you for sharing, your lardship.

Spot: I'm hot.
Rolly: I'm hungry.
Cadpig: Let's all think ice cream.
[a fast moving tub of ice cream runs by picking them up]
Cadpig: Everybody stop thinking!

Cadpig: Why can't you run for mayor? You're charismatic, you talk a
  lot, you're bossy, you're always telling people what to do...
Lucky: Okay, okay, I get your point!
Cadpig: I can even be your personal image consultant. I love
  manipulating the truth.
Rolly: And I can be your advisor.
Spot: And I can manage your campaign. I have a neck for seeing
  trouble coming.

Cadpig: It's because the planets' current alignment favors dogs.
  We're in a Pluto phase.

Spot: [after getting run over by a bunch of puppies] Look at all the
  pretty spots.

Rolly: Next year, I wanna be the ballot box!

Princess: When Nanny milked me this morning, her hands nearly froze
  my udders off!
Duchess: When are we getting those heated milking gloves you promised
  us?
Lucky: Vice-Vice-Vice Mayor Spot is hard at work on that.
Spot: Yeah, and we got a finance committee extrapolating a
  freezability report on... [dissolve to the pups in a new place]
Lucky: What did you say?
Spot: I was hoping you knew.

Cadpig: Technically speaking, Mooch is really the one with egg on his
  face.

Lucky: Cadpig, would you stop whistling before I declare it illegal
  again?

Spot: Ed Pig's just called a meeting to discuss all the promises you
  made.
Lucky: Well, tell them it's illegal to talk about my promises.
Spot: That doesn't seem fair.
Lucky: Who are you to say what's fair, Spot? I'm the mayor.
Cadpig: Somebody needs a little attitude adjustment.
Rolly: Yeah, Lucky! Pretty soon, you're going to be eating all our
  ice cream!
Spot: And making us watch whatever shows you want!
Lucky: Then I could if I wanted to. I can do anything I want.
Rolly: Huh! Then you're gonna have to find yourself another vice
  mayor!
Cadpig: ...and vice-vice mayor!
Spot: ...and vice-vice-vice mayor too!
Lucky: Guess I should just pass a law saying that I'm no better than
  Ed Pig.

Rolly: It sure was nice of Mayor Pig to give us this ice cream.
Spot: Guess he's not such a bad guy after all.
Cadpig: There's a warm heart between all those pork rinds.
Lucky: After that promise mess, I'm just happy to be done with my
  political career.
Rolly: Glad to hear it, Lucky.
Lucky: Everybody knows the real power is in big corporations.
[Rolly, Cadpig and Spot throw ice cream chunks at Lucky]
Lucky: [laughs] Just kidding.


# "101 Dalmatians: The Series" (1997) {He Followed Me Home/Love 'Em and Flea 'Em (#1.2)}
Two-Tone: [watches Nanny set a yard sale box down] Yard sales! I love
  yard sales! Actually I hate yard sales, the pros of a yard sale are
  the great bargains but the cons of a yard sale are that everything
  is used, eww yuck
Cadpig: Two-Tone... FOCUS!

Rolly: Anybody want a peanut?... What? It's not like I've offered you
  some of my food before. Okay, so it's been a while.

Cadpig: Uh-oh! I'm having an out-of-bubble experience!

Two-Tone: Hi, Mooch. Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Mooch: It was. I can't see it anymore!

Two-Tone: Oh, Mooch? I just came by to say to you, I have nothing to
  say to you. If I had anything to say to you, I'd say it to Lucky,
  my date tonight at the dance.
Mooch: Say what? You always go out with me!
Two-Tone: Correction. Used to go with you, but you didn't ask me;
  Lucky did.

Two-Tone: Don't hide, Lucky. I like your new look.
Lucky: No, you don't. Mooch is right. You don't want to be seen with
  me.
Two-Tone: Yes, I do! You're still Lucky. I think you're cool in any
  color.
Lucky: Really?
Two-Tone: Yeah.

Rolly: Hey, watch where you're going, you clumsy box!

Cadpig: No glitz, no glory.

Lucky: Come on, Rolly! We gotta hightail it to the museum! We don't
  wanna miss the fire hydrants of the world exhibit!
Rolly: Just send me a post card, Lucky. I'm getting a cramp here.
Cadpig: I'm getting a cramp too! A big giant smile cramp!

Cadpig: What a dramatic day it has been.
Rolly: Yeah. I think I pulled my groin.

Cadpig: Hello, my name is Cadpig, and you two are cows. Name tags
  will help us bond in a formerly yet functional fashion.

Lucky: It's too noisy here!
Rolly: And too hot!
Cadpig: And too... farmy!

Cadpig: I'm having trouble getting centered! It's all this
  unfamiliarity! I need a sense of place!

Jasper Badun: Delivery for the Dearly's.
Horace Badun: And it's not from Cruella De Vil.
[Jasper bonks Horace on the head]
Horace Badun: I mean, it is from Cruella De Vil.
[Jasper bonks Horace on the head]
Horace Badun: I mean, I didn't say anything.

Anita Dearly: Nanny, get some food for the puppies. They're probably
  hungry.
Lucky: Who cares about the food? I'm just glad we're home.
Rolly: I care about the food!

Cadpig: I'm hungry, both physically and mentally. I still miss my
  friends.

Roger Dearly: Of course, I know Cruella's behind all this! Who else
  delivers a message that's dry clean only?


# "101 Dalmatians: The Series" (1997) {Leisure Lawsuit/Purred It Through the Grapevine (#2.4)}
Anita Dearly: Having you join us, Cruella, was such an unexpected
  surprise.
Cruella de Vil: Well, I knew that hang-up on my voicemail must have
  been you calling to invite me.

Roger Dearly: [throws a frisbee] Wish it was that easy to get rid of
  Cruella. Maybe if I tied a dollar around it.

Lucky: Oh, man. Now I've done it. They're gonna lose the farm because
  of me.
Cadpig: Now, now. No pitty-parties, Lucky. It's not all your fault.
  Tell him, guys!
Rolly: No, I think he's right.
Spot: Yeah, it's pretty much all his fault.

Lucky: There's gotta be some way to prove she's faking.
Rolly: You sure she's still faking? I've seen healthier looking
  roadkill.
Lucky: Ah, don't let her fool you. She's a picture of health.

Lt. Pug: If you dirt weasels think this is going to be another day of
  Sunday in the park with Grandpa, then think twice!
Cadpig: Can I think happy thoughts, Lieutenant?

Lt. Pug: True, it's not like the good old days. Back then, you can
  drop a piano on them, or chase them under a steamroller, or paint a
  tunnel on a wall, and they'd slam right into it. I hate cats! Of
  course, now it's a code war, so we can't get away with that
  anymore.
Rolly: This guy's one donut short of a dozen.

Cadpig: I shall wash, but I shan't be clean.

Rolly: Man, if I'd known there was kibble involved, I would have
  fought those sheep single-pawed.

Rolly: He's fearless.
Lucky: He can do anything.
Spot: He's just a dog!
Lucky: He's not just a dog! Go-Go's my hero!

Rolly: [holding a bunny-shaped candy, talking with an effeminate
  voice] I am just a little bunny, and I would not hurt anyone.
[he eats the bunny and takes out another]
Rolly: I am just a little bunny and...
[he eats the bunny and takes out another]
Rolly: I... am... just...
[he eats the bunny and starts devouring the whole box]
Rolly: I need more bunnies! Give me more bunnies! Bunny!

Roger Dearly: Oh, Lucky. You know I can't stay mad at you. You're my
  favorite.
Cadpig: Gee, it's enough to make you want to toss your kibble.

Cadpig: If you keep your face in the sunshine, be sure to wear
  sunglasses.

Cadpig: Oh, I hope Roger picks me! That trophy matches my inner glow.
Spot: Who cares about the trophy? I just wanna bring honor to Dearly
  Farm.
Rolly: Roger isn't picking a chicken, Spot. He's gonna choose a
  dog... with a nose for bones... like me.
Lucky: Dream on, guys. Roger has only one favorite, and we know who
  that is.
Cadpig: Oh, forgive me, chosen one. And if it weren't for my total
  commitment to world peace, I'd kick your sorry little...
Spot: Hey, where are you going, Tripod?
Tripod: Gotta start practicing for the contest. Gotta dig, gotta pump
  up, gotta feel the burn! You guys coming?
Lucky: Nah, I've got... shall we say... connections.

Cruella de Vil: Well, you do now.

Lucky: Let's do it for Roger!
Cadpig: Let's do it for Roger!
Rolly: Let's do it before dinner!

  counter-productive, gut-stripping fears and do what any best friend
  would do: go in there and face Cruella with him!
Rolly: ...or we could just leave.
Cadpig: Sure. We can do that.

Cadpig: Looks like he's having a psychich sugar rush.

Police Officer: [after being covered with blood] Is that ice cream?
  Awesome.

Talent Scout: Hold it yourself, Pops! Whoa! Zinger!

Eye: I live on an Island in Iowa... or Wyoming.
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: No. You can't do that.

Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: We just spent $64,000 in that bar. We're
  going to have to get jobs, to cover up the fact that we rob banks.

Shark: He's rectangley. That's how you'll know him. By his
  rectangularness.

Shark: So let me get this straight.
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Okay.
Shark: I sent you out to pick up a client and take him to a meeting.
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Yes. Yes, sir.
Shark: Instead of that, you took him to a porno set where he starred
  in his very first porno, then you blew him up...
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Wrong. That didn't happen.
Shark: Then you robbed a bank.
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Robbed a bank?
Shark: Threw up on a woman...
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: [incredulous] Whaaaaat?
Shark: And sang to the police.
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: That didn't happen. I didn't do that.
Shark: So what did you do?
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: I did what I wanted to do.
Shark: Which was what, again?
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: All things. Allllll.

Shark: You know what they say? That I'm gonna give you one more
  chance. Do they always say that?
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Oh, yeah. I think I'll give you one more
  chance!

Shark: Bulletproof.

Shark: Are you drunk?
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Not drunk enough.

Shark: [referring to Mouse's job] You didn't do it, did you?
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: No, no I did.
Shark: No no no no no... don't lie. 'Cause you didn't do it, did you?

  an entire beast in the movie, but you think there is. He's that
  good. He's gonna make a mold of your head.

  head. Then I'm gonna take it to Shark. He's gonna think you're
  dead. But you're not... not yet.

  some... so I can drive.

Golden Joe: They are big as hell!
Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: They're also good for busting squirrels out
  of jail. But first... this tank needs some liquor.

Shark: A head your size would burst like an infected kidney... and
  all I'd remember was how warm the juices were that lapped the back
  of my uvula on their trip down to stomach land.

Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Where is everyone? And why?

  partying.

  we must burgle.

  hand and a cold phone in the icebox.

Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: I am enthusiastic... about all beer.

Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: It's called F-Off... to you... so take a
  hint.

Police Officer: Umm, is that your stolen jet outside? With those bags
  of money in the backseat?

Mouse 'Fitz' Fitzgerald: Does it have bullet holes in it?

  was there, we were both there. 'Member?
Eye: I do.

Host: Number 13 Demon Street... I am condemned to live here, to
  suffer on this earth eternally as a punishment for my sin. It is
  said that no greater outrage was ever committed by any mortal but,
  should I find a crime more heinous, my terrible punishment will
  end.

Charlie: Go up to Maine, to New England, but only with your camera!
  Take photographs, rest, change the surroundings. Find yourself
  again.
Donald Powers: I'm not lost, Charlie.
Charlie: If you don't take a rest, I'm afraid you're going to be in

Vince: No. I thought you were perfect, now I realize you're just the

Naomi the Ice Queen: That's not my fault
Vince: You wouldn't get Naomi Campbell stuck in a lift, would you?
Naomi the Ice Queen: So?
Vince: It just makes you very ordinary.

Coach Artie Gunnerson: There was a plane crash off the coast of the
  Isle of Wight in England. Meghan and Sebastian were among the
  passengers on the plane. There were no survivors.

Squib Furlong: I can't believe I was so jealous of him.
Adena Stiles: I should have been on that plane.
Sunny Capuduca: Let's not start that.

Cameron White: [to Squibb] You know what? My mother died while I was
  here. About the worse thing I ever did was not cry about it.

Sunny Capuduca: You complete and total idiot! Could you be any more
  of a useless pathetic dork?
Squib Furlong: Okay, Sunny.
Sunny Capuduca: Oh, I'm Squib and I just designed a new tennis
  racquet. It's so cool, I'm so great.
Squib Furlong: Okay, Sunny, that's good, very convincing.
Sunny Capuduca: Hey, guys, who's the biggest loser who ever walked
  the face of the earth?
Squib Furlong: You can stop now.
Sunny Capuduca: It's Squib, Squib, Squib, Squib, Squib!
Sunny Capuduca: Loser, loser, loser!

Cody Meyers: Rick, are you sure about this?
Rick: What? You want me to go shirtless?

Rick: There are no such thing as idiots, there are just stupid
  people.

Cody Meyers: If love is a game, it has to be the hardest game in the
  world. After all, how can anyone win a game where there's no rules?

Sunny Capuduca: Where did you get your degree? On e-bay?

Coach Artie Gunnerson: Sometimes life throws you curve balls.

Cody Meyers: The best way to honour the dead is to go right on
  living.

Coach Artie Gunnerson: Welcome to Cascadia, here we play to win.

Sunny Capuduca: First of all, I don't care about Squib. He's a rich
  kid who chokes on his dust, takes tennis for granted and smells
  like goat. Second of all, why are you talking to me?
Cody Meyers: Cause you're the only one who doesn't care.

Cody Meyers: Have you ever tried talking? It's like yelling but
  quieter.

Adena Stiles: What happened to hyper-drive girl?
Meghan O'Connor: Drove her outta town.

Coach Artie Gunnerson: Hey. If ever you need to unload, I'm here.
Cody Meyers: I'm sorry, Coach Gunnerson. You wouldn't understand.
Coach Artie Gunnerson: Let me guess - those are of Meghan and
  Sebastien, right?
Cody Meyers: Lucky guess. I took some pictures of them just before
  they left for the Hamsted.

Sunny Capuduca: I just blew off a photo shoot for Vanity Fair. I'm
  doing just fine.

Sunny Capuduca: This is the only time I'll ever go easy on you.
  Capiche?

Sunny Capuduca: Who died and made you boss?

Nate: Truth is beauty, beauty is truth. That's all we know, it's all
  we need to know.

Coach Artie Gunnerson: Thing about living is that there are always
  undeveloped pictures in your future.

Squib Furlong: When you want something bad enough, you have to be
  willing to sacrifice everything.

Squib Furlong: Is that jealousy talking?
Cody Meyers: No, that's a whole lotta reality talking.

Tannis McTaggart: [after the referee made a bad call] What do you
  mean? That was out. Do you understand me? That was as out as Elton
  John on Pride day. Don't tell me it was in when it was out.

Adena Stiles: So where's that psycho chick that I saw out on the
  court and why don't I see her more often?
Tannis McTaggart: I don't know what you're talking about.
Adena Stiles: Come on, Tannis. You're hiding something.
Tannis McTaggart: Okay. Do you think that it's easy to replace Meghan
  O'Connor? All you do is sit around like a log.
Adena Stiles: I know. Tannis, can you help me with something?

Adena Stiles: How could you do this to me? You know I'm not ready for
  a new room-mate. I've known Meghan since I was four.
President Harold Bates: I know, Adena. I'm sorry about this.
Adena Stiles: And you did this without even telling me?
President Harold Bates: I know we should have told you this. Tanis
  wasn't due to arrive until tomorrow.
Adena Stiles: What kind of school is this?
President Harold Bates: I know, Adena.
Adena Stiles: Then you'll get rid of her?
President Harold Bates: I can't do that, Adena. Tannis is a transfer
  student. We're very lucky to have her.

Adena Stiles: Your father is a psychologist, Cody. You should have
  known better than to tell him that.
Cody Meyers: I'm sorry, Adena. It just slipped out.
Adena Stiles: How could you do this to me?
Cody Meyers: All you do is go to class, practice and then you sit
  around your room like a log. I thought having a new room-mate would
  help you to stop thinking about Meghan.
Adena Stiles: Did it ever occur to you that I don't want to stop?
Cody Meyers: Adena!

Rick: Do not try and read the book.
Squib Furlong: All right, already!
Rick: There is *no* book.
Squib Furlong: Rick... Leave me alone!
Rick: How can I leave you alone if I'm not even here?
Squib Furlong: Shut up!
Rick: Good, Squib. Anger is a tool, let's use it!

Rick: Someone needs a hug.
Squib Furlong: Get off me!
Rick: Emotional outburst is key to the evolution of the grieving
  process.
Squib Furlong: Don't get all Dr. Phil on me, I'm fine.

Hartley Myers: When I was your age, I spent a lot of time being funny
  too.
Squib Furlong: I don't believe it.
Hartley Myers: Well, it's true. I was quite the ham.
Squib Furlong: No, I mean, I don't believe it that you were once my
  age.

Cameron White: [watching Tanis's legs go by] Who dat?
Squib Furlong: That's Tanis McTaggart. She's a new student.
Cameron White: From the A group?
Squib Furlong: Where else?
Cameron White: Did we pick the right group to be in or what?

Rick: Perhaps I can be of assistance. My mother says that I have an
  IQ that rivals that of Alfred Einstein.
Squib Furlong: It's Albert...
Rick: Whatever. The point is, Uncle Rick is here for you.

Meghan O'Connor: It's not about you winning, Adena. It's about why
  you always want to.

Meghan O'Connor: Take me.
Sebastien Dube: I thought you said you weren't a groupie?

Adena Stiles: What?
Cameron White: Nothing... I just never noticed before... your eyes.
Adena Stiles: Thanks they came with my face.

Adena Stiles: You may be being driven, I'm just not sure who's behind
  the wheel.

Jennifer Wiley: I want you to come up with an invention. Now I don't
  expect anything to actually work, but what I am looking for is
  creativity. So let your imaginations run wild.
Squib Furlong: How about an invention to make this class less boring?

Cody Meyers: I don't know what to say!
Squib Furlong: Ok, then I'll do all the talking. It's time for me to
  stop hiding all the stupid gunk and step up to be a man, it's time
  for me to say that every time I close my eyes, all I see is your
  face and my stupid hair and my stupid chat and my stupid fans don't
  add up to anything. I would give up everything in a heartbeat for
  you!
Cody Meyers: I thought you were the kind of guy who keeps bottled up?
Squib Furlong: Things change!

Cody Meyers: Hey, at least you were able to break her serve this
  time.
Adena Stiles: Yeah, only when she decided to play that set
  blindfolded.

Sunny Capuduca: Hey, buzzard! Keep circling around, they might pity
  you.
Squib Furlong: Sunny, it was Buzzsaw! Buzz - Saw!
Sunny Capuduca: Oh, yeah, Buzzsaw, 'cause your career is sawdust!

Tannis McTaggart: Sunny, calm down!
Sunny Capuduca: Calm is for losers, Anger fuels my game and by the
  way, you're next!

Sunny Capuduca: The loser collects the balls.

Rick: So, Cody, want to hang out sometime?
Cody Meyers: Sure Rick, I'd like that.
Rick: So that means we can go steady?
Cody Meyers: No, Rick. *Friends*.
Rick: Friends, right, but I'm a boy, then I'd be your boy friend.
Cody Meyers: No, Rick.... just friends.

  both be awake. But since you did wake me up, I can't wake up from
  this nightmare so i can't wake you up! So we're both still asleep.

Little Dog: In what way?

Little Dog: There are plenty of hamsters in the sea. I just hope they

Hollywood: Isn't that cute? BUT IT'S WRONG!

Big Dog: Listen, kid, love is the only chance for happiness you'll
  ever get in this life, and if you're going to let a little thing
  like rejection stand in your way, baby, you might as well stay
  right there on the ground, because people are going to be walking

  wedding ring. All I'm doing is taking mine upfront, and in cash.

Lauren Carlson: Part of what? All I'm doing is taking care of my
  family. No ones getting hurt.

Lauren Carlson: Okay, so what happens now?
Officer Judy Hoffs: We book you for suspicion of conspiracy in the
  Belmont robberies. We've got a pretty good case. You'll probably be
  sent to a J.D. school.

Lauren Carlson: It's getting kind of hot in here, huh? You wanna get
  out of these clothes huh baby?

  Just let me try talking to her first before we arrest her.
Captain Adam Fuller: Wait, wait, wait. I want to know what she's done
  to deserve this special handling besides lie to you from the start?
Officer Judy Hoffs: Her mother's a pro, her father's non existent.
  The girl probably was raised in the back room of a massage parlor,
  she never had a chance.

  workers.

  a rap as a very tough guy. I guess the P.T.A. figure, it would work
  out.
Officer Judy Hoffs: But it didn't.

Captain Adam Fuller: The kids name is Reggie Brooks. Guys like him
  don't handle being humiliated. They lose the rep, their gangs take
  a walk. We put out a warrant for Brooks right after a pipe bomb
  blew off the hood of Madigan's car. He disappeared. Reggie is a
  three time loser as a juvy, last week he turned eighteen. So this
  will be the first time that he's been suspected of a felony as an
  adult.
Officer Judy Hoffs: What about the bloods?
Captain Adam Fuller: Death threats, angry acts from the gang members
  for skipping school. My bet is they're just waiting on the word
  from Reggie to take that shot.

Captain Adam Fuller: Now remember you gotta get close to Madigan and
  I.D. the gang members.

Off. Tom Hanson #2: No I'm not
Off. Doug Penhall: Oh you gotta be... You know it's very unhealthy to
  keep this stuff couped up, you should let some steam off get it off
  your chest.
Off. Tom Hanson #2: Alright! Alright. I sharpen my own pencils pal,
  understand? Noone sharpens my pencils but me... Noone
Off. Doug Penhall: Then you are a little mad...
Off. Tom Hanson #2: Of course I'm mad you shot me in the ass! and
  I'll never forgive you okay? There.
Off. Doug Penhall: Oh Wonderful, Terrific! One little mistake and
  you're gonna keep a grudge over me for the rest of my life?
  Fabulous!

Off. Doug Penhall: You know... I had them move the desks closer
  together, so you wouldn't strain your voice if you call for me

Off. Doug Penhall: I hope you don't have one already... Tada!
Off. Tom Hanson #2: It's very nice... What is it?
Off. Doug Penhall: It's a pillow.
Off. Tom Hanson #2: Where's the rest of it?
Off. Doug Penhall: No, it's supposed to be like that... It's for guys
  who have...
Off. Tom Hanson #2: What?
Off. Doug Penhall: Hemroids.
Off. Tom Hanson #2: You hope I don't already have one? Make this go
  away
Off. Doug Penhall: Okay... I'll put it over here, in case you change
  your mind. It's right here alright?


# "21 Jump Street" (1987) {The Worst Night of Your Life (#1.5)}
Off. Tom Hanson #2: Hey, Penhall, did you go to your prom?
Off. Doug Penhall: What is that a trick question? Hanson, I went to
  my first prom when I was eleven.
Officer Harry Truman Ioki: Well, I never went to mine. I guess when I
  was in high school, I never believed it was the last time I was
  gonna be there.
Off. Doug Penhall: Ioki, what do you think we do all day?

[first lines]
Margie: I don't think we should do this Jane, I don't.
Jane Kinney: Of course we shouldn't, that's why we're doing it.

Off. Doug Penhall: Hanson, Hanson, Hanson. I'm trying to save your
  life here, but you're going to have to give me a little help.
  Bowling? I once knew a kid who's father was a bowler. He ran away
  from home. He was three. His mother helped him!
Officer Harry Truman Ioki: Listen, Penhall, maybe there's still time.
  You know, maybe Thomas here isn't any good.
Off. Tom Hanson #2: You want to know what my handicap is?
Off. Doug Penhall: Yeah, bowling!

Off. Doug Penhall: What do you want me to do? Kill myself?
Off. Tom Hanson #2: Yes!
Captain Richard Jenko: [as the guys come in dressed for the prom]
  Well, well, well. Far out. Looks like we've got a Japanese Elvis
  Presley, a pimp, and the butler.
Off. Tom Hanson #2: With the budget we've got, you're lucky we could
  afford to rent the pants.
Captain Richard Jenko: Maybe you should go without the pants, tell
  them you're a poor butler.

Off. Tom Hanson #2: [after bowling a strike] Oh! Another slam-a-rino
  for the Kingpins! Yeah!
Girl Sitting With Penhall: Your friend?
Off. Doug Penhall: [chuckling] Yeah well, sort of I guess.
Girl Sitting With Penhall: He's very good, isn't he?
Off. Doug Penhall: If you like guys who say "slam-a-rino", yeah

Officer Doug Penhall: What do you got? A Leash?

Officer Doug Penhall: It's different when you're a natural.
Officer Tom Hanson: That's right, you're an actor now.

Laurel Peterson: Would you call this a case of life imitating art?
Officer Tom Hanson: Yeah, sure.

Pee-Wee Herman: No, sometimes I act really silly.

Pee-Wee Herman: We sure picked a dumb time to not be invisible.

Holdup Man: Who are you?
Mary: I'm Gladys Knight and these are my Pips.

[Julian asks Mary about painting the master bedroom]
Julian: It's House and Condo's Color of the Month.
Mary: I don't care if it's Baskin Robbins flavor of the month! You
  are not painting our bedroom passion purple!
Lester: Passion Purple, Are you Crazy?
Travis: Cheap! $3.95 a gallon and they threw in the beret!
Julian: Balderdash!

Sandra: Calvin, You're still a boy.
Calvin: [Before Sandra screams when Calvin tries to kiss her]
  Hopefully I won't be after tonight!
Sandra: Don't move, breathe deep, think about Church!

Tiffany: Um, Brenda, can I get Calvin's autograph?
Brenda: [after hearing Tiffany's request] Bye Tiffany!

Sandra: [to Rose after she sneezed and destroyed an old map] You
  really blew it now Rose!

[Sandra is paying rent to Rose]
Sandra: Three months' rent.
Rose Lee: Good, now you're only two months behind!

Sandra: By this summer, I can buy anything I want. I wonder if the
  Washington Redskins are for sale.

Sandra: [after receiving a bouquet of flowers] Oh, Mary! You know
  what? These are probably from Tony apologizing for last night.
Mary: You see there? All upset for nothing.
Sandra: [reading the attached note] Oh! Dear Snookums, please accept
  these flowers as well as an invitation to dinner Friday night at La
  Bamba! Love, Tony!
Mary: La Bamba? Child, that place is so expensive, even the doorman
  takes credit cards.
Sandra: [laughs] Oh, look, Mary, isn't this cute? There's a P.S!
  Please don't tell... Sandra. [voice changes to an angry tone upon
  realizing the flowers are for her roommate, Donna]
Donna Dalton: Hi! [seeing flowers in Sandra's hand] Oh, those are so
  pretty!
Sandra: They're yours.
Donna Dalton: Aw! [grabbing the flowers] From who?
Sandra: From Tony.
Donna Dalton: Aw! I wonder where I should put them?
Sandra: [menacingly moves towards Donna] I know exact...
Mary: [while pulling Sandra back] Uh! Uh! Um!
Donna Dalton: I-Is there something wrong?
Sandra: [mockingly] I-Is there something wrong? Yeah, there's
  something wrong! You obviously made a mistake in judgement! Nobody,
  I mean, nobody messes with Sandra Clark!
Donna Dalton: What are you so upset about? You got a 100 guys calling
  you!
Sandra: [defiantly] Well, today's it's 99.

Rose Lee: Mary, now you know I am a very understanding person.
Sandra: HA!
Rose Lee: But I told Sandra if she didn't have that rent money by the
  end of the week, she was out of here!
Sandra: And after all the favors I've done for her!
Rose Lee: Favors? What favors?
Sandra: What about last week? You were feeling kind of low. You spent
  all that money on a new dress and you didn't know if it was
  attractive. You came to me for help, and I looked you straight in
  the eye and said it was gorgeous. [smugly] I lied, Rose.

Rose Lee: [while interviewing applicants to be Sandra's roommate]
  Hello, I'm Rose Holloway, the landlady here, and this is Miss
  Sandra Clark.
Muffin Tee Matthews: [in a Southern accent] Nice to meet you! Muffin
  Tee Matthews
Sandra: Muffin?
Muffin Tee Matthews: Oh, that's not my real name. I just use it for
  the beauty pageants.
Sandra: Beauty pageants?
Muffin Tee Matthews: And may I say that living with you would be so
  fufilling and rewarding!
Sandra: What are you, Miss Congeniality?
Muffin Tee Matthews: No. I'm Miss Tuscaloosa. And next year, we're
  going after Miss America. My manager says I'm a perfect 10!
Sandra: Oh, what a shame!
Muffin Tee Matthews: Why?
Sandra: Rose has it in her lease: Two perfect 10's can't share the
  same apartment. [grabbing Muffin's hand] Oh, I'm so sorry! Oh,
  thank you! See you on the runway... Miss Tuscaloosa! [pushes Muffin
  out of the door]

Mary: [while watching Donna walking, laughing, and flirting with two
  guys] Um, Madonna? I mean... Donna. I think we need to talk.
Donna Dalton: Sure, Aunt Mary, what about?
Mary: [referring to Donna's new look and attitude] About your...
  your, um... difference.
Donna Dalton: Oh, I know, isn't it wonderful? I feel like a whole new
  person! I've never had this much fun in my entire life! I feel so
  good and confident about myself! Coming to see you and Uncle Lester
  has been the best thing that's ever happened to me! Oh, I love it
  here! [kisses Mary on the cheek and walks inside the apartment]
Pearl Shay: Well, you sure straightened her out.

Rose Lee: [referring to Sandra] Mary, this woman has got me at the
  end of my rope!
Sandra: [muttering] It should be around your neck.

Alexandria DeWitt: And this must be Brenda.
Brenda: Yes, Ma'am. I mean, hi.
Alexandria DeWitt: Brenda, this should be fun. Do you like music?
Brenda: Oh, I love music!
Alexandria DeWitt: Good, I brought my entire collection of the Three
  B's.
Brenda: What group is that?
Alexandria DeWitt: Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms.
Brenda: Oh, I like rap: Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince?
Alexandria DeWitt: Oh, honey, you'll grow out of it.

Alexandria DeWitt: And you must be...
Sandra: Oh, I'm Madame Curie.
Alexandria DeWitt: Oh, you're much prettier than she.
Sandra: Ah! Give this kid a Nobel prize!
Alexandria DeWitt: Oh, she won one of those for the betterment of

Sandra: Oh, gee! We both work for the same cause!

Alexandria DeWitt: Now Brenda, would you kindly show me to my room?

Jack Bauer: I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest
  day of my life.

Nina Myers: Jack, if you kill me, you won't know who I work for. You
  think I work for Drazen, but I don't!
Jack Bauer: I trusted you, Nina...
Nina Myers: I was just doing my job.
Jack Bauer: Your job? My wife and daughter almost died today! How
  many people that trusted you lost their life today because you were
  doing your job? Walsh, or Jamey? Ellis? How many others?
Nina Myers: How many people died because of you, Jack?

Kate Warner: [while being tortured by Sayed Ali for information] How
  can I tell you what I don't know?

[from Season 5 preview]
Jack Bauer: If you don't tell me what I want to know, then it'll just
  be a question of how much you want it to hurt.

Jack Bauer: The only reason that you're conscious right now is
  because I don't want to carry you.

Lynn McGill: We met at that memory management lecture?
Chloe: If you say so.

Chloe: [as Jack strangles an FBI officer and a horrified teenage boy
  looks on] Don't worry... he's really good at this.

[from preview for Season 5]
Jack Bauer: [angry] When I'm finished with you, you're gonna wish
  that you felt this good again.

[after Jack Bauer's team attacks the Chinese Consulate]
President Palmer: It was a covert operation, not dissimilar to those
  carried out by countries on a routine basis around the world.
Charles Logan: Don't give me a social studies lesson, David. We
  marched onto Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals, and
  in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

Navi Araz: [Dina is leaving to get Behrooz] Who was on the phone?
Dina Araz: It was nothing important.
Navi Araz: Liar! [Navi grabs Dina] What did Behrooz do?
Dina Araz: No. What did you do? Did you give the order?
Navi Araz: Behrooz was not committed. It was just a matter of time
  before he turned against us.
Dina Araz: You order Tariq to kill him-to kill our own son. [Dina
  slaps Navi] No! [Dina slaps him again] No! [Dina slaps him again]
  No! You sick...
Navi Araz: [Navi and Dina struggle, until he pins her against the
  wall] [shouts] Where is Tariq?
Dina Araz: Behrooz killed him!
Navi Araz: That's impossible.
Dina Araz: Because you think he's weak? He's not.
Navi Araz: Nothing, nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be
  done-not him, not you. Where is he now?
Dina Araz: Why? What are you going to do? [pause] You're hurting me!
Navi Araz: I will do more than that. Now you listen to me, woman. You
  will do exactly as you told him. You will pick him up in a half an
  hour.

Jack Bauer: You are gonna tell me what I wanna know, it's just a
  matter of how much you want it to hurt.

Bill Buchanan: I want you tell me exactly what you've been doing here
  and for how long.
Jack Bauer: Understand this, Bill. I don't work for you any more.

Bill Buchanan: We're in an active code, Chole. We don't have time for
  your personality disorder.

James Heller: I am the Secretary of Defense of the United States of
  America. You will listen to me!

Chapelle: I didn't ask your opinion.
Chase: Well, I'm giving it to you anyway.

Jack Bauer: Tell me where the bomb is or I will kill your son.

Tony Almeida: I should be there with you.
Michelle Dessler: [softly] You are...

Navi Araz: [Navi hangs up the phone] The override has taken control
  of the nuclear power plants.
Dina Araz: What about Behrooz? What about our son?
Navi Araz: [pause, sighs] We have to be strong now, we'll mourn him
  when this is over.
Dina Araz: [Navi exits. Dina's cell phone rings] Hello?
Behrooz Araz: Mom?
Dina Araz: Behrooz? Are you all right?
Behrooz Araz: Tariq tried to kill me. He was going to shoot me. I had
  to defend myself.
Dina Araz: What did you do?
Behrooz Araz: I killed him. You can't let Father know.
Dina Araz: Why not?
Behrooz Araz: Because Father's the one who told Tariq to do it. He
  wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie.
Dina Araz: Behrooz, that's not possible. Your father would never want
  to hurt you.
Behrooz Araz: It's true. Mom, I don't know what to do. You have to
  help me.
Dina Araz: Where are you now?
Behrooz Araz: I'm near the Metrolink station on Lassen in Chatsworth
Dina Araz: Are you using Tariq's car?
Behrooz Araz: Yes.
Dina Araz: Hide it. I'll pick you up there in a half hour.
Behrooz Araz: Hurry.

[to Audrey, who was held by the Chinese for a few months]
Jack Bauer: I know what it's like to feel like it's never going to
  end.

Osterlind: They're grounding flights from LAX.
Stephen Saunders: Did all the couriers get out with their vials?
Osterlind: New York, Washington, San Francisco made it through;
  they're on their way. I re-routed Las Vegas; our man is driving
  there now. But we missed Chicago and Cleveland.
Stephen Saunders: Did you revise the casualty projections?
Osterlind: Of course. [hands him folder] Here they are.
Stephen Saunders: Just give me the number.
Osterlind: Two to five million dead within the first 48 hours.
Stephen Saunders: [shrugs] Good enough.

[repeated line]
Jack Bauer: Damn it!

Jack Bauer: Shut up, stupid!

Jack Bauer: You're a good kid, Chase. But let's get one thing
  straight. Don't you ever come into my office and talk to me that
  way again. Do you understand me?

Chapelle: [whilst interrogating Gael] Talk to me, you sonuvabitch!

Chapelle: Chloe's a pain in the ass!

Chapelle: I'd like nothing more than to hang you as a traitor and
  watch you jerk until you die.

Jack Bauer: Oh, my God, what did you do? What have you done? [shouts]
  What have you done?

[Jack Bauer is preparing to execute Ryan Chapelle]
Chapelle: There's no way around this, right Jack? We don't have any
  outs here.
Jack Bauer: Not that I can see. [cocks gun]
Chapelle: [as a tear runs down his face] Wait! All right. Let me do
  this myself. At least give me... the dignity of-of taking m-my own
  life; that's something you can do.
Jack Bauer: No, Ryan, I can't do that.
Chapelle: Yes, you can! You were right back at CTU to put me under
  watch. I wasn't going out for a cigarette, I was trying to bolt.
  But I know this has to happen.
Jack Bauer: I can't take that chance.
Chapelle: I'm giving you my word, Jack. I won't run, I swear. I-I-I'd
  be lying if I said I wasn't scared, but I'm not gonna run. I
  couldn't live with myself, knowing that I was responsible for the
  deaths of all those people. [voice breaking] You gotta believe me.

Michelle Dessler: You scared the hell out of me.
Tony Almeida: [laughing] I know... I'm sorry.

Paramedic: Take off your clothes. [after Mason has been exposed to
  radiation]
George Mason: Aren't you going to buy me dinner first?

First Lady Martha Logan: I look like a wedding cake!

Chloe: OK, when the alert level goes down, and the terrorists have
  been caught, we can have some chamomile tea and I'll tell you all
  my secrets.

Chloe: I was unfairly harsh to you a few minutes ago, I didn't mean
  anything.
Spencer Wolf: All right. Apology accepted.
Chloe: It wasn't really an apology, it was more of an observation.

Jack Bauer: [Jack has shot and wounded Nina] You don't have any more
  useful information, do you?
Nina Myers: [weakly] I do...
Jack Bauer: [notices Nina is inching for her gun] No, you don't.
  [fires and kills Nina]

Mandy: [once she realizes CTU knows she and Tony are still alive
  after their supposed deaths] Looks like my neighbors died for
  nothing.

President Palmer: [asking about Alan Milliken's death] What happened,
  Sherry?
Sherry Palmer: I went... to the house. [sees David's look, raises a
  hand slightly] to speak to Julia. Alan interrupted us... there was
  an argument... and... he had a heart attack.

Audrey Heller Raines: Jack, you are not going to do this. You are not
  going to torture my brother!

Bill Buchanan: Chloe, we don't have time for your personality
  disorder!

Edgar Stiles: [His last words] Chloe...

Jack Bauer: [while holding President Logan at gunpoint] A year and a
  half ago I was warned my life was in danger. I was told the only
  way to survive was to create the illusion that I was dead. I had
  the deceive people I cared about. My daughter will never forgive
  me. Now that I see the depth of your corruption there is no doubt
  that source of danger was you. David Palmer was a great man and a
  great president, but he was also my friend. He tried to warn me
  about you and now he is dead. Other people tried to help me and
  they are dead. So Mr. Logan, I really have nothing left to lose.

Audrey Heller Raines: Not... another... word!

Charles Logan: Agent Clark, I want you to arrest these men and get
  them the hell out of here!
Agent Clark: We have our orders, sir.
Charles Logan: You take!... You take your orders from me!
Agent Clark: Not anymore.

Christopher Henderson: [Holds Jack at gunpoint] Hold it Jack! You
  weren't really going to let me go, were you?
Jack Bauer: No. [Henderson tries to shoot him, but the gun is empty.
  He looks at the clip, realizing Jack has outsmarted him. He faintly
  smiles at Jack]
Christopher Henderson: Good for you.
Jack Bauer: You are responsible for the deaths of David Palmer, Tony
  Almeida, and Michelle Dessler. They were friends of mine.
Christopher Henderson: That's what happens. [Jack shoots him twice]

Jack Bauer: I know you think you're doing the right thing, [raising
  his voice] but this is not going to happen.
Kim: Somebody has to do it!
Jack Bauer: Someone will, not you!
Kim: [raising her voice] I'm the best match!
Jack Bauer: [raising his voice even more] You're not a field
  operative!
Kim: I have weapons training. This is decoy work. Saunders' people
  won't even come close to me.
Jack Bauer: [shouting] Kim, you don't know what you're talking about.
  If everything was to go right in this scenario, which not a chance
  I'm willing to take!
Kim: [shouting] You're not taking it! I am!
Jack Bauer: [grabs Kim and puts her up against the wall] The reason
  why you've got this job, [shouting] the reason why I GAVE you this
  job is so that I could make sure you'd be safe!
Kim: [voice breaking] I took this job because I wanted it, not
  because you wanted me here. I know that this is hard for you, but
  this is not your decision. This is my job; better yet, my duty. I'm
  gonna be safe. [crying] But I'm doing it.

Edgar Stiles: You're the best analyst we've got.
Chloe: I know.

Sherry Palmer: We've had a hard day, but when you look at it in
  perspective, you'll realize I was acting in your best interest. And
  I know you're so mad at me.
President Palmer: I'm not mad at you.
Sherry Palmer: Oh, good.
President Palmer: I feel sorry for you.
Sherry Palmer: You feel sorry for me?
President Palmer: You've lost touch of what it is to be a friend... a
  parent... a wife. After today, I never want to see you again.
Sherry Palmer: David!
President Palmer: Please, Sherry, I've heard it all before. And I
  don't care what this may do to my candidacy. And it's not because I
  don't want to be President. I do. I just don't think you're fit to
  be the first lady.
Sherry Palmer: Do you really think you can just leave me? Don't you
  think for a second it'll be that easy!
President Palmer: Secret Service will escort you back to Washington
  when you're ready. [turns away from her and walks towards the room
  exit]
Sherry Palmer: [screaming after David, who is ignoring her rantings]
  David, you don't just walk away from me! David, you can't do this
  without me! David, I'm talking to you! [a secret Service Agent
  stops her from following after David Palmer after he leaves the
  room] Get your hands off of me!

[from Season 5 trailer]
Jack Bauer: [gun aimed at someone off screen] See you in hell.
  [fires]

Tony Almeida: Michelle?
Michelle Dessler: Yeah?
Tony Almeida: [sobbing] I can't believe I almost lost you.

Woman: Don't you have a gun?
Chloe: I work with computers!

Jack Bauer: [Jack is about to execute Chappelle] Ryan, is there
  anyone you'd like to talk to?
Ryan Chappelle: To say goodbye?
Jack Bauer: To say whatever you have to.
Ryan Chappelle: I have a brother I haven't talked to in years... I
  don't have that many friends, only the people I work with. So,
  no... there's no-one.

Ryan Chappelle: [terrified, knowing he is about to die] My legs are
  shaking...
Jack Bauer: [hesitates for a moment] I've got you.

Mandy: [holding a gun to Tony's head] You really have what it takes
  to shoot him while you're looking him in the eye?
Jack Bauer: Yes.
Mandy: I believe you. So what's to stop me from shooting him?

Chase: Let me be upfront with you, Jack. I look up to you, and I'd
  even take a bullet for you. Instead, I'm holding a mirror right in
  front of your face. I know what they did to you when you were
  undercover with the Salazars. If something goes wrong, I'm always
  there when you need me.
Jack Bauer: Mind your own business Chase.
Chase: Today is NOT the day to prove that everything is okay and this
  will be a rough day. Get your head straight man, and do what you
  got to do.

Jack Bauer: [to Joseph Prado, after breaking every finger in his
  hand] This will help you with the pain.
[knocks him unconscious]

[Chloe had to shoot a man in self-defense]
Edgar Stiles: You okay?
Chloe: I'm fine.
Edgar Stiles: Is there anything I can do?
Chloe: I said I'm fine! I am trying not to think about what happened,
  I'm gonna process it later, okay?
Edgar Stiles: Sure, fine. [walks away]
Chloe: Edgar, I appreciate your concern. I really do. Just when I
  shot that guy, I thought I'd go all fetal position. But the truth
  is, I didn't feel anything. At all. I hope I'm not some kind of a
  psychopath.
Edgar Stiles: Well, he *was* trying to kill you.
Chloe: Yeah, but still!
Edgar Stiles: Maybe it's a delayed reaction kinda thing. Maybe you'll
  freak out about it in a few days.
Chloe: I hope so.

[getting ready to transport Victor]
Jack Bauer: [goes to over to Victor] Get up. [doesn't budge]
[explodes] Get up!

Nina Myers: So, Ed, how are ya?
Agent Ed Miller: Don't bother, Nina. I'm here because I have to be,
  not because I'm your friend.
Nina Myers: Well, you're here because they think after I help stop
  the bomb, Jack will try to kill me. Which, of course, he will. What
  if you can't stop him? I mean, no offense, but Ed, let's face it:
  you're no match for Jack. You're just not that ruthless. So he
  manages to get around you and pull the trigger. What happens then?
  Because of the pardon, he knows if he kills me, he'll spend the
  rest of his life in jail.
Agent Ed Miller: Jack, if you have some way to shut her up I'm not
  thinkin' of...
Nina Myers: Of course, Jack's mind is thinking, "That's not such a
  bad deal." Small price to pay to avenge his wife's death. But what
  about his daughter? Is he thinking about her? She's already lost
  one parent. If he kills me, she'll have no one. Jack knows I'm
  right. He should just use me to stop the bomb, and then go home to
  Kim. She needs you, Jack.

Marwan: [to Chort who has Jack Bauer at gunpoint] Kill him.

[Syed Ali has said he's willing to die]
Jack Bauer: The only way you're going to die is if I kill you. Your
  bomb's not going off.

[Chase gives a warning to Nina regarding lying to Jack]
Chase: If he realizes that you're toying with him, he will kill you.
Nina Myers: Is that so?

Ramon Salazar: I'm concerned about you, Jack. The things you did to
  get me here. You'll never be the same.

Jack Bauer: How long have you been playing me?

Stephen Saunders: So, Michael... tell me how it went down in Mexico.
  [Amador slowly looks at Saunders] You didn't think I would find
  out?
Michael Amador: I didn't think you needed to know... as long as you
  got what you wanted.
Stephen Saunders: You were stupid enough to believe that Jack Bauer
  had turned against CTU, and now you've got every intelligence
  agency in the country after you.
Michael Amador: Bauer's story checked out.
Stephen Saunders: Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer. What you
  did in Mexico, it was stupid, it was greedy, and it may have cost
  me my advantage.
Michael Amador: Alvers and I still expect to be paid. [Amador
  connects with the bank via laptop]
Stephen Saunders: The authorization code is 7QV78.
Michael Amador: [Amador enters the code to reveal 10 million dollars
  in the account] This is only half!
Stephen Saunders: I'll release the balance after I have confirmation
  on the hotel.
Michael Amador: The deal was we get paid in full!
Stephen Saunders: The deal changed when you went down to Mexico
  [pauses] Now, after you've hit the hotel, you'll get the rest of
  your money. [Saunders gives one vial of the virus to Alvers and
  leaves]

Alan Milliken: [to Sherry, who is snooping up on something he has
  covered up] You come into my house? After everything I've done for
  your family? I've made your children's father the President of the
  United States!
Sherry Palmer: Wait a minute, whatever you did to help David was
  *not* for the benefit of my children. Let's get that straight.
  You're just a small man, Alan, who lords his money over his friends
  because that's all you have, that's all you are! Why do you think
  your wife had to go out and find another man?
Alan Milliken: Don't you *talk* to me like this!
Sherry Palmer: Because you're *not* one! Not one woman in her right
  mind would find you attractive without your wealth, Alan! That's
  what people want from you. [Alan gasps, he is having a heart attack
  while Sherry continues] That's all Julia wants from you. And I'm
  supposed to be afraid of you? You think I'm scared of you? You're
  just a little boy, Alan! A pathetic, scrawny, sickly little boy!
Alan Milliken: [gasping] Julia, my pills. My pills!
Sherry Palmer: [Julia grabs the pills, going to Alan as Sherry grabs
  her arm] No, don't!
Julia Milliken: What are you doing?
Sherry Palmer: Don't!
Julia Milliken: Sherry?
Sherry Palmer: Don't!
Alan Milliken: Julia! Julia!
Sherry Palmer: This is your way out!
Alan Milliken: [shakes, gasping] Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia!
Alan Milliken: [falls out of his wheelchair, crawling to the counter,
  grabbing his pills, trying to take them. He stops shaking,
  collapses on the floor and dies]

Martha Logan: [after she learns President Logan wants to give
  terrorists the route to the Russian President's motorcade] You are
  the President of the United States! My God! You're talking about
  murder!

Sherry Palmer: Why don't you just say what's on your mind? You don't
  want me here.
Lynne Kresge: Mrs. Palmer, I...
Sherry Palmer: No, you don't want me here! So let's just quit playing
  games?
Lynne Kresge: How dare you speak to me like this? I was appointed by
  the President of the United States of America because of my
  qualifications in foreign policy and crisis management, and I don't
  know what kind of credentials you have that make you think you can
  lecture me. Fine. You don't want to play games? I don't like you.
  And I don't like you being here.
Sherry Palmer: Well... *now* we're communicating.

Teddy Hanlin: Hiya, Jack. Haven't seen you since you put my partner
  away.

Carl Webb: Before you're done crucifying me, save some nails for your
  wife.

Tony Almeida: Remember that time we came into work together about a
  month ago? Mason made some wisecrack remark, and you came up with
  this really great BS story, early breakfast meeting with District
  3. I was really impressed with how convincing a liar you were.

Michelle Dessler: I can't spend another day without you... I'm ready
  to leave here, I'm ready to go with you...

Chase: You're right Ryan! And after you shoot Jack down, you can
  personally explain that to the president!

Jack Bauer: I'm gonna need a hacksaw.

Jack Bauer: That's the problem with people like you, George. You want
  results, but you never want to get your hands dirty. I'd start
  rolling up your sleeves.

Jack Bauer: He shouldn't have been playing with A-dults.

Eddie: Jack's back.

Eddie: Today we're going to turn a government building into a
  cemetery.

[some of the symptoms of inhaling plutonium]
Paramedic: Well, there's hair loss...
George Mason: I'm already used to that.

Marie: Reza, you really are very sweet.

Tony Almeida: So, uh, what are we saying here? If we save LA from a
  nuclear bomb, then you and I can get together for dinner and a
  movie?

Nina Myers: I never meant for this to be personal.
Jack Bauer: It felt pretty personal when you killed my wife.

[Nina is holding Jack at gunpoint]
Nina Myers: You didn't think it would end like this didn't you?
Jack Bauer: This isn't over yet.

George Mason: Believe it or not, I used to want to be a teacher. A
  long time ago. You know why I didn't? DOD offered me more money.
  That's how I made my decision. So I made myself miserable. And I
  made everybody else around me miserable. For an extra five thousand
  dollars a year. That was my price.
Michelle Dessler: I'm sorry.
George Mason: You know, Michelle, I'm not a big advice giver, but
  under the circumstances... Don't wait around for your life to
  happen to you. Find something that makes you happy, and do it.
  Because everything else is all just background noise.

George Mason: So what are you gonna do tomorrow? If the bomb doesn't
  go off. Thought about it?

[to Nina while he has a gun to her head]
Jack Bauer: You are going to tell me everything I want to know or I
  swear to God I will hurt you before I kill you, and no one will be
  able to stop me.

Jack Bauer: Do you really think you can do this?
George Mason: Yes.
Jack Bauer: You are absolutely sure you can do this?
George Mason: Jack, I'm supposed to do this.

George Mason: You still have a life, Jack. You wanna be a real hero,
  here's what you do. You get back down there and you put the pieces
  together. You find a way to forgive yourself for what happened to
  your wife. You make things right with your daughter, and you go on
  serving your country. That'd take some real guts.

Jack Bauer: You inhaled plutonium, George.
George Mason: So.
Jack Bauer: So I'm not the only person who shouldn't be here today.

[pointing his gun in the direction of a noise behind him]
Jack Bauer: Don't move.
George Mason: Hey, hey. Service is bad enough on this flight; you
  don't have to shoot me.

Kate Warner: So the plane has some kind of automatic pilot or
  something?
Agent Tom Baker: Actually no, it will have to be flown out to a very
  precise location.
Kate Warner: So the pilot...? Oh my god, who's it going to be?
Agent Tom Baker: Jack Bauer

Tony Almeida: Where the hell do you think you're going, Jack?
Jack Bauer: Tony, I don't have time to explain right now.
[Tony pulls out his gun and points it at Jack]
Tony Almeida: Let's find the time.

Jack Bauer: The Sunday before you killed my wife... Teri and I went
  to the boardwalk in Venice just watching all the rollerbladers and
  musicians, laughing at the crazy people, spending time together.
  And Teri sees this sno-cone stand. She giggles like a kid. She
  takes off running, she wants to get in line, she wants one. I
  remember I was watching her, I was just... I couldn't help myself.
  When I look up at her she's talking to this old lady in line behind
  her and the two of them are laughing, and I'm thinking to myself,
  how the hell does she do that. How does she strike up a
  conversation with an absolute stranger? And they just start
  laughing. Like they'd been friends forever. That's a GIFT. I
  remember thinking, God, I wish I could do that. But I can't. That
  was Teri. My wife. That's what you took from this world, Nina.
  That's what you took from me, and my daughter. I just wanted you to
  know that.

Jack Bauer: Kim, I want you to point the gun at his chest and pull
  the trigger now.

President Palmer: Let's skip the sound bytes and cut straight to the
  chase.

President Palmer: I'm the president Mike. You do not call me by my
  first name.

Jack Bauer: There are things in this world which are out of our
  control. Sometimes we like to blame ourselves for them so we can
  try to make sense out of them.

Ryan Chappelle: So what's up, my friend?
Tony Almeida: Well, it's like this, Ryan: Either fire me, or get out
  of my chair.

President Palmer: What are you trying to do? Start a war with the
  Middle East?
Roger Stanton: No.
President Palmer: Then what?
Roger Stanton: Your defense policy is too passive. You need more
  resources...
President Palmer: You're trying to hijack my presidency.
Roger Stanton: No, no, no. But, I'd like to give it some balls.

Jack Bauer: Honey I want you to live your life. I want you to be
  happy. That's all I've ever wanted. I want you to try and grow up
  to be the kind of person that would've made your mom proud. Okay?
Kim: [sobbing] Oh, God.
Jack Bauer: Promise me that.
Kim: I promise.

Jack Bauer: Honey, I've got to start focusing on what I'm doing up
  here, I'm running out of time, okay? So uh... I-I'm gonna have to
  say good-bye. I love you more than anything in the world and I'll
  always be with you, okay? Remember that.
Kim: Oh. I'm proud of you, and I love you.
Jack Bauer: I love you too sweetheart... Bye.

Nina Myers: He is gonna put a bullet in my head before I can say
  hello, and then he'll turn the gun on himself.
Jack Bauer: We'll make sure he doesn't turn the gun on himself.

Jack Bauer: I like working with you, Chase; you're a nice kid. But
  don't you ever come into my office and talk to me like that again,
  do you understand me?

Chase: Listen, Jack. I'm gonna be honest with you. I look up to you.
  I'd take a bullet for you if I had to, but right now, I'm gonna
  hold the mirror up. You were under with Salazar for six months. I
  know what they did to you, and I know what you did to yourself. You
  can't make that go away overnight. You think I didn't know?
Jack Bauer: You should mind your own business, Chase.
Chase: All I'm trying to say is that I'm here for you. But today is
  not the day to try to prove to everybody that you're all better.
  It's about to hit the fan, you know that and I know that. So do
  what you gotta do, man. Get your head straight, so we can do our
  work.

[Jack hits a button on his watch. Meanwhile, back at CTU, Gael's Palm
  Pilot starts to beep]
Gael Ortega: He's in.
Ryan Chappelle: What are you talking about? Who's in?
Tony Almeida: Jack.
Ryan Chappelle: What?
Tony Almeida: Gael and I have been working with Jack. We've been
  trying to get him back undercover with the Salazars. That signal
  mean he's back in.
Ryan Chappelle: I don't understand.
Tony Almeida: Look, I'll explain everything. Right now we've gotta
  call the president.

Jack Bauer: A few years ago, my wife was killed because of my job. My
  daughter has never been the same since. This last year... well, you
  know what I went through to bring you in. What'd I get for it? A
  pat on the back. In the end, a demotion and a heroin habit. I'm
  tired of putting my ass on the line for nothing. I'm DONE putting
  my ass on the line for nothing.

Ramon Salazar: [about Jack Bauer] That man has more lives than a cat.

Jack Bauer: You don't have any more information, do you, Nina?
Nina Myers: Yes I do.
Jack Bauer: No, you don't. [shoots her]

[Chloe has just broken the news to Kim that Chase has a baby]
Chase: How'd she take the news?
Chloe: Gosh, Chase, I think she was kind of pissed!

Sherry Palmer: Complex problems sometimes have the simplest
  solutions.

Michael Amador: You betrayed me, Jack, you were CTU all along.
Jack Bauer: That's right, Amador. You betrayed me, too, I'm just
  better at it than you.

[Chase is trying to convince Chapelle that Jack should lead the
  strike team on the field after getting a lead on Amador]
Chapelle: I didn't ask for your opinion.
Chase: Well I just gave it to you.

Michael Amador: Can you protect my family?
Jack Bauer: Yes, we can.
Michael Amador: How can you protect my family when you can't even
  protect yours?

Sherry Palmer: What? What's Funny?
President Palmer: No, nothing really. It's just that, when I wanted
  you to pull back, just let things be, you were a shark. Now that
  I've asked you back. I need you to be a shark.
Sherry Palmer: I can still be, whatever you need me to be.

President Palmer: Jack, you saved my life. I trust you as much as I
  trust anybody.

Sherry Palmer: Who are you calling?
Jack Bauer: CTU. I am a sworn federal agent, Mrs. Palmer. You just
  confessed to a federal crime.

President Palmer: Make no mistake: if we unleash our military power
  on nations that later prove innocent, it will rank as one of the
  most despicable sneak attacks in history. Any chance for peace in
  the Middle East will vanish forever. Even if it'll cost American
  lives in the future, we must delay this attack until we are certain
  of our ground.

President Palmer: Mike, I want to thank you for calling CTU in the
  eleventh hour.
Mike Novick: Of course, Mr. President.
President Palmer: [leans in close] But you should have been with me
  to the end. That's what I expected of you, that's why I appointed
  you! I'm relieving you of your post, effective immediately.
Mike Novick: [starts crying] Yes, Mr. President.

Jack Bauer: George, as crazy as this may sound, you're going to have
  to trust me.

Nina Myers: I only get the pardon if I stop the bomb. Why wouldn't I
  do everything I can.
Jack Bauer: Because you're worse than a traitor, Nina. You don't even
  have a cause, you don't believe in anything. But you would sell
  anyone and everything out to the highest bidder. So [throws table]
  [shouts] stop wasting my time. Gimme a name!

[just before shooting Ryan Chappelle]
Jack Bauer: God, forgive me.

Tony Almeida: Chloe, I'm getting real tired of your personality.

Stephen Saunders: I like to do things in phases. You should know that
  by now.

Jack Bauer: [to Saunders about putting his daughter in the hotel
  where the virus had been released] When your daughter is infected,
  I'm going to make you watch her die.

Jack Bauer: Stephen, you're out of time!

Jack Bauer: I used to be in the military. Used to do field work for
  the CIA. I've been to some horrible places. I've seen some pretty
  terrible things. I don't think I've ever been this scared in my
  whole life.

Sherry Palmer: You finish the speech?
President Palmer: Taking a break. The guys got tired of me yelling at
  them.

[to Syed Ali]
Jack Bauer: I know you think what you're doing is right. But it is my
  job not to let that happen.

[his last lines]
George Mason: It's time.

[about Syed Ali]
Jack Bauer: Are you trying to protect this man?
Imam Fulani: No, Agent Bauer, I have no misplaced loyalties. If the
  man you are looking for has murdered an innocent, he is as guilty
  in the eyes of Islam as he is in yours.
Jack Bauer: The man that I'm looking for set in motion a plan today
  to detonate a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.
Imam Fulani: Are you certain?
Jack Bauer: Yes, we're certain. Our estimates are between one and two
  million people will die if this bomb goes off. That, sir, is why we
  need to find him now.

Christopher Henderson: I'm doing this to protect the integrity of the
  government.
Jack Bauer: The government has no integrity!

[to his son, Behrooz]
Navi Araz: What we accomplish today will change the world. We are
  fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this.

James Heller: Spare me your sixth grade Michael Moore logic!

[realizing that CTU has been compromised, Jack makes a special phone
  call]
Audrey Heller Raines: Who are calling?
Jack Bauer: The only person I can trust right now.

Ramon Salazar: What did you learn from Edmunds?
Hector Salazar: He can take a bullet through the hand without saying
  anything useful.

Henry Powell: Who are you guys? Police? FBI?
Tony Almeida: Actually, I'm currently unemployed.

[Jane Saunders is unwilling to help Jack find her father]
Jack Bauer: You have no idea how far I'm willing to go to acquire
  your cooperation.

[Dina has just learned that Behrooz has been taken hostage by Navi]
Dina Araz: If you cannot save my son, then I am happy to see the
  reactors melt down.
Jack Bauer: [to Erin Driscoll, while on phone] Did you get that?

Dina Araz: [Dina is moving Debbie's dead body while Behrooz watches
  in shock]
Dina Araz: For God's sake, pull yourself together!
Behrooz Araz: She didn't know anything. You didn't have to kill her.
Dina Araz: Yes, I did. Because you didn't have the courage to kill
  her yourself.
Behrooz Araz: Courage? To poison a girl who did no harm to you at
  all?
Dina Araz: [Dina and Behrooz stop, as they hear a car door close.
  Dina checks the blinds] Your father's home!
Behrooz Araz: [Behrooz watches as Dina grabs a pillow and the gun]
  What are you doing? She's already dead.
Dina Araz: If your father doesn't see a bullet wound, he'll ask
  questions. Do you want him to know that you tried to help your
  girlfriend escape? Do you want him to know that you failed him
  again? Move away! [Dina fires the gun into the pillow, and leaves a
  bullet in Debbie, and offers Behrooz the gun] Take it. Take it.
  Behrooz, take it. Take it! This has to stop, Behrooz. You are my
  son and I love you, but I cannot let you destroy everything.
  Everything we worked so hard to achieve.

Edgar Stiles: [as he speaks to Marianne Taylor, who is bossing him
  around] Just because you overheard that conversation between Chloe
  and me doesn't mean I'm your bitch.

Tony Almeida: Some people feel more comfortable in hell.

President Palmer: All right. This is what we're gonna do. We may be
  short on manpower, but it doesn't have to appear that way. Send all
  the Eastern Georgia National Guard to Marietta, and tell the media
  that this is where something's going to happen.
Mike Novick: Uh, what's going to happen, sir?
President Palmer: If this is what the people are going to be
  watching, let's show them how we're going to respond. I want them
  to see how we protect our citizens. We will not put up with racism
  or xenophobia. If this is where it's going to start, this is where
  it's going to stop.

[Chappelle catches Tony taking a briefcase out of a cabinet]
Tony Almeida: They're suicide capsules. For the people at the hotel.
  It's going to get pretty bad down there.
Ryan Chappelle: That's against every regulation in the book.
Tony Almeida: Yeah.
[pause]
Ryan Chappelle: Do it.

Kalil Hasan: I think someone is anxious that I get to where I'm
  going.
Omar: What makes you think that?
Kalil Hasan: I just got stopped by two cops who let me go in very
  little time.
Omar: And?
Kalil Hasan: This is a stolen car.
Omar: Maybe the driver has not reported it yet?
Kalil Hasan: A cop was approaching me with his hand on his gun. He
  gets a call: suddenly there's no problem.
[Omar grimaces as he realises Kalil is right]

President Palmer: Now, Jack, if it were anyone else, I would ask you
  if you were sure. But with you, I already know the answer. God
  bless you, and good luck.

President Palmer: [Explaining to President Logan, whom he is
  advising, why he authorized a covert operation that could be
  construed as an act of war; Logan disagrees] We didn't bring this
  crisis on ourselves, but we'll be the ones to settle it. This is a
  dirty business and we have to get our hands dirty to clean it up!

Gary: You're telling me one of us has to get caught so the other can
  escape?
Mandy: Yes. It's going to be you. [shoots him]

Sherry Palmer: Mike's job is to tell you what you want to hear. Mine
  is to tell you the truth
President Palmer: You're not qualified for that job.

Mandy: [after CTU realizes she is still alive] Looks like my
  neighbors died for nothing.

Michelle Dessler: I'll go anywhere with you... as long as I don't
  have to cook.
Tony Almeida: [laughing] Sweetheart, if you promise not to cook I
  will take you with me anywhere.

Jack Bauer: [while holding a gun at Sherek, locked in the
  interrogation room, Jack turns a table over] You are gonna tell me.
  [shouts] What is happening at eight o'clock?
Erin Driscoll: [over audio] Holster your weapon! Jack! I said holster
  your weapon!
Erin Driscoll: [Jack shoots Sherek in the kneecap as Sherek screams
  out in pain. Erin watches, gasping, turns to Sarah] Call Medical.
Jack Bauer: [Jack starts to move around Sherek, as he still trains
  his gun on him] What is your primary objective?
Erin Driscoll: I'll order Security to shoot you if I have to!
Ronnie Lobell: [to security agents] Get that door open!
Jack Bauer: [Jack's gun is now pointed at Sherek's other knee cap]
  *What* is your primary objective?
Thomas Sherek: [Sherek is still trying to resist, but can't]
  Secretary of Defense!
Erin Driscoll: [softly] Heller.
Jack Bauer: Secretary Heller?
Thomas Sherek: [in pain] Yes.
Jack Bauer: Secretary Heller's the target, call Secret Service now!

Jack Bauer: [to his new girlfriend Diane] My name's not Frank. It's
  Jack Bauer.

Lynn McGill: But I'm not about to start considering disobeying a
  direct order from the White House!
Bill Buchanan: That's because you don't have the experience to know
  any better.

Tony Almeida: She's gone, Jack...

Martha Logan: It has been a very long day... we could all use a
  rest...

Vladimir Bierko: Release the Syntox here and two hundred thousand
  people will die.

[Jack is taken hostage by Victor Drazen]
Tony Almeida: How did Jack sound? [on the phone]
George Mason: Alive.

[at the very start of each show except Season 1 and other Season
  Premieres]
Jack Bauer: Previously on 24.

[at the main start of each show]
Jack Bauer: The following takes place between...

[at the start of each Season Premiere]
Jack Bauer: Events occur in real time.

Renee Walker: I know how to get that Bracelet off...


# "24" (2001) {10:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m. (#1.11)}
Jack Bauer: You're a good liar. But I've seen better.

Andre Drazen: When Plan A fails, you should have a Plan B, not Plan A
  recycled.

Second Grader: Is it true you played basketball?
Senator David Palmer: Sure did. Georgetown.
Second Grader: My daddy says Georgetown sucks.
Senator David Palmer: I think I need to have a little talk with your
  daddy.
Second Grader: He also says there will never be a black president in
  this country, ever.
Senator David Palmer: Would you give your daddy a message for me?
  Tell him I understand where he's coming from, but he's wrong. And
  I'm gonna prove it.

Jack Bauer: You probably don't think that I can force this towel down
  your throat. But trust me, I can. All the way. Except I'd hold onto
  this one little bit at the end. When your stomach starts to digest
  it, I pull it out. Taking your stomach lining with it. For most
  people it would take about a week to die. It's very painful.


# "24" (2001) {10:00 p.m.-11:00 p.m. (#1.23)}
[Jack wants David Palmer to fake his own death]
Sherry Palmer: You've got to be kidding.
Jack Bauer: I've never been more serious in my life.

Kim: My father is a good man.
Andre Drazen: No, he's not.


# "24" (2001) {11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. (#1.12)}
Jack Bauer: [to Kevin Carroll] If anything goes wrong, everyone
  around the car dies-starting with you.

Ira Gaines: [Rick is about to drive away in a van] What are you
  doing?
Rick: Taking the van.
Ira Gaines: I can see that Rick. Where are you taking the van?


# "24" (2001) {11:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m. (#1.24)}
Andre Drazen: What if Bauer doesn't come? He may be too crushed by
  the thought of his daughter's death.
Victor Drazen: That is exactly why he will come. Believe me, I know.

Nina Myers: [about Jack] You'll have to kill him, no mistakes. If he
  finds out I lied to him, my cover will be blown.
Victor Drazen: Of course we will kill him, that is the point.

Nina Myers: Jack, if you kill me, you won't know who I work for. You
  think I work for Drazen, but I don't.
Jack Bauer: I trusted you, Nina.
Nina Myers: I was just doing my job.
Jack Bauer: Your job? My wife and daughter almost died today. How
  many people that trusted you because you were doing your job?
  Walsh, Jamey, Ellis? How many others?

[last lines]
Jack Bauer: I'm so sorry.

Jack Bauer: [On cell phone] George, it's me.
George Mason: Jack! Well, as usual, I don't know whether to
  congratulate you or to demand for your resignation.


# "24" (2001) {12:00 a.m.-1:00 a.m. (#1.1)}
Nina Myers: You're lying.
Jack Bauer: Yes I am. But you're still going to have to trust me.

Jack Bauer: [to George Mason] Why don't you explain it to me. You've
  got five seconds. [prepares to press *enter* button on laptop]

George Mason: You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
Jack Bauer: Why don't you explain it to me. You've got five seconds.
Jack Bauer: [prepares to press *enter* button on laptop]

Kimberly Bauer: So, is she still giving you the cold shoulder?
Jack Bauer: If by "she" you're referring to your mother, I'd
  appreciate if you called her by her name. Mom. And no, she's just
  busy.
Kimberly Bauer: She's busy a lot.

Jamey Farrell: How long is this going to take?
Nina Myers: Why, are we interrupting your social life?
Jamey Farrell: At least I have one.
Nina Myers: Funny.

[Phone conversation]
Vincent: Hello?
Jack Bauer: Vincent, Jack Bauer. You planning on seeing Kimberly
  tonight?
Vincent: No way, man. We broke up, you know that.
Jack Bauer: I just wanted to make sure you knew that.
Vincent: Chill, man. I don't know where she is. You've got my word.
Jack Bauer: That's a real comfort, Vincent, knowing I've got your
  word.

Jack Bauer: You can look the other way once, and it's no big deal,
  except it makes it easier for you to compromise the next time, and
  pretty soon that's all your doing; compromising, because that's the
  way you think things are done. You know those guys I busted? You
  think they were the bad guys? Because they weren't, they weren't
  bad guys, they were just like you and me. Except they
  compromised... Once.

Jack Bauer: My name is Jack Bauer, and this is the longest day of my
  life.

Senator David Palmer: All right, "On this historic occasion..."
Patty Brooks: Well, it is an historic occasion, sir.

Jack Bauer: I was thinking we should try to remember what it was like
  when we were kids.
Teri Bauer: It's a different world now, Jack.
Jack Bauer: Yeah, I know.

Jack Bauer: Tony. I need detailed background on everyone on Senator
  Palmer's staff now.
Tony Almeida: Why?
Jack Bauer: Because I think this is about him and I want us to be
  prepared.
Tony Almeida: If it leaks out that we're screening Senator Palmer,
  people might think it's because he's black.
Jack Bauer: Well, it is because he's black. It makes him the most
  likely target.

Richard Walsh: We have reason to believe that by the end of the day
  an attempt will be made on David Palmer's life.

Richard Walsh: How are you doing?
Jack Bauer: I can't complain.
Richard Walsh: Can't or won't?

Jack Bauer: George. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to call
  your boss so I can get clearance on the identification of the
  source.
George Mason: I thought we just agreed that it didn't matter.
Jack Bauer: Yeah, but I still have to call Walsh and tell him I did
  everything I could. I would like to cover my own ass.
George Mason: Jack, you're finally learning how to play the game.

Nina Myers: Tony, I need you to do something for me.
Tony Almeida: For you or for Jack.

Richard Walsh: If Palmer gets hit, the first African-American with a
  real shot at the White House, they'll tear this country apart.


# "24" (2001) {12:00 p.m.-1:00 p.m. (#1.13)}
Jack Bauer: Part of getting a second chance is taking responsibility
  for the mess you made in the first place.

Jack Bauer: [over a walkie-talkie] You're losing blood.
Ira Gaines: Not enough to stop me from killing you.
Jack Bauer: Maybe neither of us has to die.
Ira Gaines: Like I said, Jack, I don't have that choice.
Jack Bauer: Well, maybe at least you can tell me what's going on.
[Gaines is silent as he looks for Jack]
Jack Bauer: Cofell. He mentioned something about Belgrade. That was a
  military operation, how's Palmer connected to that?
Ira Gaines: You were there, Jack, you should know.
Jack Bauer: Let's say I don't.
Ira Gaines: [after a long pause] Neither do I. The less I know, the
  better I can do my job, that's just the nature of our business.
Jack Bauer: Then why did you bring my family into this?
Ira Gaines: That might've been a mistake. They wanted to make it
  personal.
Jack Bauer: [no longer on the walkie-talkie] Who's they?
[Gaines realizes Jack is behind him]
Jack Bauer: Put down the weapon, Mr. Gaines. We can protect you.
Ira Gaines: No, you can't.
[Gaines gets up]
Jack Bauer: Put down the weapon!
[There's a short pause]
Ira Gaines: [his last lines] Good luck.
[Gaines turns around, weapon in hand. Jack drops to the ground and
  shoots him in the chest. Gaines falls to the ground dead]


# "24" (2001) {1:00 p.m.-2:00 p.m. (#1.14)}
Milo Pressman: What do you think they're going to do to Jack?
Tony Almeida: Not going to name a street after him, that's for sure.

Mike Novick: That was the Pentagon. Remember you asked me to look up
  the name Jack Bauer?
Senator David Palmer: Who is he?
[Mike leans over, and whispers to Palmer]
Mike Novick: He used to be in Special Forces. He led a six man team
  into Kosovo a couple of years ago.
Senator David Palmer: That's what it was. The Drazen mission.
Mike Novick: Bauer picked his own men and trained them. Only Bauer
  survived.
Senator David Palmer: He blames me for the death of his men.

Kevin Carroll: [Calls Andre on his cellphone] Mr. Drazen?
Andre Drazen: [Picks up] Yes.
Kevin Carroll: We just got to the transfer point.
Andre Drazen: What about Gaines?
Kevin Carroll: He's dead.
Andre Drazen: I see.
Kevin Carroll: Listen, ah, Mr. Drazen. When Gaines hired me for this
  I told him there were a couple defects in his plan that could be
  exploited. Not to say I told you so, but I'm not surprised any of
  this happened the way it did.
Andre Drazen: Is there a point to any of this?
Kevin Carroll: Yes. I can fix it for you.
Andre Drazen: Interesting. And how can you do that?
Kevin Carroll: I've done this before. I know people. When I was
  working for the DEA in Florida, I was able to get to a witness that
  no one could find. 12 hours later, he was dead. Problem solved, if
  you get what I'm saying.
Andre Drazen: I appreciate the offer Kevin, but as you Americans so
  often say, Plan B is already in effect. [Hangs up phone]
Kevin Carroll: What does that mean? [Yelling] Drazen!


# "24" (2001) {2:00 a.m.-3:00 a.m. (#1.3)}
Ira Gaines: [Mandy's girlfriend has just been shot] The job is on
  summer. Are you in?
Mandy: [suppressing emotion] Yes.

Tony Almeida: You mind telling me what's going on around here
  tonight?
Jack Bauer: What's going on? You mean besides a 747 falling out of
  the sky and a threat on a presidential candidate's life?
Tony Almeida: Yeah, besides that.

Tony Almeida: This is Almeida at C.T.U. Look, you better get down
  here fast. Jack Bauer needs to be relieved of his command.


# "24" (2001) {2:00 p.m.-3:00 p.m. (#1.15)}
President Palmer: I can't wait for Ellis to get back to us. I've got
  to go.
Jack Bauer: Senator, they're not going to let me continue to work
  here. I am technically still under arrest.
[pause]
President Palmer: Come on.
[They exit the conference room, and enter the main CTU floor]
President Palmer: Ryan!
Ryan Chappelle: Yes, Senator?
President Palmer: I understand you have Jack under arrest.
Jack Bauer: I told the Senator I was being detained for questioning.
President Palmer: There is an ongoing crisis that supersedes any
  charges that might be filed against him.
Ryan Chappelle: But Senator...
President Palmer: I want him reinstated to his previous position,
  effective immediately.
Alberta Green: I'm sorry, sir, but you don't have the authority to
  make that decision.
Ryan Chappelle: Alberta, please.
[Alberta stares at Palmer, then backs off]
Ryan Chappelle: Sir, what you are asking isn't possible. The charges
  against Agent Bauer are serious. We would be held in contempt of
  agency regulations if we reinstated him without a hearing.
Jack Bauer: Ryan, you don't have to reinstate me. Not permanantly.
  Look, nobody here has as much information about this situation as I
  do. Give me provisional status, just till the end of the day. Then
  you can take me back into custody, do whatever you want.
[pause; Chappelle looks at Palmer]
Ryan Chappelle: Fine, Jack. You work the case out of CTU, but you
  answer to me. Good luck with your campaign, Senator.
[Chappelle walks off]
Jack Bauer: Thank you.
[Jack stares at Green. Palmer then pulls Jack aside]

Nina Myers: Look, I realize this is a terrible time for you to
  discover all this.
Teri Bauer: When do you think a good time would be, Nina?

President Palmer: I know why you want me dead, Mr. Bauer.
Jack Bauer: Want you dead, Senator? I don't know what you're talking
  about.
President Palmer: Kosovo!
Jack Bauer: Kosovo?
President Palmer: I know you hold me responsible for the men you lost
  there. Two years ago today.
Jack Bauer: You know about Operation Nightfall?
President Palmer: I authorized the mission. I know you took out
  Victor Drazen and his inner circle, and I know you lost six men in
  the process.
Jack Bauer: And you think I want revenge for the death of men?
President Palmer: Yes, I do.
Jack Bauer: With all due respect, Senator, I almost died today trying
  to protect you! And if I blame anyone for the death of my men in
  Kosovo, sir, I blame myself!

Jack Bauer: The reason why I went for that Secret Service agent's
  gun, sir, was to try and get you out of the room without giving
  myself away. The people that want you dead, they had kidnapped my
  family. They threatened to kill them if I didn't assist them in the
  assassination attempt.

[after receiving a call from Palmer]
Robert Ellis: What are you doing in the same room with Bauer? I went
  to a lot of trouble to make sure you two never met each other.

Robert Ellis: I'm the only one who even knows that you both were
  involved in Nightfall.

Ryan Chappelle: Senator Palmer. Ryan Chappelle.
[Chappelle and Palmer shake hands]
President Palmer: What seems to be the problem, Ryan? Why can't I get
  in to see Agent Bauer?
Ryan Chappelle: Please forgive the wait. But when an agent is under
  internal investigation, procedure is to keep him isolated until
  he's been fully interrogated.


# "24" (2001) {3:00 a.m.-4:00 a.m. (#1.4)}
Ira Gaines: Be good and you'll be back at the mall in a day or two,
  be bad and you won't.

Cop: Maybe you didn't notice, but that guy just shot a cop.
Jack Bauer: I'm aware of that, but there's something else at stake
  here.
Cop: Not to me. Not to these guys.

[chasing a suspect]
Jack Bauer: I wish you hadn't called for backup.
Jessie Hampton: Why?
Jack Bauer: Because cops have to play by the rules. I may have to
  break a few with this guy.

President Palmer: Jack, what about Ellis? Was he able to retrieve the
  missing file on Operation Nightfall?
Jack Bauer: I lost contact with Ellis.
President Palmer: "Lost contact"? What do you mean?
Jack Bauer: I mean we got interrupted in the middle of our phone
  call. Sir, I have to be honest with you. I've got a very bad
  feeling about this.
President Palmer: So what are you telling me?
Jack Bauer: I'm telling you that for now, we should assume Ellis is
  dead.
President Palmer: Keep me posted.
Jack Bauer: Yes, sir.

Police Officer: Freeze!
Jack Bauer: Federal agent!
Police Officer: Your badge! Nice and slowly.
Jack Bauer: I'm putting my gun down. [puts his gun down, takes out
  his I.D. and throws it towards the police officer]
Police Officer: [looking at the I.D] CTU? What the hell is that?
Jack Bauer: Counter Terrorist Unit.


# "24" (2001) {4:00 a.m.-5:00 a.m. (#1.5)}
Dan: We'd like our money now. If that's like, you know, okay.
Ira Gaines: Well, just so we're like, you know, clear, what happened
  to the other girl?
Dan: Janet? Like I told you, we had to kill her.
Ira Gaines: My people tell me that a girl fitting her description was
  taken to a hospital near to where you were. How do you explain
  that?
Dan: Well, the thing is that
[pause]
Dan: Maybe she wasn't quite dead.
Ira Gaines: Well, I'll tell ya, Dan. You're either dead or you're not
  dead. There's no such thing as "sorta dead". Here, let me show you.
[pulls out gun and shoots Dan]
Ira Gaines: [to a very shocked Rick] Congratulations, you've just
  been promoted

Greg Penticoff: If you ever want to see your daughter again, get me
  out of this.

Nina Myers: Okay, there's a payphone down the block and it's in
  service. What about a warrant?
Jack Bauer: Forget the warrant.

Greg Penticoff: No more questions without my lawyer.
Jack Bauer: [Ignoring him] Who are you working for?
Greg Penticoff: Are you deaf? I said no questions without my lawyer.
Jack Bauer: [Snickers] Your lawyer can kiss my ass.


# "24" (2001) {4:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m. (#1.17)}
Alexis Drazen: I must say, I do find it a little strange that the
  Senator wouldn't include someone as smart and capable as you in his
  inner circle.
Elizabeth Nash: How would you know how smart I am? We've spent, what,
  maybe 15 hours together, and most of it has been in bed?
Nina Myers: [listening on the monitor] That wasn't smart.
Alexis Drazen: Was that a complaint or a compliment?


# "24" (2001) {5:00 a.m.-6:00 a.m. (#1.6)}
Ira Gaines: Now tuck that in your ear and say something.
Jack Bauer: If you hurt my daughter I will kill you.
Ira Gaines: Good. That was a nice clear signal.

Ira Gaines: Bury your friend.
Rick: Where?
Ira Gaines: [annoyed] In the ground.

Ira Gaines: Say something.
Jack Bauer: If you hurt my daughter I WILL kill you.
Ira Gaines: Good. That's a nice, clear signal.

Ira Gaines: That's right, we're watching you.


# "24" (2001) {6:00 a.m.-7:00 a.m. (#1.7)}
Jack Bauer: [steaming] If Alan York's dead, then who is the man with
  my wife.
Ira Gaines: [smug] He's not an accountant from the valley, that's for
  sure.
Jack Bauer: I swear to God if you hurt my wife or my daughter, I will
  kill you you son of a bitch!
Ira Gaines: [fires a gun into the air]
Jack Bauer: [panicked] Oh my God! What have you done?!? What have you
  done?!??!??!??
Ira Gaines: Everything's fine Jack, but unless you start doing as you
  are told, that will be the last sound your wife and daughter will
  hear.
Jack Bauer: I'll do as your told.
Ira Gaines: Good. That's the spirit.

Jack Bauer: If Alan York is dead, who is the man with my wife?
Ira Gaines: He's not an accountant from the valley, that's for sure.

Jack Bauer: Mason...
George Mason: [surveys damage around the outside cafe where Jack was]
  Nice, Jack. Does it seem to you that no matter where you go,
  there's always a body count?


# "24" (2001) {6:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m. (#1.19)}
George Mason: Have you noticed, wherever you go there's a body count?


# "24" (2001) {7:00 p.m.-8:00 p.m. (#1.20)}
Andre Drazen: [Andre plans his next move with his men] From the
  machine room we'll go through the fire wall in section A4.
Karris: That's two inches of reinforced steel.
Andre Drazen: We can take it out with a shaped charge. Concussion
  will disorient the men posted there long enough for us to take them
  out. [to Karris] If you have a problem, Karris, share it with the
  rest of us.
Karris: It took us a year to organize this operation, and now it's
  all coming apart. First, your brother disappears before he can cut
  the power, then we find out we're up against twice as many men as
  you said there will be.
Andre Drazen: We can still achieve what we came here to do.
Karris: I'm not against going in, Andre. As long as we take the time
  to do it right.
Andre Drazen: You don't think this is the right way?
Karris: I'd say the odds pretty much suck.
Andre Drazen: How much worse would you calculate they've become?
Karris: I don't know.
Andre Drazen: Give me a number. 10%? 20%?
Karris: I'd say fifty.
Andre Drazen: Then I'll adjust your compensation accordingly.
Karris: It's not about the money.
Andre Drazen: You accepted an advance, signed a contract.
Karris: Which you broke first, Andre.
Andre Drazen: [Andre grabs Karris and threatens him with a knife] The
  next word that I hear from you that isn't constructive - I release
  you from your contract.

Andre Drazen: [Andre makes a backup plan] We still need to cut the
  power.
Karris: But your brother hasn't contacted us yet.
Andre Drazen: He would've called by now... if he were alive. We
  should assume Alexis is dead. There may be another way, though. The
  substation for this sector is a half-mile from here. A few ounces
  of C-5 should be sufficient. To save time, we'll go in through the
  front.
Karris: The idea is not to attract attention.
Andre Drazen: The idea is to get my father out of prison. This is the
  best chance we'll ever have.

Mark DeSalvo: [DeSalvo's cell phone rings. Jack looks on impatiently]
  Yeah, he's right here. I understand.
Jack Bauer: We got permission to move Drazen?
Mark DeSalvo: No. That request is still making it's way up the chain
  of command, but DOD says you can interrogate him if you want.
Jack Bauer: Good. [Jack prepares to walk to Victor's holding cell]
Mark DeSalvo: Bauer. [Jack turns around] Five minutes.
Jack Bauer: Fine.
Jack Bauer: [Jack goes into the holding room. DeSalvo watches Jack's
  interrogation on the moniters] My name is Jack Bauer. You'll have
  to pardon my surprise. I saw you die. I watched you enter a
  building. Nobody could have survived that explosion. Our
  intelligence told us the building was empty when you entered.
  [Victor sits, stone faced] Your fight is with me. Not my wife, not
  my daughter, but with me. Please... leave my family alone. Mr.
  Drazen, you have already lost your wife and your daughter. You
  don't need to lose your sons too.
Victor Drazen: My sons are soldiers.
Jack Bauer: Then they will die for nothing! We know about the rescue
  plan. It was scheduled for 7:20. We stopped it. We've called in for
  backup. If they try again, sir, they will die.
Victor Drazen: Then you have nothing to worry about. [Smiles]
Jack Bauer: Call it off, Victor.
Victor Drazen: How can I?...
Jack Bauer: The same way you've been communicating with them this
  entire time! Call it off or your sons will die!

Victor Drazen: They're here.

  in over 24 hours. So maybe you should be a little more afraid of me
  than you are now.

Jack Bauer: What's your name? Lauren? I'm Jack. I work for a special
  branch of the government. Last night, I was given a very important
  assignment. Right now, someone is trying to stop me from doing it.

Jack Bauer: I used to be in the military. Used to do field work for
  the CIA. I've been to some horrible places. I've seen some pretty
  terrible things. I don't think I've ever been this scared in my
  whole life.

Vice President Jim Prescott: If military strikes do not occur
  imminently casualties to American soldiers will increase by tens of
  thousands of lives. That analysis is undisputed.
President Palmer: The risk of attacking innocent countries is
  unacceptable. We have to be sure.
Vice President Jim Prescott: Everybody is sure, Mr. President.
  Everybody but you.
President Palmer: Well, as it happens, I'm the only one who counts.

President Palmer: Listen to me. All of you. I know you're not in the
  same room with me but you can see and hear me plainly enough. Take
  a good look. Do I seem scared? Am I breaking into a nervous sweat?
  Am I babbling? At a loss for words? Is my voice shaking? Can any
  one of you look me in the eye and tell me I'm disabled?

President Palmer: Mr. Prescott, there seems to be a collective
  feeling that a discussion is called for. In the interest in putting
  this behind us, I'll agree on one condition. When it's over, if I'm
  supported you tender your resignation as vice president of this
  country.
Vice President Jim Prescott: Very well, Mr. President.
Secretary of State: I, uh, suggest we all take a few minutes to
  compose ourselves and, uh, then get on with the proceeding.

Nina Myers: [reaching slowly for a gun and speaking in a raspy voice]
  I do.
Jack Bauer: No, you don't.
[shoots her three times, killing her]

Tony Almeida: [Asking about Marcus Alvers] All we've been able to dig
  up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known
  aliases. He had an MRI on one of his knees, there's a prescription
  for antibiotics, treated for HIV ...
Dalton Furrelle: [From other room] Her pulse is spiking. Someone
  hasn't been using protection with Marcus Alvers.
Michelle Dessler: [From other room] She's probably had sex with him.
Tony Almeida: See, Nina, my colleagues in the next room tell me that
  something in those medical records concerns you. I'm guessing it's
  not the knee.

Tony Almeida: [During torture] How much more of this do you wanna
  endure, Nina?
Nina Myers: I think this is about it. [Nina jerks her head backward,

  Air Force One has sustained an indirect hit from an air-to-air

Audrey Heller Raines: [Jack bursts into the operating room of Paul
  Raines with an injured Lee Jong. Audrey looks on] Jack, what's
  going on? Jack.
Dr. Marc Besson: You can't come in here.
Jack Bauer: He's dying!
Dr. Marc Besson: So is he. Get out of here, I just started this
  operation.
Jack Bauer: This man is our only connection to a stolen nuclear
  warhead. You gotta save him now!
Dr. Marc Besson: I'll get to him as soon as I can.
Jack Bauer: He's not gonna make it.
Dr. Marc Besson: I already have a patient.
Jack Bauer: [Jack motions Curtis to set up the gurney] Curtis.
Jack Bauer: [Jack pulls his gun on Besson] You have a new one.
Dr. Marc Besson: Are you crazy?
Jack Bauer: Maybe you didn't understand me. This is the only man that
  can help us find the missing warhead and stop it from being
  detonated. If you don't save him, millions of people will die, do
  you understand that? Millions of people. Start working on him now!
Audrey Heller Raines: Jack, what are you doing?
Dr. Marc Besson: If I walk away from Mr. Raines now, he will die.
Jack Bauer: You don't know that for sure.
Audrey Heller Raines: Jack!
Jack Bauer: [Ignoring her] Do it. Now!

Chloe O'Brian: Edgar, I appreciate your concern. I really do. It's
  just that when I shot that guy I thought I'd go all fetal position,
  but the truth is I didn't feel anything, at all. I hope I'm not
  some kind of a psychopath.

Tony Almeida: Let's try to open up a negotiation.
Dina Araz: My husband won't negotiate.
Tony Almeida: Why is that?
Dina Araz: He doesn't need to. He has to assume I have agreed to help
  you in return for my son's safety.
Tony Almeida: Well, he can't stay down there with him forever.
Dina Araz: He won't. In two hours, all the reactors will have gone
  critical. After that, it won't matter what I tell you, and he can
  kill my son. I am only helping you to save his life. I believe in
  our cause, and if you can't save my son, I am happy to see the

  override. He's right here. Wanna say "hello"? [Powell's dead body
  is wheeled into the room]
Marianne Taylor: Are you sick? You sick bastard.
Curtis Manning: CTU didn't kill him.
Marianne Taylor: Well, then who did?
Curtis Manning: The same people who planted the bomb under your car.
  Whoever they are, they've caught up to you. If I let you go, you'd
  be dead in 15 minutes.
Curtis Manning: [Powell's body is wheeled out of the room] Your only

Tony Almeida: I'm sorry, who?
James Heller: Michelle Dessler, do you know her?
Tony Almeida: I used to be married to her.

James Heller: Maybe you should go home.
Erin Driscoll: I'm afraid to. [she cries]
James Heller: [Long pause] When my wife Susan died, I didn't deal
  with it at all. Actually, I went to work the next day. I remember
  thinking to myself, "That's life. Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
  Get over it, get on with it". A few weeks later, I answered a call
  from an old friend of Susan's who did not know she had died.
  [pause] And when I heard myself saying "Susan has passed away",
  when I actually said those words, it hit me. All the pain I was
  trying to shut out just overwhelmed me. Erin, you can't keep it
  inside. You cry, you blame God. You blame yourself and then you cry
  some more. And all the while you let your friends help you. It's
  pretty simple. Very painful. And I am so, so sorry for you.

  can't afford for you to be losing focus at a time like this, all
  right?
Edgar Stiles: I'm sick of people talking to me like I don't know what
  I'm doing! Especially people who don't really work here!

Edgar Stiles: Chloe, what are you doing here?
Chloe O'Brian: Michelle thought you could use some help. Offload your
  tasklist to me at station twelve, I'll cover your overflow.
Edgar Stiles: I can handle my assignment!
Chloe O'Brian: Well, obviously, you can't, otherwise Michelle
  wouldn't have called me in.

Jack Bauer: Take my gun.
[Dina hesitates]
Jack Bauer: This has to look as convincing as possible, take my gun!
Dina Araz: You must know that I want to kill you.

Jack Bauer: Whatever you've planned next is going to fail. Just like
  everything else you've tried today.
Habib Marwan: Fail? Almost 40 dead in the train crash, many more near
  the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.
Jack Bauer: That wasn't really your plan, was it? We managed to stop
  the other 103 power plants from melting down. That's what America
  will remember, that we stopped you.
Habib Marwan: No. They'll remember the image of Secretary of Defense
  Heller, held hostage on your own soil, and it will burn in their
  psyches. This country will forever be afraid to let their leaders
  appear in public.
Jack Bauer: For all the hatred that you have for this country, you
  don't understand it very well. Whatever you throw at us, I promise
  you, that will never happen.

Chloe O'Brian: Edgar, what's the new password for the central server?
Edgar Stiles: I'll get you on.
Chloe O'Brian: No, don't get me on, just give me the password so I
  can access it whenever I want to.
Edgar Stiles: It's not your area anymore.
Chloe O'Brian: What are you talking about? You work for me.
Edgar Stiles: No, I *worked* for you. Worked, with an -ed at the end.
  Past tense.
Chloe O'Brian: Edgar, I have been reinstated. So quit being
  territorial, just give me the password!
Edgar Stiles: No!
[Chloe walks over to Curtis]
Chloe O'Brian: Curtis, could you please explain to Edgar that I've
  been rehired to resume my position as head of com?
Curtis Manning: Things have changed, Chloe. Edgar took over from you,
  you'll be working for him now.
Chloe O'Brian: You're kidding? Michelle called me in because things
  were falling apart here under Edgar. Now give me my command or I
  walk.
Curtis Manning: You have equal authority. Just on paper, it has to
  look like you work for him.
Chloe O'Brian: Well, I'm not gonna do that. It's a matter of
  principle.
Curtis Manning: You'll be bumped up to a term 4 analist. That's a 35
  % increase in salary, plus bonus.
Chloe O'Brian: Well, I should be getting that anyway, but that's not
  my point. Edgar works for me.
Curtis Manning: Not today, Chloe.

Chloe O'Brian: Meg found something in the hourly, she's gonna get it
  to you. I need you to look at it, I'm preparing for this briefing.
Edgar Stiles: Can't Meg do it?
Chloe O'Brian: No, it's the job of the lead Tactical, isn't that what
  you think you are?
Edgar Stiles: I don't need your sarcasm, okay? I'll take care of it.

  will not let you down.

  figure. We see that it's President Logan]
President Charles Logan: See that you don't.

[about his brother David]
Wayne Palmer: I still can't accept talking about him in the past
  tense. It just... I just can't believe he's gone.

Jack Bauer: There is a big difference between training to kill
  someone and actually having to do it.

[Chloe is standing just outside the bathroom door]
Miles: What were you doing?
Chloe: [Pausing, looking shocked] Are you kidding? If you want the
  details I'll make you a report!

Charles Logan: This whole thing was meant to make our country safer,
  stronger. To protect our interests.

[On the phone to Audrey]
Jack Bauer: We're talking about taking down the President of the
  United States.

Secretary of Defense James Heller: I know what you did, I know what
  you're doing, and I'm here to put an end to it.

Jack Bauer: [to Christopher Henderson, who is holding Audrey hostage]
  Why are you doing this? Why are you protecting Logan?
Christopher Henderson: I'm protecting something much more important
  than Charles Logan...
Jack Bauer: What?
Christopher Henderson: The integrity of our government!
Jack Bauer: Our government has no integrity!

Walt Cummings: I was hoping to spair you this but I'm afraid Jack
  Bauer is forcing my hand to this.
Walt Cummings: He's on his way here with Mike Novick
President Charles Logan: Bauer? Why?
Walt Cummings: He's going accuse me of helping the terrorists acquire
  the nerve gas.
President Charles Logan: That's ridiculous.
Walt Cummings: No Sir, it's... it's the truth.
President Charles Logan: What did you say?

Yellow Tie Man: [Over cell phone] We know you've altered the arming
  codes, Mr. Cummings.
Walt Cummings: We can negotiate something.
Yellow Tie Man: I don't negotiate with my enemies. I eliminate them.
  Your country is about to pay a very steep price for betraying us.

Martha Logan: [sarcastic] "Oh yes, we're worried about the

Charles Logan: Damn it, Martha! That's the most important part of
  this! This scandal would destroy the American people's faith in
  their government. It would destroy our credibility all over the
  world.

Jack Bauer: [Rossler has been injured] My name is Jack Bauer, and I'm
  with CTU. Twenty-five minutes ago, you contacted a man named Ivan
  Erwich. What did he want you to do for him?
Jacob Rossler: I want my lawyer.
Jack Bauer: You'll get your lawyer as soon as I get what I need. Mr.
  Erwich is in possession of 20 canisters of Sentox VX nerve gas,
  which he has threatened to deploy here in the United States.
Jacob Rossler: I guess you have a problem.
Jack Bauer: I'd say you have a problem. You've been conspiring with
  and aiding known terrorists, which means I get to hold you for as
  long as I want. Now we know Mr. Erwich can't deploy the canisters
  unless he reconfigured a trigger mechanism; is that what he wanted
  you to do? [Rossler is silent] Trust me, you don't wanna go down
  this path with me.
Jacob Rossler: [With clenched teeth] Go to hell.
Jack Bauer: [Jack hits him in the face] That's exactly where I'm
  gonna send you unless you start to cooperate. [pause] You like
  hurting girls? Curtis. [Curtis steps on Rossler's wound]

Ross: Absolutely.
Chloe: Sit down!
Ross: Cool! [Examining her laptop] Wow, nice piece. Never seen one of
  these before. What is that?
Chloe: [zaps him with a stun-gun, knocking him out] A CTU Series 4.

Bill Buchanan: You have no idea what you're dealing with you little
  ass kisser!

President Charles Logan: I don't see where any of this becomes your
  business, Mike.
Mike Novick: I'll tell you where, Mr. President. I'm your Chief of
  Staff - if there's something going on that I don't know about that
  involves national security, it is my business.
President Charles Logan: This isn't national security, Mike - it's

  is acceptable to me in the least. You are a traitor to your country
  and a disgrace to your office. And it's my duty to see that you are
  brought to justice for what you have done. Is there anything
  else... Charles?

Aaron Pierce: There is nothing that you have said or done that is
  acceptable to me in the least. You're a traitor to this country and
  a disgrace to your office, and it's my duty to see that you're
  brought to justice for what you've done. Is there anything else,
  Charles?

Russian henchman: We can't do much damage with one canister of nerve
  gas.
Vladimir Bierko: You're so wrong.

Aaron Pierce: [President Logan has Aaron held hostage] There is
  nothing that you have said or done that is acceptable to me in the
  least. You're a traitor to your country and a disgrace to your
  office. And it's my duty to see that you're brought to justice.

Petty Officer Rooney: My status is... he's dead.

Jack Bauer: [Phone Conversation] Yeah?
Mike Novick: The President has just notified Secret Service he's
  going to be delayed.
Jack Bauer: How long?
Mike Novick: He didn't say, but Mrs. Logan knows we need as much time
  as possible. Jack... if Logan doesn't confess... how far are you
  actually willing to go?
Jack Bauer: As far as I have to.

Christopher Henderson: [Holds Jack at gunpoint] Hold it, Jack! Now
  lower your arms, real slow, and turn around! You weren't ever
  really gonna let me go, were you?
Jack Bauer: No.
Christopher Henderson: [Tries to shoot Jack, but the trigger clicks
  empty] Good for you, Jack.

Jack Bauer: You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer, Tony
  Almeida, and Michelle Dessler. They were friends of mine.

Jack Bauer: [Jack is dressed as a co-pilot and holds the "Marine 1"
  pilot at gunpoint] Captain... I can fly this thing if i have to,
  which leaves you with one of two choices; you either do as i say
  and you live, or you don't and you die for nothing, do you
  understand me?

Cheng Zhi: [Holding Jack hostage] You surely must be aware, Mr.
  Bauer, that China has a long memory. Only eighteen months ago, you
  invaded our territory and killed our consul. [Leaning to Jack] Did
  you really think that we would forget? Hmm?
Jack Bauer: [Weakly] I know how this works... I need to make one
  phone call... Please... just one phone call. [pause, until Jack
  spits at Cheng, and Cheng's men are throwing Jack on the floor]
  Kill me... Just... kill me...
Cheng Zhi: Kill you? You're far too valuable to kill, Mr. Bauer.

Jack Bauer: A year and a half ago, I was warned that my life was in
  danger by someone within the government. I was told the only way I
  could stay alive was to create the illusion that I was dead. I was
  forced to deceive people that I loved. My only daughter will never
  forgive me. As I see the depth of your corruption unfold, I have no
  doubt that you are that source of danger. David Palmer was a great
  man, and he was a great President. He was also my friend. He tried
  to warn me about you and now he is dead. Other people tried to help
  me, and they are dead, too. So Mr. Logan, I hope you understand...
  I have absolutely nothing to lose. You are going to be held
  accountable for your part of everything that happened today. You
  will not be able to hide behind the Presidency - right here, right
  now, you are going to face justice! And make no mistake about this,
  this is personal. And if you think for a second that I am scared to
  put a bullet in your brain, you don't know me. I am going to ask
  you one last time. Who are your co-conspirators? You have until the
  count of three, or I will kill you.

Jack Bauer: What are the names of your co-conspirators?
Charles Logan: There are no co-conspirators, because there is no
  conspir...
Jack Bauer: [interrupts, yelling] WALT CUMMINGS! CHRISTOPHER
  HENDERSON, and James Nathanson have all admitted to being part of
  this conspiracy, now they are dead! Right before Christopher
  Henderson died, he acknowledged that there were others, what are
  their names?
Charles Logan: A man will say anything under torture, this won't mean
  a thing.
Jack Bauer: Mr. Logan, I'm not here to torture you, but you are gonna
  tell what i want to know, or so help me god, I will kill you.

[Charles's final threat to keep Martha silent]
Charles Logan: And I tell you something else, Martha. If you blow up
  like this again I'll fill you so full of drugs you won't even
  remember your own name. And then I will have you shipped off to an
  asylum where you can spend the rest of your life there if you like.
  Are we clear?
[Martha's so shaken up that she can't even an answer right away]
Charles Logan: I said... *are we clear?*
Martha Logan: [completely broken down sobbing] Yes.
Charles Logan: Good. Now get yourself cleaned up. You're a mess.

Barry Landes: Just, everybody breathe.

Tony Almeida: Yeah, you're probably right Jack. I'll let you know.

Jack Bauer: This won't make you feel any better Tony, believe me.
Tony Almeida: Yeah, you're probably right Jack. I'll let you know.

  that she dosen't wish to see him anymore] Are you ok?

  Your name came up.
Graham: Damn it. We should've killed Jack when we had the chance

Mike Doyle: Jack, what's the problem?

President Wayne Palmer: You're asking me to sign off on a probable
  suicide mission!
Jack Bauer: With all due respect, Mr. President, sixteen hours ago
  your people were willing to hand me over for dead, and I did not
  hesitate.
[pause]
Jack Bauer: Mr. President, you owe me.

Graem Bauer: It has nothing to do with McCarthy. It has to do with
  Palmer.
Jack Bauer: David Palmer?
Graem Bauer: Yeah. I gave the order for his assassination.
[Jack backs away in shock]
Graem Bauer: And agent Tony Almeida and agent Michelle Dessler. Your
  co-workers, they're all dead because of me. I arranged everything:
  I set the timetable, I paid off the killers, I even lured you out
  of hiding to take the fall. Today wasn't the first time I've tried
  to have you killed, Jack.

Bill Buchanan: Unbelievable. That's what Graem was holding back?
Jack Bauer: Not only was he responsible for David Palmer's
  assassination, he directed the entire conspiracy. He was trying to
  protect the company. That's what he's trying to do now.
Bill Buchanan: Incredible.
Jack Bauer: I wish it got us closer to the nukes, but it doesn't. He
  doesn't know where McCarthy is.

Jack Bauer: CTU, this is Bauer... We've got a problem.

Phillip Bauer: Graem's death was not an accident. I killed him.

Cheng Zhi: [to Phillip, over the phone] You repair the circut board
  and return it to us, or there'll be serious consequences!
Phillip Bauer: Now, you listen to me. I'm not afraid of you, Cheng.
  And the next time you threat at me, the consequences will be
  serious... but not for me.


# "24" (2001) {Day 6: 3:00 p.m.-4:00 p.m. (#6.10)}
Jack Bauer: We didn't find Gredenko.
Philip Bauer: [about to execute Jack] Then all of this was for
  nothing. On your knees. It didn't have to end like this Jack. [Aims
  at Jack's head behind him] You could've had it all.
Jack Bauer: I just want you to know, I didn't want you to feel like I
  had turned my back on you, that I turned my back on the family. I
  just had to go in my own way, to do things for myself, and I... was
  never good enough for you. I'm sorry. Anyway... I'm ready. What are
  you waiting for...? DO IT! DAMN YOU!

  pregnant.
Morris O'Brian: [stunned] You mean... what, with child?
Chloe: That's usually how it works.
Morris O'Brian: Chloe...
Chloe: You know, this is a nice moment. Let's not ruin it by saying
  something stupid.

Jack Bauer: In case you've forgotten, I'm very good at disappearing -
  and if you try sending someone after us I'll kill 'em. Pretty good
  at that too.

Charles Logan: [about Russian Consul Markov] He says he hasn't spoken
  to Gredenko in a year. He's lying - they're still in contact, and
  he knows enough about what's going on and and wanted to deny that.
Jack Bauer: How do you know?
Charles Logan: Because I've done enough lying myself to know the
  signs.


# "24" (2001) {Day 6: 6:00 a.m.-7:00 a.m. (#6.1)}
[at about 6:30am]
Jack Bauer: [to Bill Buchanan] Do you know the difference between
  dying for nothing and dying for something. That's why I'm still
  alive. That's the only reason why I managed to stay alive in China,
  so I wouldn't die for nothing. Today, I can die for something.
[about 20-25 minutes later, around 6:55am; Jack Bauer is being
  tortured very badly]
Abu Fayed: [while torturing Jack Bauer] Funny you should mention
  Assad. Assad's been talking about renouncing violence and
  negotiating.
Abu Fayed: [prepares to jam a sharp metal rod in Jack's back] Assad
  is a traitor to the cause. And soon he will be dead. That's right,
  Jack. CTU is about to kill the wrong man. Assad isn't behind these
  attacks. He's come here to stop them. He's come here to stop... me.
Abu Fayed: [jams the metal rod into Jack's back]
Jack Bauer: [gasping in beaut pain]
Abu Fayed: [pulls the rod out after a few seconds and drops it on the
  floor and finishes with] You will die for nothing.

Jack Bauer: Do you understand the difference between dying for
  something and dying for nothing? Today I can die for something. My
  way. My choice

Middle Eastern Man: [running after bus, yelling] I have as much right
  to be on the bus as you!

Jack Bauer: Do you understand the difference between dying for
  something and dying for nothing? Thats why I fought so hard to stay
  alive in China, because I didn't want to die for nothing. Today, I
  can die for something.


# "24" (2001) {Day 6: 6:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m. (#6.13)}

Milo Pressman: You aren't going to make this easy for me, are you?
Nadia Yassir: You know what? Actually, I am. Whatever you thought
  might happen between us you can just forget it.
Milo Pressman: That's not fair.
Nadia Yassir: Milo, believe it or not, I don't even blame you for
  suspecting me. But you have to admit that this is not the best
  place to start a relationship.
Milo Pressman: Gah- [kisses her]

  do it faster!

[Abu Fayed and Dmitri Gredenko sneak into a bar, unfortunately full
  of people and on the TV is the news about the day]
Dmitri Gredenko: [lets Fayed walk ahead looks at TV] I know that man.
  I recognize him. [points at Abu] He's that man there!
Abu Fayed: [angrily] You son of a bitch!
[all hell breaks loose as Fayed tries shooting Gredenko but he
  manages to get behind a wall. Some of the patrons go after Fayed
  but Fayed shoots one and then runs dry on his pistol. Everyone
  takes advantage of this and knocks Fayed to the ground beating him
  up until Jack Bauer comes in firing 2 shots into the ceiling]
Jack Bauer: I'm a federal agent! I need you to step away so I can
  take that guy into custody. He's a wanted man!
Bar Guy: He just shot my friend!
Jack Bauer: I'm sorry about that, but I'll get an EMT in here
  quickly.
Abu Fayed: [spits] I hope your friend dies!

Jack Bauer: I'm not with anyone until someone starts answering some
  questions. [turns to Tony] Let's start with you. Why the hell
  aren't you dead?

Chloe: I'm glad you're with us.
Jack Bauer: I'm not with anybody until someone starts answering
  questions. [turns to Tony] Might as well start with you. Why are
  you not dead?

[about Jack returning to the United States after his stint in
  Sangala]
David Emerson: Why'd you come back?
Jack Bauer: Wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller.
David Emerson: [unamused] That's funny.

Jack Bauer: Not today.

  supposed to know where your loyalties really lie?

  looking for any validation.

  ever pull your weapon on me again, you better intend to use it.
Renee Walker: I did.


# "24" (2001) {Day 7: 6:00 a.m.-7:00 a.m. (#7.23)}

Senator Blaine Mayer: You're reprehensible, Bauer.
Jack Bauer: And you, sir, are weak! Unwilling and unable to look evil
  in the eye and deal with it!

President Allison Taylor: In your opinion, is Bauer's intelligence
  actionable?
Ethan Kanin: Bauer says there's going to be an attack, my belief is
  there's going to be an attack.


# "24" (2001) {Day 7: 7:00 a.m.-8:00 a.m. (#7.24)}

[being questioned about previous illegal actions taken by CTU]
Jack Bauer: The difference between success and failure is your
  ability to adapt to your enemy. The people that I deal with, they
  don't care about your rules. All they care about is a result.

Jack Bauer: I am more than willing to be judged by the people you
  claim to represent. I will let them decide what price I should pay.
  But please do not sit up there with that smug look on your face and
  expect me to regret the decisions I have made. Because, sir, the

  rifle on the table] You know, about four hours ago, a friend of
  mine, a very good friend, Renee Walker, was killed by rifle just
  like that.
Pavel: Go to hell.

Jack Bauer: When you first came to CTU, I never thought it was going
  to be you, that was going to cover my back all those years. And I
  know that everything that you did today, was to try and protect me.
  I know that.

  And Quinten didn't hurt Kit Thompson. I call that real luck in my
  book.
Capt. Tom Rynning: Maybe you're not reading the right book.

Dr. Adrianne Holland: [after Seger describes a medical journal
  article] How do you know about that?
Dr. Jonathan Seger: [Sarcastic] Jonathan Seger, I work in the medical
  field. Pleased to meet you.

Dr. Adrianne Holland: What can we do for a man with prosopagnosia?
Dr. Douglas Hanson: Validate his parking.

Dr. Douglas Hanson: Odds are fear expressed numerically. They give
  people who don't trust their judgement a meaningless number to hide
  behind

Dr. Douglas Hanson: When you wake up in the morning, and you hear
  that the chance of rain is 80%, do you always grab your umbrella?
Dr. Jonathan Seger: Yeah.
Dr. Douglas Hanson: I always look out the window. We're doing the
  surgery.

Dr. Adrianne Holland: I love the night sky. It reminds me that I'm a
  lucky coincidence of water molecules floating through space on a
  rock.


# "3 lbs." (2006) {Lost for Words (#1.1)}
Dr. Jonathan Seger: Then I should go take polyps off colons, because
  I can't screw around in somebody's head not know whose soul I'm
  bumping up against.

Melania Ortiz: [Carrying his belongings in a box, Dr. Seger is led by
  Melania to Dr. Hanson's office] He's expecting you for a patient
  consult in his office; they're about to start.
Dr. Jonathan Seger: Right now? I haven't even unpacked my things!
Melania Ortiz: Why don't you leave them in the box? See how it goes?

Dr. Adrianne Holland: That's the beauty of being human. There's not
  another species for a billion miles that can make itself scared. We
  think too much


# "3 lbs." (2006) {Of Two Minds (#1.2)}
Dr. Douglas Hanson: Why do you do this Seger?
Dr. Jonathan Seger: Care?
Dr. Douglas Hanson: Oh stop, that's too easy. No, try to put yourself
  in their shoes?
Dr. Jonathan Seger: Oh, because fourth year I took a seminar entitled
  "Putting Yourself in Their Shoes".

Kate: What does it feel like?
Dr. Douglas Hanson: What?
Kate: When you wake up and the two sides of your brain aren't
  connected anymore?
Dr. Douglas Hanson: Well, I had one patient who said it was as though
  she had been living with a roommate all her life and she'd finally
  gotten her own apartment.


# "3-South" (2002) {Cocktail (#1.12)}
Sanford: [with Ed, Del and chicken] Genetics is fascinating. For
  example, if I mated with this chicken, I wonder if any of you would
  tell.

Del Swanson: [hugs chicken protectively] You can't kill it. I love
  it. It's like a chicken to me.
Sanford: That's just the way of the world, Del. If something doesn't
  contribute, it has to be eliminated. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
  gonna go take a nap.


# "3-South" (2002) {College Material (#1.1)}
Chuck the Janitor: Flunking out? I wouldn't worry about it. Could be
  the best thing that ever happened to you. I used to pay $3,000 a
  year to go here, then I flunked out. Now they pay me $3,000 a year
  to come here. Who do you think got the last laugh there? [a student
  bursts in and vomits all over. Chuck grabs mop] Chuck's time to
  shine.


# "3-South" (2002) {Midnight Del (#1.8)}
Del Swanson: [Refusing to yell out window] My mom told my when I'm
  indoors to use my indoor voice.
Sanford: The doctor told me I should use that medicine to stop the
  worms in my hair, but you don't see me caving into pressure.


# "3-South" (2002) {New Friends (#1.3)}
Sanford: [studying, with Del and Joe] Hey, who was that president
  with the beard and the top hat?
Joe: Abraham Lincoln.
Sanford: No, this guy gave a really important speech about slavery or
  something.
Joe: It's Lincoln, you moron. Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg
  Address.
Sanford: You're thinking of someone else. The guy I'm talking about
  was involved in a big war.
Joe: The Civil War! How stupid can you -
Del Swanson: Uncle Sam?
Sanford: That's it! Uncle Sam. Thanks, man.
Del Swanson: No problem. I'm kind of a history buff.


# "30 Days of Night: Dust to Dust" (2008)
Detective Gina Harcourt: Nick, you turned in your badge this morning.
  You can't touch this!
Detective Nick Maguire: It's my sister, Gina.
Detective Gina Harcourt: I understand. She's like a sister to me,
  too.
Detective Nick Maguire: [begins to walk away from Gina]
Detective Gina Harcourt: Nick! [stops him] You're going to have to
  trust me.


# "30 Days" (2005)
Reverend Dr. Penny Davis: [talking about homosexuality and the Bible]
  I think God cares more about what we do with our resources than
  what we do with our genitalia.

Host: Oh my gravy!


# "30 Rock" (2006)
Tracy Jordan: I learned fried chicken at the school of hard knocks.

Pete: [Tending to one of three cast members who have been rendered
  unfilmable for that week's episode] Liz Taylor really messed him
  up! He might have brain damage.
Liz Lemon: God. Maybe the musical guest can do some extra songs this
  week. Who is it?
Pete: James Blunt.
Liz Lemon: Ugghh.

Liz Lemon: Why are you wearing a tux?
Jack: It's after 6 o'clock Lemon. What am I, a farmer?

[repeated line]
Liz Lemon: Blurg.

[repeated line]
Liz Lemon: I want to go to there.

Liz Lemon: What the what?

Liz Lemon: Where are you headed with this?

Liz Lemon: Hey, nerds! Who has two thumbs, speaks limited French and
  hasn't cried once today? This moi.

Jack: Let's do it. Let's move here. We'll get a little cabin in the
  woods.
Celeste Cunningham: I'll plant heirloom tomatoes, we'll ride our
  bikes into town.
Jack: I'll grow a beard. People from my old life will pass us through
  town and won't even recognize me, they'll just say, "Thanks, Pap,"
  and then they'll buy some of my cider. [Jack's cell phone rings]
Celeste Cunningham: Ugh, the real world calling. [Jack throws his
  cell phone into the pond] Oh, my god! [C.C. throws her cell phone
  too]
Jack: [shouts] I'M IN LOOOOVE!
Coal Miner: God, I wish this town weren't halfway between DC and New
  York.

Liz Lemon: [Liz is calling a co-op board and getting more drunk]
  [10:20 PM] Hey, it's Liz Lemon. This message is for the co-op
  board, I guess This is the number you gave me, I hope it's not
  fake. 'Cause you accepted my bid and I haven't heard from you. But
  I'm doing great. I bought a German television studio today.
Liz Lemon: [10:55 PM] Does everyone know that you're a bunch of liars
  or should I tell them myself, because I know a lot of people.
Liz Lemon: [11:14 PM] You know what? I'm fine. Because I know who I
  am. You, I feel sorry for you, co-op board
Liz Lemon: [12:01 AM] [Liz is on the floor of her bathroom] I AM
  GOING TO THE HOSPITAL! AND I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY!
Liz Lemon: [12:03 AM] I'm just confused. It seems weird to me that
  you would still be advertising the apartment after you accepted my
  offer.
Liz Lemon: [2:15 AM] [Liz is singing] And I'm here to remind you...
Liz Lemon: [7:00 AM] You know what? I've moved on. I bought a whole
  bunch of apartments. I bought a black apartment.

Tracy Jordan: Live every week like it's Shark Week.

Angie Jordan: It's my way 'til payday

Jack: Lemon, I would like to teach you something. I would like to be
  Michelle Pfeiffer to your angry black kid who learns that poetry is
  just another way to rap

Tracy Jordan: I love this cornbread so much I want to take it behind
  the middle school and get it pregnant

Tracy Jordan: So what's your religion, Liz Lemon?
Liz Lemon: I pretty much do whatever Oprah tells me to do

Jack: All of my summer replacement shows were big hits: "America's
  Next Top Pirate", "Are You Stronger Than a Dog?", "MILF Island"...
Liz Lemon: "MILF Island"?
Jack: Twenty-five super-hot moms, 50 eighth-grade boys, no rules.
Liz Lemon: Oh yeah, didn't one of those women turn out to be a
  prostitute?
Jack: That doesn't mean she's not a wonderful, caring MILF.

Dr. Leo Spaceman: Boy, it's crazy to think we used to settle
  questions of paternity by dunking a woman in water until she
  admitted she made it all up. Different time, the '60s.

Jack: I'm not a creative type like you, with your work sneakers and
  left-handedness.

Kenneth Parcell: It's like my heart is trying to hug my brain!

Tracy Jordan: I'm whipped! Angie got me up at 7:30 today. Did you
  know that in the morning, they have food, TV, almost everything.
  It's pretty good.

Jack: Look how Greenzo's testing! They love him in every demographic:
  colored people, broads, fairies, commies. Gosh, we gotta update
  these forms.

Jack: Lemon, I'm impressed. You're beginning to think like a
  businessman.
Liz Lemon: A businesswoman.
Jack: I don't think that's a word.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Anna Howard Shaw Day (#4.13)}
Liz Lemon: Avery Jessup, yeah, she's hot. She was on Maxim's "I'd
  Rape That 100."

Liz Lemon: You know, there are some things that are actually harder
  to do with two people. Like, monologues.

Liz Lemon: Tray, I need you to pick me up from the dentist.
Tracy Jordan: No can do, Liz Lemon. Every Valentines Day, Angie and I
  rent a heart-shaped tub to make chili on. Then we take it to the
  homeless shelter, and that's when things start getting sexy.

Frank Rossitano: You are no different. You just want to know somone
  cares about you. Only your case is worse, because that tooth
  infection could spread to your brain and kill you.
Liz Lemon: Yeah, well when I'm a ghost, I'll haunt you in your sleep.
Frank Rossitano: Then you're gonna see some disgusting stuff.

Jenna Maroney: You know what I realized? Maynard was the longest
  relationship of my life, after Doug.
Kenneth Parcell: Please don't say who Doug...
Jenna Maroney: Doug is my vibrator.

Liz Lemon: I don't think the anastasia has affectered me at all.

Jenna Maroney: I'm sorry, Liz, I can't stop now. I just got my
  stalker's address from his parole officer, and I have to go
  confront him to find out why he's been ignoring me.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Apollo, Apollo (#3.16)}
Jenna Maroney: The reason I speak with a slight English inflection in
  my voice is because I lost my virginity to the My Fair Lady
  soundtrack.

Tracy Jordan: What is this, Horse-ville? 'Cause I am surrounded by
  nay-sayers! Wordplay!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Argus (#4.19)}
Jack Donaghy: If we can put an ear on a mouse's back, we can
  certainly make a peacock immortal.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Audition Day (#4.4)}
Jack Donaghy: You are at the top of the pyramid. Granted, TGS is a
  small pyramid, but nevertheless it will one day be your tomb. And
  you can't feel sorry for the slaves that built that pyramid, which,
  again, will be your tomb.

Jack Donaghy: I can't have bedbugs. I went to Princeton.
Kenneth Parcell: Sir, everyone can get them. Back in Stone Mountain,
  even the mayor had them, and she was a horse.

Jenna Maroney: We have to stop Jayden Tyler! He's evil, Tracy!
Tracy Jordan: He's evil Tracy? Oh, he's evil, comma, Tracy.

Jack Donaghy: [At the subway] Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jack
  Donaghy, and I have bedbugs. I'm not a drug addict, I'm a
  high-raking executive at the General Electric corporation, and I'm
  just getting my medicine. So if anyone can tell me how to get to
  the four train, I would really appreciate it.

Liz Lemon: The Hornberger System shall prevail.
Jenna Maroney: That's what you think, but the Hornberger System shall
  devail! Is that the opposite of prevail?

Jack Donaghy: Lemon, we're not just hiring an actor, we're hiring a
  coworker, a human being, and I say we hire the one who lives by the
  code of the robot: Care, Love, Live.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Believe in the Stars (#3.2)}
Oprah Winfrey: I want to help you. What can I do?
Liz Lemon: Can you please say "Please welcome Liz Lemoooooooon!"
Oprah Winfrey: No.

Liz Lemon: [dressed up as Princess Leia] I don't think its fair for
  me to be a juror, because I can read people's thougts.
Judge: Dismissed!

Jack Donaghy: Lemon, does Kenneth look up to you?
Liz Lemon: Of course he does. Kenneth looks up to everybody. He even
  calls Tracy's lizard Sir.

Kenneth Parcell: Is SpongeBob SquarePants supposed to be terrifying?
Jack Donaghy: You're darn right he is.

Tracy Jordan: Do you know who I am? Seriously, please tell me who I
  am!

Liz Lemon: [drowsy from pills] I'ma call you back. I's sitting next
  to Borpo!

Liz Lemon: [on her cellphone, under the influence of tranquilizers on
  an airplane, with Oprah Winfrey as a seatmate] I'ma call you back.
  I'm snitting nexxa Borpo.

Liz Lemon: Coma Naprosil? May cause dizziness, sexual nightmares, and
  sleep crime.
Jack Donaghy: It's very good.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Black Light Attack! (#4.10)}
Tracy Jordan: How come your teeth don't glow in the black light,
  Kenneth?
Kenneth Parcell: I don't know. You'll have to ask the man who
  whittled them for me.

Pete Hornberger: What do you think will happen when she realizes
  she's playing the mother?
Liz Lemon: We can worry about that later. Maybe we'll be dead by
  then.
Pete Hornberger: Yeah. Wouldn't that be great?

Jenna Maroney: Mother? I'm not a mother! Would a mother be planning a
  summer sex tour of Vietnam?
Liz Lemon: You're not young anymore. You can't keep playing prom
  queens and runaway victims anymore.
Jenna Maroney: But those were my majors at the Tampa School of Acting
  Tricks.

Liz Lemon: Everyone, I'd like you all to met Tom. Tom Selleck. He's
  my mustache.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Black Tie (#1.12)}
Pete Hornberger: [in a high-pitched voice to his kid over the phone]
  Elmo wants you to aim your pee-pee at the potty! No, not at Mommy,
  at the potty! How is that Elmo's fault? Did Mommy have some wine
  before she called Elmo?

Jenna Maroney: We gotta boogie, gang!

Jack Donaghy: [regarding the physical deformities of Prince Gerhardt]
  Most people in his situation would be angry with his family for the
  centuries of inbreeding, but not Gerhardt. He's too busy trying to
  stave off infection.

Kenneth Parcell: [Kenneth finds Pete dancing with a very attractive
  woman at an impromptu party Tracy has thrown in the office] What
  are you doing? You are a married man!
Pete Hornberger: Hey, I'm not doing anything wrong. Just... I'm just
  dancing, Kenneth.
Kenneth Parcell: Do you remember the movie "Footloose," where those
  evil kids won in the end? You're going to make a mistake tonight.
Tracy Jordan: [sleazy] You're going to make a mistake tonight!
Kenneth Parcell: Remember the vows you and your wife took in that
  church.
Pete Hornberger: Botanical garden.
Kenneth Parcell: Botanical garden. You promised fidelity -
Tracy Jordan: Lick her face!
Kenneth Parcell: Think of God!
Pete Hornberger: Look, both of you calm down. I'm just trying to have
  some fun for the first time in, like, ten years.

Bianca Donaghy: [Jack is passing Liz off has his girlfriend to his
  ex-wife] She's much sharper than the last girl you had. What was
  her name?
Jack Donaghy: Beyoncé.

Josh Girard: The crew is playing a game of 'The Dozens' Your momma is
  so stupid she thought an iMac was a new hamburger at McDonald's.
Liz Lemon: What's the difference between your momma and a washing
  machine? When I drop a load in the washing machine it doesn't
  follow me around for a week.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Blind Date (#1.3)}
Jack: How was your evening with Thomas?
Liz Lemon: You mean Gretchen Thomas, the brilliant plastics engineer
  slash lesbian? What made you think I was gay?
Jack: Your shoes.
Liz Lemon: Well I'm straight.
Jack: Those shoes are definitely bi-curious.
Liz Lemon: Regardless, I am straight. One-hundred precent completely
  straight.
Jack: Well I'm sorry if I offended you.

Jack: [implying that mood affects the performance of his employees
  and that Liz always seems to be unhappy] Human contact is
  important, Lemon. I can tell from your stress level that you've not
  been touched in any way for quite some time. Not caressed. Not
  massaged. Not even groped on the subway. Do you agree that you need
  someone in your life, Lemon?
Liz Lemon: No. I have bigger things to worry about than my personal
  life.
Jack: I would think that the single woman's biggest worry would be
  choking to death in her apartment.

Liz Lemon: [feeling jittery before the blind date set up for her by
  Jack] Hey, Frank! What do guys like?
Frank: Porn.
Liz Lemon: No, I mean if you are gonna go on a date with a woman, how
  would you want her to act?
Frank: Like she is in porn.

Jack: [running into Liz in the hallway on the day of the blind date
  he set up for her] What are gonna wear?
Liz Lemon: This probably [indicating she will wear her office
  clothes] . I don't have time to go home
Jack: That won't do. [fishes a wad of cash from his pocket and
  proceeds to give Lemon some money] I want you to go out in your
  lunch hour and find something. [pauses before emphasizing] in a
  *women's* clothing store.

Liz Lemon: What do you say, we make a pact? If, say, in twenty-five
  years, neither of us has found somebody. We'll move in together and
  become roomates. And even though I am... not into the sex stuff, if
  it helps you, I would let you... do stuff to me.
Gretchen Thomas: I can't be around anymore. Bye Liz.
Liz Lemon: That's funny. That's what the guys always say.

Jack Donaghy: All right then. You're not a lesbian. Duly noted. I'll
  correct that on your file. It's too bad, though. Thomas thought you
  were great.
Liz Lemon: She did?
Jack Donaghy: Yes. She said she thought you looked like Jennifer
  Jason Leigh.
Liz Lemon: Really? She said that?
Jack Donaghy: Yes, I made her repeat it. I was sure she meant Jason
  Lee.

Liz Lemon: Who's gonna go with me to cooking class next weekend?
Guy at Bar: Well if by 'cooking class' you mean 'your bed' and by
  'next weekend' you mean 'tonight'...
Liz Lemon: Oh, shut up. [he does] I can see your wedding ring. Idiot.

Pete Hornberger: [to Liz] Hey, look at you! You look like fancy
  prostitute!

Jack: You are a puzzle Kenneth Allen. And I'm going to solve you.

Liz Lemon: Kenneth, why did you play that terrible hand?
Kenneth Parcell: Why? Because I believe that life is for the living.
  I believe in taking risks and biting off more than you can chew.
  And also, people were yelling, and I got confused about the rules.

Jack: The Italians have a saying, Lemon: 'Keep your friends close,
  and your enemies closer.' And although they've never won a war or
  mass-produced a decent car, in this case they're right. [about
  Kenneth] In five years we'll all either be working for him... or be
  dead by his hand.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Brooklyn Without Limits (#5.7)}
Steven Austin: You probably know me from the future, where I am the
  President of the United States, Steve Austin.

Liz Lemon: You don't know what you're talking about: [turns around to
  show label on back of her jeans] Hand-made in USA.
Jack Donaghy: You're magic jeans are from BDL? Oh Lemon, it's not
  hand-made in USA, it's pronounced Hand-made in Usa. The Hand people
  are Vietnamese slave tribe and Usa is their island prison. They
  made your jeans. You know how they get the stitching so small?
  [puts hands to mouth and whispers] orphans.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish (#5.9)}
Jenna Maroney: Relationships are like sharks, Liz. If you're not left
  with several bite marks after intercourse, then something's wrong.

Jenna Maroney: Liz, last night was a disaster. And not the good kind
  where I get to sing at a benefit.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Christmas Attack Zone (#5.10)}
Liz Lemon: Who hasn't made mistakes? I once French kissed a dog at a
  party to try to impress what turned out to be a very tall
  12-year-old.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Christmas Special (#3.6)}
Colleen Donaghy: Exhibit A: You're cell phone bill. You made a call
  to 911 at 8:16 AM. Exhibit B: The watch that my son gave me for
  Christmas. Not the one I wanted by the way. You had just set it
  before it broke of course when you car rammed into me down in
  Florida. And it stopped at 8:08. Exhibit C: 16-8=8! Numbers, unlike
  children, don't lie. What kind of son...
Jack: What kind of mother tells her son that John Kennedy died
  because he talked in church? Or tells her son when he was voted
  captain of the diving team, quote "What a great way to meet guys?"
  Or invites strange men over on Christmas Eve?

Jack: Have I told you about my mom's yuletide boyfriend, Frederick
  August Otto Schwarz III.
Liz Lemon: FAO Swartz? Like the toy store?
Jack: His family owned some toy stores, yes. So what?
Liz Lemon: Jack, I think your mother put out on Christmas to get you
  kids presents. She did it for you.
Jack: Not possible. She didn't do anything for us.
Liz Lemon: I know you guys were pretty poor, did you have a lot of
  presents?
Jack: You couldn't even see the tree.

Liz Lemon: Hey, you don't know the Post Master General, do you?
Jack: I do, but we had a falling out over the Jerry Garcia stamp. I
  mean, if I want to lick a hippie, I'll just return Joan Baez's
  phone calls.

  play lacrosse. Lacrosse, Liz Lemon.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {College (#5.8)}
Liz Lemon: Oh, why is Toofer in the punishment corner?
Toofer: I said: [posh pronunciation] 'time to end the charade and
  adjust my schedule to buy a new vase'.
Liz Lemon: [disgusted] Oh, you stay there, you stay there until you
  die!

Jack Donaghy: [Lemon is telling a longwinded tale] Don't worry about
  getting to your point, I'm going to live forever.

Liz Lemon: You know, usually everyone around here makes me feel like
  Hitler, but today, I feel like... Hitler in Germany.

Jack Donaghy: Look: the display is malfunctioning.
TK-421 Microwave: Defrost. Power. Time left: pizza.
Jack Donaghy: Oh really? That's how much time is left? Pizza?


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Cooter (#2.15)}
Jack Donaghy: We need hope. We need change. We need experience. We
  need pens.

Jenna Maroney: Kenneth, where have you been? I had to put on my jeans
  by myself.

Jenna Maroney: [finding a positive pregnancy test in the trash] Oh
  no, someone's gonna get more attention then me.

Liz Lemon: Oh, so you're the only one in the word that's allowed to
  make sex mistakes? You had a threeway with Roseanne and Tom Arnold.
Jenna Maroney: That was two years ago.

Jack Donaghy: Cooter, look at this place. This can't be what you want
  in life. Haven't you ever thought about leaving?
Cooter Burger: Of course. Every day. Every day for two years. Look at
  these resignation letters [opens desk drawer, takes out a bunch of
  filed letters] They're written in ketchup, dirty rock, leak
  water... But now you're here. You're here and everything's gonna be
  better. Now we've got pens. Glorious pens!

Jack Donaghy: [to C.C] I did certain things for you in bed that you
  were going to reciprocate but then we broke up before my birthday
  so you owe me.

Cooter Burger: Yes! I am so on a role. No crying in my bath tonight.

Jack Donaghy: The ceiling appears to be leaking.
Cooter Burger: No, it's not. We've looked into it and it's not.

Jack Donaghy: Do you need a pen?
Cooter Burger: Nope. I've kind of gotten used to it.
Jack Donaghy: You don't have pens?
Cooter Burger: We're not in a recession.

Cooter Burger: Hey, we have a meeting with the appropriations
  committee, like, now.
Jack Donaghy: Oh no. I'm not prepared.
Cooter Burger: I know. I'm not drunk either, but we'll manage.

Dennis Duffy: Prenatal vitamins. Yeah, I know what 'prenatal' means.
  'Pre-', before; '-natal', ruined.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Corporate Crush (#1.19)}
[Jack is in a museum facing a painting, waiting for Liz Lemon to meet
  him there. Liz appears behind him without announcing her arrival]
Jack: You've been avoiding me, Lemon.
Liz Lemon: How do you do that, without turning around?
Jack: To be perfectly honest, the first couple of people I did that
  to were not you, but... here we are.

Floyd: Well, that movie was a waste of time.
Liz Lemon: I found it moving... my bowels.

Frank Rossitano: I don't like it when Liz is happy. It makes me
  uncomfortable, like when my mother drank margaritas and played
  Tanya Tucker songs.

Jack: I haven't met your boyfriend.
Liz Lemon: His name's Floyd.
Jack: That's unfortunate.

Liz Lemon: [explaining why Jack wants to meet with her at Christie's
  auction house] He goes to Sbarro when he's stressed, the New York
  Stock Exchange when he's horny, and Christie's when he's depressed.

Grizz: [about Tracy's crazy behavior] It's like a roller coaster ride
  of emotion in here.

Tracy Jordan: [Liz walks into her office, and sees Tracy feeding a
  horse] Hey Liz Lemon. Could you go away for a while? I gotta get
  rid of Freddie's erection.

Frank Rossitano: Yo Tray, we got a problem.
President Thomas Jefferson: [refusing to break character] Pray, who
  be this Tracy Jordon thou speakest off?
Frank Rossitano: Eh, President Jefferson, we got a problem.
President Thomas Jefferson: Speakest.
Frank Rossitano: That horse ate your wig.
President Thomas Jefferson: Well, stand guard by his rump and await
  it in his droppings.

Jack: Well, it's really quite simple: men seek out the company of
  other men they admire and want to be like. Floyd is me 20 years
  ago, I'm Don Geiss 30 years ago. 20 years from now, Floyd'll be me,
  I'm gonna be Don Geis and Don Geiss will be dead.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Cougars (#2.7)}
Liz Lemon: You can't be gay for one person. Unless you're a lady. And
  you meet Ellen.

Jack Donaghy: A youthful companion is the ultimate status accessory.
Liz Lemon: Well, maybe you can pull that off, you're a man. It's
  different for women.
Jack Donaghy: That is so sexist of you. To that clueless boy over
  there, you're a very powerful woman. Technically you're a catch.
  You got money, status, naturally thick hair, a decent set.

Kenneth Parcell: [on phone] Sir, conditions have deteriorated. I made
  De Marquee captain like you said, but having a kid from Trinidad in
  charge made the Latino's real mad. And they all seemed to really
  hate my grandpa, 'cause they keep yelling 'kill whitey' and I'm
  like 'what do you think you are, alcohol?
Jack Donaghy: [on cellphone] Right, Kenneth, calm down. There was
  bound to be some unrest once we removed Tracy. They're testing our
  resolve. Stay the course.

Gay Man #2: [calling after Frank] Bye, sexy bear!
Gay Man #1: Terrence, you make us all look so bad.

Jack Donaghy: Stop fighting this. He's hot, poor, and eager to
  please. Just buy him a few gifts, never give him your home phone
  number, and if you set a curfew, stick to it.

Tracy Jordan: Have you ever been to knuckle beach? It's a totally
  different world; a world where orange soda is an acceptable
  substitute for breast milk.

Tracy Jordan: Jenna, I just want you to know that if we find any
  human remains in there, I'm gonna throw up all over your face.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001 (#4.7)}
Liz Lemon: I'm not making this decision based on who's funnier or
  whom I like best, so Toofer, you're in charge.
Toofer: Thank you. In the words of Tennyson...
Liz Lemon: Sorry, you're not in charge.

Liz Lemon: Frank, you're in charge.
Frank Rossitano: Finally, someone cool is in charge. My first order
  is to disable the firewall. Gentlemen, we can surf for porn again!

Tracy Jordan: I like to thank my creative team for coming in such
  short notice. Also, sorry I'm four hours late.

Jenna Maroney: You've created two Lizzes, writer Liz and performer
  Liz. Performers need to be coddled, to be protected from the real
  world.
Jack Donaghy: I get it. I must treat her like the New York Times
  treats its readers.

Pete Hornberger: Boy, if this thing works it could be my ticket out.
  This job is starting to get to me. Lately I've been shoplifting
  just to feel in control. Because no one knows I took the candy bar.
  No one but Peter.

Yakov: I get it. Elegance. That's why people come to Yakov's Nubian
  Bling Explosion.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Do-Over (#3.1)}
Jenna Maroney: [Speaking to a group of friends] I got a residual
  check for that Japanese commercial I did! Three hundred dollars!
  I'm going to use the money to buy us all new boots for myself.

Jack Donaghy: We're not the best people...
Liz Lemon: ...but we're not the worst.
Liz Lemon, Jack Donaghy: Graduate students are the worst!

Tracy Jordan: Let's go shopping. To the Batmobile!
Grizz: [to Liz] Don't worry, he's just leasing it.

Jack Donaghy: What I'm saying is: don't dress for the job you have,
  dress for the job you want to have. So now, Manny?
Manny: Tomorrow I show up for work, dressed as a Mexican Wrestler.

Jack Donaghy: This is G.E.!
Devon Banks: It's just G now, Jack, I sold the E. To Samsung. They're
  Samesung now.

Liz Lemon: Please, just be normalsauce for one day.

Liz Lemon: I got rid of all my Colin Firth movies in case they
  consider them Erotica.
Jack Donaghy: That man can wear a sweater.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Don Geiss, America and Hope (#4.15)}
Jack Donaghy: Truth be told, I have not learnt a lot about Kabletown.
  It's a whole different business model.
Kenneth Parcell: My cousin in Atlanta is a business model. She holds
  up staplers for catalogues.

Jack Donaghy: These are exciting times for NBC. Not Seinfeld,
  Friends, ER exciting. More like 3-D episodes of Merlin exciting.
  But Kabletown is a fine company, even if it is from...
  Philadelphia.
Liz Lemon: Go, Eagles!
[Throws snowball at Jack]
Jack Donaghy: Where did you get a snowball?
Liz Lemon: Philly rules! Cheesesteaks, Bobby Clarke, Wil Smith!
  Boston sucks!
Jack Donaghy: Boston is the greatest city in the world. Boston tea
  party, Boston cream pie, Boston Rob Mariano, birthplace of Benjamin
  Franklin...
Liz Lemon: Yeah, and then he looked around, realized it sucked and
  moved to Philadelphia!

Jenna Maroney: So, how was your date with Wesley?
Liz Lemon: Remember that scene in Notting Hill with the party in the
  garden? I'd rather see that terrible movie five times than go on
  another date with Wesley.

Jack Donaghy: We can still save this. What did she reveal?
Tracy Jordan: Everything! My addiction to prescription lenses, my
  attention deficit disorder... Jack, your shoes are really shiny.

Wesley: This is about love. It's like that brilliant movie, Notting
  Hill. I'm the handsome British man, she's... got certain angles
  that work for her.

Liz Lemon: Wait, your name is Wesley Snipes? That's insane!
Wesley: This is insane? You know what's insane? That the actor is
  named Wesley Snipes! If you were shown a picture of him and a
  picture of me, and were asked "who should be named Wesley Snipes",
  you'd pick the pale Englishman every time! Every time, Liz!

Jenna Maroney: I know what you're going through. I caught a lot of
  flack when I ate the pig that played Babe.

Dot Com: Yet another black superstar taken down by his personal life.
Jenna Maroney: Just like my favorite golf player, O.J. Simpson.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land (#4.21)}
Jack Donaghy: It's gonna be a who's who of New York royalty. The
  Astors, the Rockefellers, the Sbarros...
Avery Jessup: I know, and it kills me. You think I don't want to know
  what Pizzarella Sbarro will be wearing?

Liz Lemon: Three weddings in one day. I'm going to be in Spanx for
  twelve hours. My elastic line is going to get infected again.

Jenna Maroney: You should go to my doctor. He's gay, but not when
  he's drunk.

Liz Lemon: I've been setting my standards too high.
Frank Rossitano: Yes, you have. Meet me in the handicap stall in five
  minutes.

Tracy Jordan: It's all coming back to me! Oh, my God! I slept on a
  dog bed stuffed with wigs! I saw a prostitute stab a clown! Our
  basketball hoop was a ribcage! A ribcage! Why did you bring me
  here? I locked out those memories for a reason! Oh, Lord! A guy
  with dreads electrocuted my fish!

Dr. Drew Baird: Would you like a drink?
Liz Lemon: What goes best with second chances? Ugh, water. I'll have
  water.

Liz Lemon: Oh, my God. I hate you!
Wesley: Yes, that's the only thing wrong with me, isn't it? And with
  that as my only fault, how do I rank with all the other men in your
  life!

Tracy Jordan: Why are we here? I thought we were going somewhere
  boring. This is an awesome copy shop.

Wesley: I can't go back to England. I can't bear the thought of us
  hosting the 2012 Olympics. We're not ready, Liz. Have you seen the
  Beijing opening ceremonies? We don't have that kind of control over
  our people.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Episode 210 (#2.10)}
Liz Lemon: Look at those floors. I would walk all around inside of
  that.
Jenna Maroney: [Jenna walks in, Lemon quickly closes her laptop] Hey,
  what's up?
Jenna Maroney: Are you looking at porn? I know a good site that's
  dirty without sacrificing story. It's by women, for women.
Liz Lemon: No, I'm looking at real estate.

Kenneth Parcell: I don't drink coffee, sir, I don't drink hot liquids
  of any kind. That's the devil's temperature.

Tracy Jordan: Regrets are for horseshoes and handbags.

Jack Donaghy: [to C.C] You're my new night job and I'm gonna love you
  like my boss is watching.

Jack Donaghy: Wanna get drunk?
Liz Lemon: No, there's too many phones in here.

Deutsche Stimme: Love: a urine mirage in a desert of fear.

Deutsche Stimme: [On television] The machine is mankind's madness and
  disfigurement. Industry castrates art. The only honesty is in
  suicide.
Jack Donaghy: I can't watch any more of these German sitcoms!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Fireworks (#1.18)}
Devon Banks: Celebrity snuff. Reality content made exclusively for
  your mobile phone: Oh what's that? MC Lyte just murdered Danny
  Bonaduce? Thanks, PHONE.

Dr. Leo Spaceman: I have the results of your DNA Test, now, I am very
  serious about doctor/patient confidentiality, so I am gunna have to
  ask that all four of us keep this to ourselves.

Tracy Jordan: Doctor Spaceman, when they check my DNA, will they tell
  me what diseases I might get, or help me to remember my ATM pin
  code?
Dr. Leo Spaceman: Absolutely. Science is whatever we want it to be.

Maury Povich: [after discovering that he is a descendant of Thomas
  Jefferson, Tracy is dreaming that he's on "The Maury Povich Show"]
  All right, Tracy. I have the DNA results right here. Are you ready
  to find out who your biological father is?

Tracy Jordan: I think I am.
Maury Povich: Tracy, meet your father, Tom!
Tracy Jordan: No! I hate you, Thomas Jefferson! I don't know who I am
  anymore! You can't be my father!
Sally Hemings: Hey, Maury. He's a dog! He's a dog!
Maury Povich: Sally Hemmings just called you a dog, Thomas Jefferson.
Thomas Jefferson: No matter, Maurice. I am here for you, Tracy
  Jordan. I rode a horse all the way from heaven to tell you
  something important. America, which I invented... [the audience
  boos, and Jefferson makes a pixelated rude gesture to the
  audience]... which I invented, is a great country because we are
  not burdened by our pasts. Embrace who you are, Tracy Jordan. And
  may the force be with you always.

Liz Lemon: You're worried about that guy?
Jack Donaghy: Banks is in New York for a reason, and I intend to send
  him back to L.A.
Liz Lemon: Wow, if this turns into a showdown, you guys could settle
  it with a [imitating Jack's gravelly voice] "talking like this
  contest."

Jack Donaghy: Banks is no slouch: He pioneered the concept of
  ten-second internet sitcoms.

Jack Donaghy: I want you on this, Lemon. Those jokes you wrote for my
  Mitt Romney fundraiser, they were top-notch.
Liz Lemon: Those weren't jokes! That was an appeal for a return to
  common sense and decency.
Jack Donaghy: Well, they got big laughs.

[Tracy is trying to avoid a subpoena regarding a paternity test]
Toofer: How do you know it's not your child?
Tracy Jordan: 'Cause I remember the girl, and it's impossible. I
  never got out of my car, and she never got all the way out of her
  tollbooth.

Jack Donaghy: Good God; Devon is gay. He's even more powerful than I
  thought.
Liz Lemon: [facetiously] Maybe you should seduce him and get him to
  tell you all his secret plans.
[cut to Kenneth sitting in front of Jack's desk]
Kenneth Parcell: So, Mr. Donaghy, what can I do for you?

[Jack wants a naïve Kenneth to gather intelligence about Devon Banks]
Jack Donaghy: You should get to know Devon; tell him all of your
  television ideas. You know, he started off as a page, just like
  you.
Kenneth Parcell: Really? So did I!

Tracy Jordan: Dr. Spacemen, when they check my DNA, will it tell me
  what diseases I might get, or help me to remember my ATM PIN code?
Dr. Leo Spaceman: Absolutely. Science is whatever we want it to be.

Dr. Leo Spaceman: Boy, it's crazy to think we used to settle
  questions of paternity by dunking a woman in water until she
  admitted she made it all up. [Chuckles] Hmm, different time in the
  '60s.

[it is the night of Jack's big NBC fireworks show. Liz, Pete, and
  Floyd watch on TV]
Al Roker: [on TV] Welcome to the "Rockefellar Center Salute to
  Fireworks." Now, without further ado, three hours of fireworks!
[numerous fireworks surround the building, growing in intensity]
Floyd: Wait, fireworks... in midtown?
Liz Lemon: On a day that's *not* the 4th of July.
[the fireworks continue to gain intensity and a high shot on TV shows
  what looks like explosions surrounding the building]
Pete Hornberger: [spits out his popcorn] Oh, my God!
Liz Lemon: [dryly] Oh, boy. That's gonna scare a lot of people.

Floyd: I feel more confused and betrayed than those people that
  worked with Tootsie.

Liz Lemon: I'm really sorry about what I did. And I know you can't
  forgive me but just to even things out, here is all my weird secret
  stuff. I have been sexually rejected by not one, but two guys who
  later went to clown college. I get super nervous whenever I hear a
  vacuum cleaner because when I was a kid, my mom used to turn on the
  vacuum to drown out the sound of her and my dad fighting. Which is
  why I rarely vacuum my apartment. Like, never. I have had three
  doughnuts so far today. Once in college, I pooped my pants a little
  bit at a country steaks all you can eat buffet and I didn't leave
  until I finished my second plate of shrimp. A couple months ago, I
  went on a date with my cousin. Wow, I am a mess. There is an 80%
  chance that in the next election I will tell all my friends that
  I'm voting for Barack Obama but I will secretly vote for John
  McCain. Here's one: when I was a kid, I used to put on my fanciest
  nightgown and then I would mix orange soda and cream soda in a
  champagne glass and I would sit in the dark and watch The Love
  Boat. Consequently, I have some weird sexual fantasy stuff about
  Gopher from The Love Boat. And I lied. I have had five doughnuts
  today.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Floyd (#4.16)}
Kenneth Parcell: Ms. Lemon, a mister DeBarber called.
Liz Lemon: Seriously?
Kenneth Parcell: [serious voice] A mister DeBarber called.

Danny Baker: We should call ourselves something.
Jack Donaghy: What's the most handsome animal?
Danny Baker, Jack Donaghy: The Silver Panthers!

Jack Donaghy: Darn liberal media. That's why I always get my news
  from Dick Cheney's website, Dicknews.com

Jenna Maroney: I just had another Kenneth dream!
Tracy Jordan: Me too! But how do I know this isn't another dream?
  Wait a minute. All my teeth are loose. This is real.

Floyd: How do you stay single, Liz? There are so many men out there
  that you can control and poison.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Flu Shot (#3.8)}
Dr. Spaceman: When is modern science going to find a cure for a
  woman's mouth?

Dr. Spaceman: If you want a shot, you're gonna have to dance for it.
Dr. Spaceman: [Liz dances] Very nice.

Jenna Maroney: They need medicine. And what's the best medicine?
Tracy Jordan: Medicine?

Jack Donaghy: Come on, Lemmon. What do we elites do when we screw up?
  We pretend it never happened and give ourselves a giant bonus.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Future Husband (#4.14)}
Jenna Maroney: Where is everyone? I need someone to be outraged to!

Tracy Jordan: I wonder if they give awards for tarantula
  displacement?

Liz Lemon: Still haven't found your wallet, Kenneth?
Kenneth Parcell: Yeah, and I realize I had a prescription in there
  that I really need. It keeps me from... [Starts convulsing and
  braying] Don't worry, it's just a donkey spell.

Jack Donaghy: I'm the protege of a dead man working at a company that
  no longer exists. You hear that? It's the sound of me being erased
  from contact lists all over the world.
Liz Lemon: You know what I hear? It's the hug plane, and it's coming
  in for a landing.
Jack Donaghy: [weeping] You are cleared for landing. [they hug]

Jenna Maroney: Acting is about consistency and control.
Tracy Jordan: Got it. No farting.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Gavin Volure (#3.4)}
Gavin Volure: And, of course, I always keep an empty chair to
  represent all our unfulfilled hopes and dreams. I'm just kidding.
  Elliot Spritz's hooker couldn't make it.

Frank Rossitano: Attention, everyone. I have just been handed a memo
  that each floor has to have a fire marshall, in case of fires,
  terrorist attacks, Cloverfield monsters... but I can't because my
  head is too big for my helmet. So, who wants to volunteer?
Pete Hornberger: Not me. But you have a big head.

Liz Lemon: I guess this is what the kids call a "booty call".
Gavin Volure: I haven't been outside since 1984, and even I know the
  kids don't call it that anymore.

Jack Donaghy: I can't believe you're out of the game. It's like
  Picasso not painting, or Bruce Willis not combining action and rock
  harmonica.

Jack Donaghy: You go to that house and work it like a Chinese
  gymnast: wear something tight, force a smile, and lie about your
  age.

Jack Donaghy: Kenneth, just how much money do you have in your
  savings?
Kenneth Parcell: Well, let's see!
[Kenneth reaches down and picks up a can filled with cash]
Kenneth Parcell: Eighty thousand dollars!
Jack Donaghy: If you don't include Confederate money.
Kenneth Parcell: Four thousand dollars!

Liz Lemon: I just wish I could start a relationship about twelve
  years in, when you really don't have to try anymore, and you can
  just sit around together and goof on TV shows, and then go to bed
  without anybody trying any funny business.

Gavin Volure: You'll be so rich you can run for office without
  pretending to be a fundamentalist.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Generalissimo (#3.10)}
Jack Donaghy: Oh Lemon, this is Elisa.
Liz Lemon: What? Come on, you're a nurse? [shakes hands]
Elisa: Yes, some of us are hot.

Hector Moreda: We laugh alike.
Jack Donaghy: We think alike.
Hector Moreda: At times we even drink alike.
Hector Moreda, Jack Donaghy: You could lose your mind.
[they clink glasses]

Jack Donaghy: Look, you should know I'm doing this for a woman.
  [shows him a picture on his cellphone] This woman.
Hector Moreda: [takes cellphone] Wow... I am super gay and I would
  totally switch for her.

Elisa: Be very careful. El Generalissimo was once a good man. But the
  years of loneliness drove him insane.
Liz Lemon: I am not the Generalissimo, Elisa.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Gentleman's Intermission (#5.6)}
Jack Donaghy: Drive, Intelligence, Humility, Chaos. Or the acronym
  D.I.C.K. I'm looking for D.I.C.K., Avery, and I'm gonna take it
  wherever I can find it.

Avery Jessup: Oh-oh. Crazy hormonal mood swing. [Screaming] Why does
  everything smell like onions?

Kenneth Parcell: Can I have a copy to show Mr. Jordan? It would be
  like watching his own funeral, just like Tom Sawyer. That's a boy
  from my town. We accidentally buried him alive.

Jack Donaghy: Ambition is the willingness to kill the things you love
  and eat them to survive. Haven't you ever read my throw pillow?

Tracy Jordan: I'm Tracy Jordan. When I go to sleep, nothing happens
  in the world.

Jack Donaghy: Shoulders back, Lemon. You're not welcoming people to
  Castle Frankenstein.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Goodbye, My Friend (#3.13)}
Tracy Jordan: I don't need a birthday, 'couse I buy myself all the
  presents I need. And because of my drinking, they're often a
  surprise.

Becca: Excuse me.
Pete Hornberger: Oh God, please don't be a daughter I didn't know
  about.

Jack Donaghy: Now let me hear you say the seven most important words
  in the American judicial system.
Frank Rossitano: My client has no memory of that.
Jack Donaghy: I also would have accepted 'You can't prove that's the
  Governor's semen'.

Sylvia Rossitano: Frankie's father didn't abandon him, he's in hiding
  in Phoenix. Every Rossitano man is either in hiding or six feet
  under. You want me to paint you a picture? 'Cause I did! [gestures
  towards a picture on the wall of a lawyer lying in his own blood in
  a court of law] It's part of a therapy through painting thing...

Jack Donaghy: Lemon, there was once a great American named George
  Henderson. He met a woodland ape or sasquach and despite it's
  dangerous message of environmentalism became it's friend. When the
  time came to do the hard thing and send it back into the forest
  where it belonged, and birds could perch on it's shoulder because
  it was gentle, George Henderson summoned the strenght and by God,
  he did it. Did it hurt? You bet it hurt. Like a bastard. But he did
  it because it was the right thing to do... for the woodland ape.
  You think about that.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Greenzo (#2.5)}
Liz Lemon: This Earth is ruined. We gotta get a new one.

Jenna Maroney: [to Cerie, who's sitting at her desk barefoot] Are
  bare feet "in" or do you just have your shoes off?

Liz Lemon: I am so sorry, Mr. Vice President. This all started when
  Jack...
Al Gore: Quiet! [holds his hand up and listens to nothing] A whale is
  in trouble! I have to go. [starts taking off his suit jacket as
  though he has a superhero outfit on underneath]

Liz Lemon: Oh hey, I, eh, I found your lipstick [hands it over]
Jenna Maroney: Oh. [looks at it] Oh, no, this isn't mine. This is
  Sunset Blush. I wear Tiger Orgasm.

Liz Lemon: Yeah, well Greenzo seems to love himself, too.
Jack Donaghy: So does Don Geiss. He sent me a personal card
  congratulating me... [rubs the signature with a wet finger, it
  smudges]... with a real signature.
Liz Lemon: Wow. If you lick the envelope you could clone him and then
  you'd have two Geisses.
Jack Donaghy: Yeah, right, Lemon. I'm gonna clone Geiss, then compete
  with the Geiss clone for the CEO position? Think it through.

Greenzo: Can you fire the wind, Jack? Can you fire a hurricane?
  [leaves with his green cap flapping in the wind]
Jack Donaghy: [shouts after him] We're developing that technology!

Liz Lemon: People are going to show up expecting all these great
  things, and they'll be really disappointed and angry.
Tracy Jordan: Just like Colonial Williamsburg.

Jack Donaghy: Look how Greenzo's testing. They love him in every
  demographic: colored people, broads, fairies, commies... gosh,
  we've gotta update these forms.

Liz Lemon: Oh boy, OK this earth is ruined! We got to get a new one.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Hard Ball (#1.15)}
Pete: [watching Jenna film a patriotic song and dance number that Liz
  arranged] You know, you actually did a good job on this.
Liz Lemon: Why do you sound so surprised? I love America. Just
  because I think gay dudes should be allowed to adopt kids and we
  should all have hybrid cars doesn't mean I don't love America.
[turns to smile and wink directly into the camera]

Josh Girard: I'm Jack Donaghy. I'm important, I just bought the moon.

Tracy Jordan: I love this cornbread so much, I want to take it behind
  a middle school, and get it pregnant.
Kenneth: [whimsically] Pregnant cornbread...

Tracy Jordan: I love Halo so much, I want to take it behind a middle
  school and get it pregnant.
[others laugh]
Kenneth: Why are you laughing so hard? It's just the same joke he
  said earlier.
Tracy Jordan: That can't be right. I like to keep my material fresh.
  I like it so fresh I want to take it behind a middle school and get
  it pregnant.

Frank Rossitano: These are the sexiest women in comedy? Where's
  Jackée?

Alan: Let's skip the foreplay and get right to the penetration.

Jack Donaghy: What happened in your childhood to make you believe
  people are good?

Tracy Jordan: [thinking his dressing room TV is voice-activated]
  Television on! Pornography!

Jack Donaghy: [Liz has forced Josh to do 'the Worm'] Good Lord, 'the
  Worm'. That's so degrading. Are its origins German?

Liz Lemon: Now say 5 reasons I'm better than you.
Josh Girard: You're smarter than me.
Liz Lemon: One.
Josh Girard: You beat me at arm wrestling.
Liz Lemon: Two.
Josh Girard: Uhh, you read the paper.

  mother's here. An' she loves him. But not in a queer way.

Liz Lemon: [gasping at Dr. Spaceman covered in blood] Ah!
Dr. Leo Spaceman: What? This? No, no. I was at a costume party
  earlier this evening, and the hostess's dog attacked me so... I had
  to stab it.

Phoebe: No, no there has to be some sort of mistake. I'm his fiancée!
Hannah: I'm sorry. You're not family and you're not his emergency
  contact. His mother can go in if she wants to.
Colleen: Oh, no! I'm not going in there. I go in there, I get bird
  flu, I don't come out.

Jack Donaghy: My mouth tastes like purple.

Liz Lemon: [to Kenneth] I will cut you open like a Tauntaun.

Liz Lemon: All right, I'll go. But I want a lobster!
Jack Donaghy: Okay.
Liz Lemon: I want two lobsters! Totaling five pounds of lobster meat!

Jack Donaghy: Maybe this is the drugs talking, but I think I got

Kenneth Parcell: Hey everybody! I got fired today. You won't have
  Kenneth Allen Parcell to kick around anymore. So I'm going to tell
  you people what I really think of you. No. No. For four years I
  have listened to you all complain about your East Coast media elite
  problems, your apartment renovations, and your overpriced Star Wars
  memorabilia.
Carol: That doorman is hammered.
Kenneth Parcell: I have watched you throw away better food than my
  family eats at Christmas. And I have loved it. You people, you are
  my best friends and I hope you get everything you want in life.
[drops microphone]
Jack Donaghy: Kenneth!
Kenneth Parcell: So kiss my face.

# "30 Rock" (2006) {Into the Crevasse (#4.2)}
Liz Lemon: [Looking at her book "Dealbreakers" in a bookstore window,
  to an employee] Hey, I wrote that. I'm Liz Lemon. [Employee opens
  book in front of Liz; she reads from it] "If your boyfriend is over
  thirty and wears a nametag to work, that's a dealbreaker." [Liz
  sees the employee's nametag, it reads Mike] But not you, Mike.
  [Mike takes cutout of Liz] What are you doing, Mike? [Mike starts
  beating up cutout] Oh! You know what, I'm going to beat up your
  cutout! Oh, wait, you don't have one! [Mike tears head off cutout
  and pastes it on window] Ow! Blammo! Another successful interaction
  with a man!

Devon Banks: You know, revenge is a dish best served cold, Jack. Like
  sashimi, or pizza.
Jack Donaghy: You prefer cold pizza?
Devon Banks: The morning after? It's the best.
Jack Donaghy: Better than hot pizza? That's insane.
Devon Banks: You don't tell me what kind of pizza to like!

Tracy Jordan: A book hasn't given me this much trouble since Waldo
  went to that barber pole factory.

Jack Donaghy: You'd ruin an entire company just to get to me? Think
  of the employees, the pensions, the kittens we use to test the
  strength of our microwaves.

Jenna Maroney: I don't know if you know this, but werewolves only
  come out at night.
Liz Lemon: Yes, I learned that from the Thriller video.
Tracy Jordan: Too soon.

Liz Lemon: Tracy and Jenna are acting like children.
Pete Hornberger: And like children, they can't be reasoned with. You
  just put a little whiskey in their juice bottle and wait for sleep
  to save you.
Liz Lemon: That won't work. Jenna is immune to whiskey, and Tracy is
  afraid of juice.

Jack Donaghy: The automotive company was ran by white morons who were
  out of touch with America. We're G.E., dammit. We're making a
  giant, shoddy microwave.

Jack Donaghy: Lemon, let me tell you a little story. It was 1994, and
  I was ice climbing when I fell into a crevasse and hurt my leg.
  There was only one way out, so fighting every natural instinct I
  have, I did the thing I hated the most. I climbed down into the
  darkness. And when I came back to camp, I went to the person who
  cut my line and said, "Connie Chung, you saved my life."

Tracy Jordan: Oh yeah, there's a garbage bag in the hall with a reef
  shark in it. Just put him in the tub with a reef.

Jenna Maroney: I didn't give up when Eric Roberts abandoned me in the
  desert and I won't now.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Jack Gets in the Game (#2.2)}
Kenneth Parcell: [to Tracy's recently estranged wife] I'm a real good
  sex person. I do it all the different ways.

Devon Banks: I'm gonna make your heart *explode*

Jenna Maroney: Me want food!

Devon Banks: [knowing Jack can't eat meat on account of his heart
  condition] Here. Why don't you take some of my steak. I could never
  eat this much meat.
Jack Donaghy: [knowing Banks is trying to pass himself off as
  straight] That's not what I hear. [laughs]

Announcer: Josh to the stage for "Illeana Douglas Talk Show".


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Jack Meets Dennis (#1.6)}
Jack: What is your contingency plan for a crap storm of this
  magnitude?

Liz Lemon: Okay, very funny. You bought a pager from Dennis. Will you
  take it off now, please?
Jack: Oh, I can't. I'm expecting a call from 1983.

Jack: Lemon, what tragedy happened in your life that you insist upon
  punishing yourself with all this... mediocrity?

Tracy Jordan: Did you see this? It's horrible! They're printing libel
  about me again. Libel, Liz Lemon!
Liz Lemon: Oh..."Normal"! How... dare they?
Tracy Jordan: That's what I'm saying! That's character assassination!
  That's not normal! It only looks like I'm walking out of a
  Starbucks, when actually I'm doing the robot going backwards INTO a
  Starbucks! And I don't even know whose dog that is! Yes, I steal
  dogs.
Liz Lemon: What is the problem?
Tracy Jordan: I can't be normal. If I'm normal, I'm boring. If I'm
  boring, I'm not a movie star. If I'm not a movie star, I'm poor!
  And poor people can't afford to pay back the $75,000 in cash they
  owe Quincy Jones! [rest of room just stares, nonplused; Tracy
  indignantly does the robot backward out the door]
Liz Lemon: Wow. Talkin' to that guy is like lookin' in a mirror, huh?

Jenna Maroney: How's the sex?
Liz Lemon: Fast and only on Saturdays. It's perfect.

Liz Lemon: Maybe the musical guest can do some extra songs this week.
  Who is it?
Pete Hornberger: James Blunt!
Liz Lemon: Ugh.

Dennis Duffy: Technology is cyclical.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Jack the Writer (#1.4)}
Tracy Jordan: But I want you to know something... You and me, it's
  not gonna be a one-way street. Cos I dont believe in one-way
  streets. Not between people, and not while I'm driving.
Kenneth: Oh, okay.
Tracy Jordan: So here's some advice I wish I would have got when I
  was your age... Live every week, like it's shark week.

Tracy Jordan: ...but what did I tell you was the secret to havin' a
  good marriage and keepin' it together, Kenneth?
Kenneth Parcell: Be a good listener, a giver of gifts and work that
  va-jay-jay.
Tracy Jordan: That's my boyeee!

Jack Donaghy: Beep, beep! Ribby, ribby!

Tracy Jordan: You and me... it's not gonna to be a one-way street.
  'Cause I don't believe in one-way streets. Not between people and
  not while I'm driving.
Kenneth Parcell: Oh... okay.
Tracy Jordan: So, here's some advice I wish I woulda got when I was
  your age: Live every week like it's Shark Week.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Jack-Tor (#1.5)}
Liz Lemon: Tracy took advantage of my white guilt, which is to be
  used only for good like overtipping and supporting Barack Obama.

Tracy Jordan: I can't read Liz Lemon. My shameful secret is out...
  now you know why I'm always running into the ladies bathroom.
  [walks into hallway]
Tracy Jordan: I can't read! I sign my name with an X! I once tried to
  make mashed potatoes with laundry detergent! I think I voted for
  Nader! NADER!

Liz Lemon: Okay, here's your pep talk. You're not an actor. You're
  Jack Donaghy, all right? So quit whining and NUT UP. You're right.
  If you can't do this, you ARE a failure. Josh can do this, and
  earlier today he ate a club sandwich with the toothpick still in
  it. Jenna can do this, and she was once engaged to David Blaine.
  Any dumb-dumb can act, Jack. So be a man and get it done.
Jack: If you were any other woman on earth, I would be turned on
  right now.

Jenna Maroney: I am gonna get back at them... using my sexuality.
Liz Lemon: Do you have any left?

Jenna Maroney: Yeah, but this is different because I know Jack
  Donaghy. I know what he likes.
Liz Lemon: Yeah. So now you just have to make yourself 10 years
  younger and Asian.

Stage Announcer: Jenna Maroney and Ghostface Killah to the stage for
  "Muffin Top".

Liz Lemon: I'm sorry, you're saying you want us to use the show to
  sell stuff?
Jack: Look, I-I know how this sounds.
Liz Lemon: No, come on, Jack, we're not doing that. We're not
  compromising the integrity of the show to sell...
Pete Hornberger: Wow, this is Diet Snapple?
Liz Lemon: I know, it tastes just like regular Snapple, doesn't it?
Pete Hornberger: You should try Plum-a-Granate. It's amazing.
Cerie: I only date guys who drink Snapple.

Pete: [about Tracy] So, first you thought he was illiterate, and now
  you think he's lazy? Liz, you *are* racist!
Liz Lemon: No, Tracy took advantage of my white guilt, which is
  supposed to be used only for good, like over-tipping and supporting
  Barack Obama.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Jackie Jormp-Jomp (#3.18)}
Tracy Jordan: Friendship and trust in the entourage is the most
  important thing. Like on that HBO show, John Adams.

Jenna Maroney: Oh, I can play dead. I watched my whole church group
  get eaten by a bear.

Jack Donaghy: You can't give up now. Did Jackie Jormp-Jomp give up
  when those vampires attacked Woodstox?

Jack Donaghy: Wait, you're dating one of the dancers?
Kenneth Parcell: Oh, no sir, I actually haven't spoken to her yet,
  but I have a long term plan to marry her and I wanted the company
  to be aware of my intentions.
Jack Donaghy: I see. I'll be sure to mention that at the next board
  meeting.
Kenneth Parcell: Thank you, sir. Also, I don't know if this is
  harassment, but someone at the Today Show made me eat an unripe
  banana in front of her.

Jenna Maroney: The Kids Choice Awards? Fine, I'll set aside my feud
  with Raven-Symone for one day... but she knows what she did.

Jenna Maroney: I'm prepared to slip a nipple if you think it will
  help.

Jack Donaghy: I'm going to Tupac you.
Jenna Maroney: OK, but I have to pee first.

Liz Lemon: Excuse me, Mr. Weinerslav...
Jeffrey Weinerslav: It's pronounced Wiener-slave.

Tracy Jordan: Heavy is the head that eats the crayons.

Jenna Maroney: Do you need a sex tape release? Because I've got a
  weird one. It's night vision and you can see that his buddy is
  robbing me.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Khonani (#4.18)}
Tracy Jordan: This is bad, because I can't change. I'm like a
  chameleon: always a lizard!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Kidney Now! (#3.22)}
Milton Green: A guy crying about a chicken and a baby? I thought this
  was a comedy show.

Tracy Jordan: I grew up with that guy, he was the baddest gangster in
  my class. We called him Mean Steve. But his real name was Stephen
  Killer.

Jack Donaghy: Ok, lets cut to the chase. MJ, you owe me. Who got you
  out of a 20 year exclusive performance contract at Seaworld? [Mary
  J. Blige rolls her eyes in defeat] Aiken, your cousin Kenneth
  Parcell already promised me you'd do this. [Clay Aiken rolls his
  eyes in disgust] And Elvis, or should I say Decland McManus,
  international art thief?
Elvis Costello: Ok Jack Donaghy, you tumbled me. We'll do it.

Liz Lemon: We sure had quite a year. [slaps Jack on the back]
Jack Donaghy: What are you talking about? It's May.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Klaus and Greta (#4.9)}
James Franco: My performance will be too provocative for America.

Jenna Maroney: I love jamba juice!

Tracy Jordan: Kenneth, your haircut is disrespectful to lesbians!

Liz Lemon: Well now you just have to hope that it's a girl.
Tracy Jordan: I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon, because I yelled, "Susan
  B. Anthony," at the moment of conception.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Larry King (#3.12)}
Liz Lemon: You want the truth, Kenneth, you want the truth?
Kenneth Parcell: I can't handle the truth!
Liz Lemon: There is an adult picture of me on that phone.
Kenneth Parcell: Adult? You mean like you're driving a car or wearing
  a suit?
Liz Lemon: It's a boobies picture, Kenneth, and I only kept it
  because for once they were both pointing in the same direction.

Elisa: It smells like dude in here.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter (#4.17)}
Jack Donaghy: [to Liz] This has nothing to do with our slight
  difference in gender.

Jack Donaghy: What are you wearing tonight?
Avery Jessup: The museum gala? Think slutty Grace Kelly.
Jack Donaghy: I'm picturing it right now.
[Liz walks in wearing sweats]
Jack Donaghy: And the exact opposite just walked in.
Avery Jessup: Tell Liz I said hi.

Jenna Maroney: I could go with you, be your wingman.
Liz Lemon: Oh, you wouldn't want to go there.
Jenna Maroney: Oh, it would be good acting research for me. I'm up
  for a role in National Lampoon's Van Wilder's Wingman,
  Incorporated.
Liz Lemon: I'm looking forward to not seeing that on a plane.

Jack Donaghy: Dating is like your haircut. Sometimes awkward
  triangles occur.
Liz Lemon: It feels like you've been saving that one.
Jack Donaghy: Obviously.

Toofer: I'm about to say two words a Harvard man would never say.
Liz Lemon: "I'm cool"? No, I can't let you be set up like that. Don't
  quit.
Toofer: I quit!

Nancy Donovan: There's a Lee Marvin marathon on Turner Classic
  tonight.
Jack Donaghy: I thought you said it wasn't going to get sexual.

Avery Jessup: I love this restaurant. This is one of the few places
  in New York with a veal tank.
Jack Donaghy: It tastes better when you pick your own.

Liz Lemon: Oh my God, I'm no better than Toofer. Or Lutz with his
  B.S. Inuit ancestry. Or you, whose dad was in the masons with Dave
  Garroway. I shouldn't be here.
Pete Hornberger: This is America. None of us are supposed to be here.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Let's Stay Together (#5.3)}
[Bookman criticizes Jack for the shortage of prominent black
  characters on NBC]
Jack Donaghy: Then perhaps you should watch Anthony Anderson on "Law
  And Order", now entering its twenty-first seas...
[Jonathan covers his mouth and whispers into his ear]
Jack Donaghy: [whispering] Cancelled? Why would we do that? It makes
  no sense!

Jack Donaghy: In a post-apocalyptic society, what possible use would
  they have for you?
Liz Lemon: Travelling bard.
Jack Donaghy: Radiation canary.

Tracy Jordan: I love cop shows. Personally, I can't wait for Law and
  Order to start up again. [Grizz whispers into Tracy's ear] What? It
  was a tentpole! A tentpole!

Jack Donaghy: What about Twofer?
Liz Lemon: I don't know if you've heard, but he went to Harvard.
Jack Donaghy: So we know he's smart and good at masturbation.
Liz Lemon: Yeah! [They high-five]

Regina Bookman: I'm at New York with some of my colleages. We have
  meetings on Wall Street, then we're taking the Sex and the City
  tour.
Rep. Rob Reiner: Magnolia Bakery? Sorry, hips.

Frank Rossitano: [On Liz's new nameplate, "El Tejon"] It means "the
  badger" in Spanish. I don't know who did it. [Liz looks at Frank's
  hat, which reads "I did it"]

Regina Bookman: [during a speech] The Future! And America! Now I may
  have lost my train of thought several minutes ago, but if I
  continue to talk like this, no one will notice. And when I stop,
  you will applaud my energy! Thank You!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Live Show (#5.4)}

  your panties...


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Ludachristmas (#2.9)}
[Liz's brother Mitch had an accident as a teenager and believes it's
  still 1985]
Jack Donaghy: Oh in his mind Reagan is still President?
Jack Donaghy: [to Mitch] You lucky bastard.

Colleen Donaghy: Jack, this coat isn't gonna take itself off.

Tracy Jordan: The holidays without drinkin' is rough. Turns out
  football is boring, my wife's sister ain't as cute as I though she
  was and I can not play the guitar.

Mitch Lemon: What's up? Do you like Wham? 'Cause, eh, I'm kinda like
  the George Michael of my school.

Liz Lemon: Nice to have some positive reinforcement, isn't it?
Jack Donaghy: Well, it's only positive reinforcement when they say it
  to you. In my case they're just stating the facts. I do look like
  the Arrow shirt man, I did lace up my skates professionally and I
  did do a fabulous job finishing my muffin.

Jack Donaghy: See mother, not all species eat their young.

Jack Donaghy: [Reaching for the restaurant check] Now, Dick, let me
  get...
Dick Lemon: Ahh-ah-ah Jack, it's on me. Wouldn't be a Lemon party
  without old Dick!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {MILF Island (#2.11)}
Kenneth Parcell: I thought we were friends!
Liz Lemon, Deborah: [in unison with MILF Island, playing in the
  background] I didn't come here to make friends! I came here to be
  number one!

Liz Lemon: This place can eat my poo.

Jack Donaghy: You know if you Google the phrase 'class-A moron' my
  name pops first now, so... step aside Randy Quaid.

Kenneth Parcell: Miss Lemon. Your eyes look like my uncle's after he
  would drink from the air conditioner.

Jack Donaghy: So you have seen the show, and why shouldn't you? It
  has sex, lies, puberty, betrayal, relay races, MILF Island reflects
  the drama of the human experience and isn't that the essence of
  art?


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Mamma Mia (#3.21)}
Liz Lemon: Look, Jack, I don't have a lot of personal life
  experience, but if I have learned anything from my Sims family...
  when a child doesn't see his father enough, he starts to jump up
  and down, and then his mood level will drop until he pees himself.
Jack Donaghy: Why don't I have any other friends?

Liz Lemon: Wow, okay what about this? Maybe Donald is Tracy's son,
  because maybe Tracy is 60.
Pete Hornberger: No, that's ridiculous.
Liz Lemon: Think about it, he can't rap, he has diabetes, a lot of
  his friends are dead.

Lenny Wosniak: I gave my gun to my pastor, you know, in case I get
  the old "gloomies" again.

Jack: You know what family means to me Lemon? Resentment. Guilt.
  Anger. Easter egg hunts that turn into knife fights.

Jenna Maroney: [to writers] And you know who else loves
  "Dealbreaker"? Bret Michaels. We have the same publicist, and she
  said he'd love to come here and dress in the same outfit and do it
  with me... and also, he wants to be on the show.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning (#5.12)}
Jack Donaghy: Shh. Shh, Lemon, it's okay. As I begin phase two of my
  Jack Attack on Kabletown, I've been doing some research. Do you
  know what the most successful reality events of the past five years
  are? Celebrity benefits for natural disasters. The viewership is
  huge.

Liz Lemon: You're getting an island?
Tracy Jordan: Every crazy A-lister owns an island. Nicolas Cage,
  Celine Dion, Charles Widmore...


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Pilot (#1.1)}
Jack: Are you drunk?
Liz Lemon: [drunk] Yessss!

Tracy Jordan: Excuse me, where's the manager? I'm from the goverment
  and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets!

Tracy Jordan: Affirmative action was designed to keep women and
  minorities in competition with each other to distract us while
  white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.

Tracy Jordan: You know how pissed off I was when U.S. Weekly said
  that I was on crack? That's racist! I'm not on crack - I'm
  straight-up mentally ill!

Jack: Alfredo's, 2 PM.
Liz Lemon: I'm not dressed for that.
Jack: You're dressed for Burger King. Should we make it Burger King?

Liz Lemon: Where's Gary?
Jack: [Kicks down door and enters room] Gary's dead. I'm Jack
  Donaghy. New VP of development for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart.
Pete: Oh, we own Kmart now?
Jack: No. So why are you dressed like we do?

Liz Lemon: [Referencing Tracy Jordan] Isn't he umm... crazy?

Tracy Jordan: [Running through traffic in nothing but tighty whities,
  screaming] I am a Jedi! I am a Jedi!

Jack: [to Liz] I like you. You have the boldness of a much younger
  woman.

Pete: Okay, marry, kill: Oprah, bin Laden, and Jenna.
Liz Lemon: What did I tell you about playing that game with people in
  the room?
Jenna Maroney: No Liz, it's okay.
Frank: Okay, well I'd marry Oprah, for the money. I do bin Laden for
  revenge and then his own people would kill him. And I'd kill Jenna.

Tracy Jordan: Affirmative action was designed to keep women and
  minorities in competition with each other to distract us, while
  white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.

Toufer: [Complaining to Liz] Surely our massive conglomerate parent
  company could spring for a samovar of coffee.
Frank: Yeah, or, like, a big coffee dispenser!
Toufer: [Condescendingly] That's what a samovar is.
Frank: Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?
[Toofer just stares at Frank]

Jack: [as an assistant holds up a Post-It note] Ah, I'll call her
  back. Is she at the White House line? [assistant nods] Great. [ &
  holds up 2nd note] Tell them I need a 4am tee-off time [3rd note]
  Uh, five inches, but it's thick.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Plan B (#5.18)}
Liz Lemon: Kenneth! you beautiful goon! He's not in Africa; he's
  somewhere in the delivery zone of Federici's Pizza! We can find him
  and bring him back here, and no more forced hiatus!
Kenneth Parcell: I did it! I saved the show! Now I won't have to go
  to News.
Liz Lemon: And I won't have to be the world's worst hooker!
Liz Lemon: [scene changes to an alley where Liz is leaning into a car
  wearing a sweatshirt and a blue wig:] You wanna party? It's $500
  for kissing and $10,000 for snuggling. End of list.

Aaron Sorkin: [Liz is in a reception area waiting to meet with Nick
  Lachey about a writing job] You here for the "Sing-Off" gig?
Liz Lemon: Yeah. Do I know you?
Aaron Sorkin: You know my work. Walk with me.
[Sorkin stands up and Liz follows]
Aaron Sorkin: I'm Aaron Sorkin. "The West Wing," A Few Good Men, The
  Social Network.
Liz Lemon: "Studio 60"?
Aaron Sorkin: Shut up.
Aaron Sorkin: Do you know Nick Lachey? I hear he doesn't even let you
  sit in the meeting; he just screams at you to see how you react.
Liz Lemon: Wait, you're not really applying for this job, are you?
Aaron Sorkin: 'Course I am. You've got to take work where you find
  it, especially now. Our craft is dying while people are playing
  "Angry Birds" and poking each other on Facebook. What is poking
  anyway? Why won't anybody do it to me? I'm cool.
Liz Lemon: So it's really that bad out there. I mean, you're Aaron
  Sorkin. Speaking of "Angry Birds," do you know how to beat 11-4?
  It's just a red guy and a green guy.
Aaron Sorkin: The key is do not use the green guy as a boomerang.
Liz Lemon: Did we just go in a circle?
Aaron Sorkin: Listen, lady - a gender I write extremely well if the
  story calls for it - this is serious. We make horse buggies. The
  first Model T just rolled into town.
Liz Lemon: We're dinosaurs.
Aaron Sorkin: We don't need two metaphors. That's bad writing. Not
  that it matters.
Assistant: Mr. Sorkin? Mr. Lachey will see you now.
Aaron Sorkin: [Sorkin walks into the office] Mr. Lachey. Huge fan!
  Huge fan. I have all your albums.

  accident so that I can have it.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Retreat to Move Forward (#3.9)}
Tracy Jordan: So how bad is diabetes, really?
Dr. Leo Spaceman: Quite serious. If left untreated you could lose a
  foot.
Tracy Jordan: Could I replace it with a wheel, like Rosie from the
  Jetsons?
Dr. Leo Spaceman: I suppose. But then you'd have to register as a
  motor vehicle.

Kenneth Parcell: You can't eat candy if you have diabetes.
Tracy Jordan: There's no link between diabetes and diet. That's a
  white myth, Ken; like Larry Bird or Colorado.

Kenneth Parcell: What can I do for you, Miss... Jimplin?
Jenna Maroney: [using the method to prepair for her Janis Joplin
  role] Well according to my Wikipedia page, I'm gonna need some
  Cherry juice, Buttermilk and Tequila to make my signature Janice
  Joplin cocktail: the Frank-schlong.

Liz Lemon: [holds up two halves of a lego train] Sorry, I dropped it
  when I pretended it was my penis. [mechanical voice] Robot-penis.

Toofer: You know, there's a conspiracy theory that, after the civil
  war, the U.S. government spread false information about diabetes to
  keep the newly-freed slaves sluggish and docile, which is why, to
  this date, most African Americans don't understand that diabetes is
  caused by sleeping on your back.

Improviser: [Reading a slip of paper drawn from a hat] The audience
  suggestion is "Sling Blade and Oprah on a date."
Liz Lemon: [In a Sling Blade voice while pretending to eat] I sure do
  like dem french-fried potaters.
Jenna Maroney: No you don't, Oprah.

  after being offered a $50 gift card to Outback Steak House trance-
  like- I want to go to there.

Liz Lemon: Even Rob Sussman hated me? He was the first gay guy I ever
  kissed.

Jessica Speyer: [Jack has been mistaken for Larry Braverman and goes
  with the flow] I hate the way we ended, Larry. I am so, so sorry
  for what happened.
Jack Donaghy: Well, I forgive you... [glances at her nametag]...
  Jessica.
Jessica Speyer: Really? Even for...
Jack Donaghy: Especially for that.
Jessica Speyer: Say what you said to me that night at the lake.
Jack Donaghy: [reaches over to touch her face] No.

Jenna Maroney: [bursting into Tracey's dressing room] Kenneth is a
  monster!
Tracy Jordan: We have to stop him!

Kenneth Parcell: [drying his tears] I'm so sorry, Miss Maroney.
Jenna Maroney: No, keep crying. I want you to feel this so you never
  make this mistake again.

Jack Donaghy: We all know that Liz Lemon has her faults, but no one's
  perfect. I mean, I'm certainly not perfect.
Keith: [objections from the people in the audience] Don't say that
  Braverman!
Rob Sussman: You're more than perfect.

Rosemary: Help me Liz Lemon! You're my only hope!

Jack: Never go with a hippie to a second location.

Tracy Jordan: [to his psychiatrist] Who's crazier,me or Ann Curry?

Tracy Jordan: Tracy Jordan: I don't need the therapy! I'm just
  mentally ill!

Jack: [about Rosemary] Fire her. And don't ever make me talk to a
  woman that old again.

Liz Lemon: [entering Rosemary's neighborhood] Is that guy carrying a
  gun?
Rosemary: Yeah, but don't worry, he's not a cop.

Liz Lemon: Alright, I need my job back but this is not crawling, this
  is proud begging like those kids that dance on the subway.
Jack: Of course you can have your job back, Lemon.
Liz Lemon: Oh thank god! It was terrible. I went to her apartment. I
  don't think she has a toilet! I saw my future, Jack.
Jack: Never go with a hippie to a second location. [hands Lemon a
  glass of wine]
Liz Lemon: [sighs] I can't end up like that. I have gotta make money
  and save it. And I have to do that thing that rich people do where
  they turn money into *more* money. Can you teach me how to do that?
Jack: With my eyes closed.
Liz Lemon: Oh good, because I want to send Rosemary $400 a month
  for... forever.
Jack: You should, that woman is unemployable.
Liz Lemon: Rosemary said that women become obsolete in this business
  when there's no one left that wants to see them naked.
Jack: You make enough money, you can pay people to look at you naked.
[raises glass]
Jack: To the future, Lemon. Oh, and by the way, GE has a problem with
  the dog penis sketch.
Liz Lemon: [they both take a sip, Lemon hands her glass back to Jack]
  I'll change it.
[turns to leave, Jack pours the remainder of her wine into his glass]
Liz Lemon: [off screen] Hey, what about cat penises?

Tracy Jordan: Who's crazier? Me or Ann Curry?

Jack: Where do you invest your money, Liz?
Liz Lemon: I have, like, twelve grand in checking...
Jack: Are you an immigrant?

Tracy's Father: Tracy, don't stare directly at the sun. It'll make
  you crazy.
Tracy Jordan: You're not my dad!

Jack: [Pretending to be Tracy's dad] Lady, just because I'm an
  ignorant black man and you paid me a nickel to bust up your
  chifforobe, doesn't give you the right to call me ridiculous just
  'cause I'm proud of my son.

Liz Lemon: [stampedes into the writers' desk after finding out that
  her sandwich is missing, with a statue in her hand] Where's my
  sandwich?
Tracy Jordan: Lutz made us do it!
Lutz: No it was Frank.
Frank: Lie! It was you! [the three of them begin to overlap]
Kenneth Parcell: Stop it! This is all my fault, Miss Lemon, because I
  let it happen. And the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil
  is for a good man to do nothing.
Tracy Jordan: Please aks my permission before you quote me, Kenneth.
Liz Lemon: I don't know how, but you're gonna get me another
  sandwich. Or I'm gonna cut your face up so bad you'll have a chin!
  [shouting] You'll all have chins!

Frank: Hey, can you make the teamsters tell us where they make those
  sandwiches?
Jack Donaghy: Only if you beat them at a drinking contest. It's in

# "30 Rock" (2006) {Season 4 (#4.1)}
Jack: We'll trick those race card lovin' wide-loads into watching
  your lefty homoerotic propaganda hour yet.
Liz Lemon: You just don't like anybody, do you.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Secret Santa (#4.8)}
Jack Donaghy: I've been finger tagged, Lemon.
Liz Lemon: Was it down by the subway entrance because I saw a gangly
  looking kid down there?

Toofer: Kenneth is doing a Secret Santa fun swap thing!
Frank Rossitano: Urgh, he takes the 2 worst parts of Christmas,
  giving and rules and combines them!
Kenneth Parcell: [Flash back] And then the person with the highest
  number gives the smallest gift to the tallest person and if they
  want to switch they cannot unless they do then everyone puts their
  head down except the murderer - oh wait that's not right.
Frank Rossitano: The whole thing was so confusing I ended up getting
  my crappy gift back, like I need 2 copies of over 60 Vixens

Danny Baker: I'm sorry, are you being sarcastic? Canadians have a
  hard time recognizing it 'cause we don't have a big Jewish
  population.

Liz Lemon: Nope, do not put a hyphen in YouFace. There are definitely
  faces here, but they are not being treated with respect.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Secrets and Lies (#2.8)}
Celeste Cunningham: I should never have listened to a woman who tapes
  her bra together.
Jack: Lemon.

Celeste Cunningham: I like your necklace.
Liz Lemon: Oh, thank, it's actually a rape whistle, but the whistle
  part fell off and I just liked how it looked, so I kept it...

Liz Lemon: Well, I will leave you to it.
Celeste Cunningham: 'It' meaning 'business'.
Liz Lemon: Of course. I call the movie 'Risky Business' 'Risky It'
  because it means business. Lemon out.

Josh Girard: [laughs] You're lame thing is on his pants!

Tracy Jordan: I do not want to disappoint my Japanese public,
  especially Godzilla. HAHAHAHA! Just kidding. I know he doesn't care
  what humans do.

Jack: I like when a woman has ambition. It's like seeing a dog
  wearing clothes.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {SeinfeldVision (#2.1)}
Jack: I'm back Lemon. I've had the most productive summer of my life.
Liz Lemon: Me Too!
Jack: All of my summer replacement shows were big hits. America's
  Next Top Pirate, Are You Stronger Than a Dog, MILF Island.
Liz Lemon: Milf Island?
Jack: Twentyfive super hot moms. Fifty eighth grade boys. No rules.
Liz Lemon: Oh yeah. Didn't one of those women turn out to be a
  prostitute?
Jack: That doesn't mean she's not a wonderful, caring milf.

[Jerry Seinfeld has been digitally inserted in an episode of
  "Heroes"]
Jerry Seinfeld: [talking to Ando and Hiro on the phone] Save the
  cheerleader, save the world!
Ando Masahashi: [to Hiro, in Japanese] Save the cheerleader, save the
  world.
Jerry Seinfeld: [annoyed] Yeah, that's what I said!

Liz Lemon: I'm telling you, this is my year. I feel like the show's
  going to be great and I'm very positive that I'm going to meet
  someone else.
Jack: Women your age are more likely to be mauled at the zoo than get
  married.

Jack: [referring to Jenna's weight gain] She needs to lose 30 pounds
  or gain 60. Anything in between has no place in television.
Liz Lemon: I can't believe I missed you.

Jerry Seinfeld: [Lemon is wearing a wedding dress] Well, well, well.
  So you called that boyfriend.
Liz Lemon: Yes I did.
Jerry Seinfeld: And it went well?
Liz Lemon: No. It didn't, Jer. A woman answered.
Jerry Seinfeld: Another woman already? What did you say to her?
Liz Lemon: [starts breaking down] I did a fake survey!
Jerry Seinfeld: [raises voice in typical Seinfeld manner] You did the
  fake survey?
Liz Lemon: [raises voice too] I know. I'm not over it! And now I'm
  wearing this. What is the deal with my life?
Jerry Seinfeld: Are you imitating me?
Liz Lemon: No! This is what I sound like when I cry!
Jerry Seinfeld: I think I'm a little insulted.
Liz Lemon: You're insulted? I'm crying!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Somebody to Love (#2.6)}
Tracy Jordan: Stop eating people's old French fries, pigeon. Have
  some self respect! Don't you know you can fly?

Tracy Jordan: Tell her you want her to donate her body to science and
  you're science.

Liz Lemon: Didn't you just get a haircut two days ago?
Jack Donaghy: I get my hair cut every two days. After all, your hair
  is your headsuit. I'm going to a party tonight honoring Robert
  Novack, it's being thrown by John McCain and Jack Bauer.
Liz Lemon: Em, I don't think he's real.
Jack Donaghy: [laughs] I assure you, Lemon, John McCain is very real.
  I have to look perfect. When it comes to hair, no one is more
  bitchy than conservative males.

Jack Donaghy: [to Celeste] You know, I thought you made love like an
  ugly girl. So present, so grateful.

Jack Donaghy: Tracy, I don't believe in soulmates and I worked to
  hard to get where I am to sacrifice it for some woman. I don't care
  if she is beautiful, brilliant and she does it like her father's a
  minister.

Tracy Jordan: Tell her that you want your privates and her privates
  to do a high five.

Tracy Jordan: Tell her, her butt looks like an apple and you want to
  take a bite.

Raheem Haddad: America's government shocked my nuts.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {St. Valentine's Day (#3.11)}
[Jack is in a confession booth, trying to shock the priest]
Jack Donaghy: I once claimed "I am God" during a deposition.

Elisa: You know what your problem is, Jack? You intellectualize
  everything with your big head!
Jack Donaghy: Well, you have big boobs!
Elisa: Which you'll never touch again!
Jack Donaghy: [sotto voce] This conversation has taken an unfortunate
  turn.

Jack Donaghy: Elisa is deeply religious.
Liz Lemon: If I had those knockers, I'd be thanking God too.

Dr. Drew Baird: Ok, I feel like I should do the right thing here and
  tell you that your breast has fallen out of your blouse and I can
  see all of it.
Liz Lemon: [glances down] Okay, well, I guess we just [nervous
  chuckle] jumped ahead to date four. [quietly] It's not the good
  one, either.

Elisa: You blew it, Jack. And now you will never see the crazy
  underwears I have on.

Elisa: Maybe this is God telling me we do not belong together. Maybe
  this is a sign.
Jack Donaghy: [his phone chimes] Look - my driver just pulled up.
  *That's* a sign. God wants us to leave here, get a good meal, and
  go to town on each other.
Elisa: [she slaps him] How dare you say something like that so close
  to the statue of Santa Lucia, the patron saint of judgmental
  statues!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Stone Mountain (#4.3)}
Jenna Maroney: [Jenna has followed the boys into the mensroom] Oh
  wow, they painted the ceiling in here!

Jack Donaghy: Good God Lemon, your breathe... When did you find time
  to eat a diaper that you found on the beach?

Jack Donaghy: We're going to find the perfect person for the show
  down here [in Georgia] . Someone who represents the *Real America*.
Liz Lemon: Jack, for the 80th time, no part of America is more
  American than any other part.
Jack Donaghy: You are wrong. Small towns are where you see the
  kindness and goodness and courage of everyday Americans. The folks
  who are teaching our kids, running our prisons, growing our
  cigarettes. People who are still living by core American values.
Liz Lemon: There are plenty of core American values in New York. But
  there are not restaurants called "Fatty Fat Sandwich Ranch." Turn
  here! Turn here!

Liz Lemon: I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to
  sit in peace and eat a sandwich.
Jack Donaghy: How surprising that your world view is food-based.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Subway Hero (#2.12)}
Liz Lemon: If reality TV has taught us anything, it's that you can't
  keep people with no shame down.

Dennis Duffy: I knew that girl was eighteen. She told me that her
  last boyfriend was Asian, and that crap doesn't start until
  college.

Jack Donaghy: [about Richard Nixon] God bless that wiretapping
  bastard!

Tracy Jordan: My fellow Blackmericans!

Jack: Save it Liz, I booked the 911 Bird. Winston here saved his
  owner by dialing 911 and yelling fire only because he didn't know
  the word for rape.

Michael Bloomberg: For his exceptional courage, the City of New York
  bestows the Bronze Medallion on Dennis Duffy.
Dennis Duffy: Thank you Mayor Bloomberger. I accept this honor on
  behalf of every - [shouts] Stern Rules! Baba Booey!

Jack Donaghy: ...let me ask you a question, Kenneth. If Mr. Bright
  here told you to vote Republican, would you do it?
Kenneth Parcell: Oh, uh, no, sir. I don't vote Republican or
  Democrat. Choosing is a sin, so I always just write in the Lord's
  name!
Jack Donaghy: That's Republican. We count those.

Bucky Bright: [Kenneth leads retired 50's TV writer Bucky Bright to
  the writers' room] We used to call this the "Jew room".

Jack: Jonathan's going to round up all the cool Republican
  celebrities.
Liz Lemon: [laughs] Like who, Chuck Norris?
Jack: No, C-No and I had a falling out after I switched to another
  dojo.

Frank Rossitano: Wow. I never would have had the guts to do what that
  dude did.
Liz Lemon: You don't know that.
Frank Rossitano: I do know. I've watched seven different people die
  in subway stations.

Jack Donaghy: Dot com, this need you have to be the smartest guy in
  the room is... off putting.
Dot Com: I guess that's why I'm still single. [walks off downtrodden]

Bucky Bright: Back then we didn't have pages, you know. We had what
  we called 'sandwich girls'.
Kenneth Parcell: Oh, because they got you sandwiches?
Bucky Bright: No, no, no, two guys 'd get... Hey, my old dressing
  room.

Tracy Jordan: Now if you'll excuse me, Nixon asked me to take some
  stuff out of his Wikipedia page. [holds up a screwdriver]

Bucky Bright: [about Lemon] Well that's one mouthy sandwich girl,
  isn't it?

Kenneth Parcell: I don't choose Democrat or Republican because
  choosing is a sin, so I just write in the Lord's name.
Jack: That's Republican; we count those.

Bucky Bright: [Kenneth leads retired 50's TV personality Bucky Bright
  to the writers' room] We used to call this the "Jew room".

Tracy Jordan: My genius is come alive... like toys when your back is
  turned.

Liz Lemon: Hey nerds! Guess who's got 2 thumbs, speaks limited
  French, and hasn't cried once today? This moi!

Tracy Jordan: Which of my hobbies should I indulge first...
  videogames or pornography?

Tracy Jordan: My genius will not be denied. I'm like Mozart. and
  you're like that guy who was always jealous of Mozart.
Frank Rossitano: Salieri?
Tracy Jordan: No thank you. I already ate.

Jack Donaghy: Mr Geiss, I'm so sorry, I just found out you're here.
  I'd have my assistant sit on his naughty stool if he didn't love it
  so much.

Jack Donaghy: When will this be made public, sir? I want my mother to
  know before she dies so goes to her grave a defeated woman.

Jack Donaghy: Why do I smell self-tanning cream and teeth
  whitener?... Banks!

Liz Lemon: I'm feeling pretty drunk.
Jack Donaghy: Well, it's business drunk, it's like rich drunk. Either
  way, it's legal to drive.

Devon Banks: [to Jack] There is no meeting today. See I convinced the
  board to have an emergency meeting last night. I tried to call you,
  but not on the phone, so you may not have heard me.

Liz Lemon: To get through it I pretended he was a sandwich.

Tracy Jordan: I need to clear my thoughtcicles.

Tracy Jordan: I was born to design a video game where characters get
  weird with each other for golden points. My genius will not be
  denied.

Jack Donaghy: Couldn't you just inject something right into his
  heart?
Dr. Leo Spaceman: I'd love to, but we have no way of knowing where
  the heart is. See, every human is different.

Dr. Leo Spaceman: Is it 411 or 911? [Dials three numbers] New York.
  Uhhh... Diabetes repair, I guess?


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Sun Tea (#4.6)}
Dr. Leo Spaceman: Now this is surgery, so don't eat anything before
  you come in. Because I'll have a big breakfast waiting for you.

Frank Rossitano: Hey, Tracy! Now you can tell me your filthy strip
  club story.
Tracy Jordan: Frank, I'm gonna have a daughter and I would never tell
  that story. It's demeaning to women. Especially if they had their
  boobies sneezed on by a tiger.

Jack Donaghy: Tracy Jr. made you an acrostic.
Tracy Jordan: Well I hope he makes me an 'across helmet so I don't
  get hurt playin' 'across.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Aftermath (#1.2)}
Liz Lemon: I thought Tracy was getting here at noon.
Jack: Movie stars move at their own pace, Liz. We have to accommodate
  him.
Liz Lemon: Yeah, well, a lot of people are still upset about Tracy
  joining the show.
Jack: Well, that's not my problem. I have other things on my plate.
  You hear about that chemical factory explosion outside of Colorado
  Springs?
Liz Lemon: No...
Jack: Good.

Tracy Jordan: [Recording new promos for The Girlie Show] Hi, I'm
  Tracy Jordan, and I'm bringing the black back to NBC. And I'm proud
  as a peacork, baby.
Liz Lemon: That's great Tracy but it's peacock.
Tracy Jordan: What I say?
Liz Lemon: Peacork.
Tracy Jordan: Peacock. Think peaCOCK. Right, Jenna?
Stage Manager: In 3, 2...
Tracy Jordan: Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm bringing the black back
  to NBC. And I'm proud as a peaCOCK, baby.
Liz Lemon: Okay. That time I think you may have hit it a little bit
  too hard. Also can you throw Jenna's name in there for me?
Stage Manager: In 3, 2...
Tracy Jordan: Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm bringing the black back
  to NBC. Right, Jenna Malvangany?
Liz Lemon: Maroney, rhymes with baloney.
Stage Manager: In 3, 2...
Tracy Jordan: Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm bringing the black back
  to NBC. And I'm proud as a peacock. Right, my baloney?
Liz Lemon: Nope.
Stage Manager: In 3, 2...
Tracy Jordan: Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan. I'm black NBC. Very proud, like
  peacocks. Right, Janet? [end of take] I think we got it! I think we
  got it!
Jack: Yep, I think we did.

Liz Lemon: Tracy has... mental health issues.
Jenna Maroney: He bit Dakota Fanning on the face!
Liz Lemon: When you hear his versions she was kind of asking for it.

Tracy Jordan: So I said, 'Rick, this chick's got a Adam's apple.' And
  Rick said to me, I'll never forget this, he said, 'Freaky-deekies
  need love too... Freaky-deekies need. love. too.'

Tracy Jordan: You don't have to thank me, Lemon. We're a team now.
  Like Batman and Robin. Like chicken, and a chicken container.

Tracy Jordan: [answering phone] Yo!
Josh Girard: [impersonating Jack Donaghy] Tracy. It's Jack Donaghy. I
  hear we have a problem with Josh Girard.
Tracy Jordan: Damn right! Keeps impersonating me! Makin' me into a
  caricature!
Josh Girard: Well, I would take care of this if I could. But it's
  tricky. You see, Josh's father's an assassin with the Russian
  mafia. They call him "El Matador."
Tracy Jordan: Whoooa. Those dudes are crazy. Forget it. I don't need
  any of that noise.
Josh Girard: It happies me. To hear you say that. For being so
  understanding, I'm sending you our new, super-top-secret invisible
  motorcycle.
Tracy Jordan: For reals?
Josh Girard: [laughs] For realsies. Now if you'll excuse me, I need
  to see adoctor. I keep pooping during sex.

Jack: My mother wanted to send me to Vietnam to make a man out of me.
Kenneth: Oh.
Jack: I was twelve.

Dr. Leo Spaceman: [answering phone] This is Dr. Leo Spaceman.
Liz Lemon: [confused] Oh, hi. I'm sorry, I got this number under
  fertility in the Writers Guild Health Manual?
Dr. Leo Spaceman: I'm also listed under meth addiction and child
  psychiatry. So, what can I help you with? I should start by saying
  that I can't personally help you conceive. Something happened to me
  while scuba diving.

Jack: Business doesn't get me down. Business gets me off.

Liz Lemon: This is your fault, nerd. Jack is going to kill me, then
  he's going to kill you, and then he's going to fold us into a pizza
  and eat it.

Tracy Jordan: This is untoward! This is NOT TOWARD!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Break-Up (#1.8)}
Jack: Guess where I was last night?
Liz Lemon: Mark Foley's sleepover party?

Dennis Duffy: I'm moving into my new apartment so I've got one last
  thing to say to you and I'll be out of your life forever. [reading
  from written letter] Dear Liz Lemon: While other women have bigger
  boobs than you, no other woman has as big a heart. When I saw you
  getting ready to go out and get nailed by a bunch of guys last
  night, I knew for sure it was over between us, and for the first
  time since the '86 World Series, I cried... I cried like a big,
  dumb homo. And if it was up to me, we'd be together forever. But
  there's a new thing called "women's liberation", which gives you
  women the right to choose and you have chosen to abort me, and that
  I must live with. So tonight, when you arrive home, I'll be gone. I
  officially renounce my squatter's rights.

Tracy Jordan: I want to hold a mirror up to society and then win
  world record for biggest mirror.

Jenna Maroney: That guy wanted to buy you a drink!
Liz Lemon: Really? But I already have a drink. Do you think he'd buy
  me mozzarella sticks?

Jenna Maroney: Do you think those guys work on Wall Street?
Liz Lemon: Yeah. I think they're from the firm Date Rape, Cokington,
  Cheeseball and Jag.

Tracy Jordan: Sneaky Taiwanese tranny who stole my watch

Jack Donaghy: I've arranged for one of Tracy's childhood idols to
  reach out to him.
Tracy Jordan: Hello?
Jack Donaghy: Tracy, this is Jack, I have someone here who wants to
  speak with you.
Rick: Tracy, this is Bill Cosby...
Liz Lemon: [whispering] Really? This is your strategy?
Jack Donaghy: [whispering and smiling] I heard him do this at a
  party!
Rick: ...I want you to come back to the TGS for the people who like
  the jokes and the things.
Tracy Jordan: Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin' on the phone
  wit' me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette!
Rick: I think you're confusing me with someone else.
Tracy Jordan: 1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the
  droopy eye!
Rick: I'm the guy... with the pudding...
Tracy Jordan: Don't try to tell me what to do! Heathcliffe Huxtable,
  wit' yo' light-ass kids! Jack! Why would you make me talk to this
  man?
Jack Donaghy: Tracy, wait! [ Deepens voice slightly. ] Tracy this is
  Billy Dee Williams, I just wanna say I love your work, it's very
  smooth... [Lemon groans and walks out]

Jack Donaghy: God, this is like dating Katie Couric all over again.

Tracy Jordan: I don't have a daughter.
Jack Donaghy: [puts his arm around Tracy] Let's have casting session
  on Monday.

Tracy Jordan: [knocks on Jack's door]
Jack Donaghy: Come on in, Tracy.
Tracy Jordan: Yo, is this about that little redheaded intern? 'Cause
  she *asked* me to take it out.

Liz Lemon: [bursts into Jack's office] Oh, hey - false alarm! It
  turns out she *asked* him to take it out.

Jack Donaghy: Liz, all the VPs will be angling to golf with Don
  Geiss, but my partner will be Tracy Jordan, his grandchildren's
  favorite movie star. Geiss will absolutely choose us, and that's a
  big deal because being in a foursome with this man can change your
  life.
Liz Lemon: You might want to rephrase that.

Liz Lemon: Hey, Frank, wake up! You're not allowed to sleep through
  the topical meeting.

Pete Hornberger: Okay, the van to take you up to Connecticut will be
  leaving at noon, and once you get up to the golf course you're be
  working in pairs... Okay, have fun; don't get drunk.

Kenneth Parcell: I just don't want to disgrace the peacock.
Pete Hornberger: Oh, Kenneth. If you're worried about disgracing the
  National Broadcasting Company, you're too late.

Kenneth Parcell: Doggone it, Grace; I just don't know myself around
  you.

Kenneth Parcell: Hello, gentlemen. Welcome to the 9th Annual Cure
  Diabetes Now Golf Tournament.
Jack Donaghy: Has Don Geiss arrived yet?
Kenneth Parcell: No, sir, but if you'd like, we could work out a
  signal so I could let you know when he does arrive, like... [coos
  like a bird]
Jack Donaghy: That won't be necessary.
Kenneth Parcell: [quietly] I'll probably just do it anyway.

[Liz comes upon Greta's box of kittens]
Liz Lemon: [excitedly] Look at these guys!
Greta Johanssen: Yeah, they like you! They're very good at sensing
  debilitating loneliness in a person.

Liz Lemon: We need to fire Lutz.
Pete Hornberger: What? Why? What happened?
Liz Lemon: He called me the worst name ever.
Frank Rossitano: What did he call you?
Liz Lemon: I'm not gonna repeat it. That's how much I hate it.
Pete Hornberger: Fat can?
Liz Lemon: No.
Frank Rossitano: Mouth hooker?
Liz Lemon: No.
Frank Rossitano: Monster bitch.
Pete Hornberger: Hatchet face.
Liz Lemon: No!

[discussing the word Lutz called Liz]
Pete Hornberger: Well, you know, he was probably just blowing off
  steam. You can't fire a guy for cursing.
Liz Lemon: No, I - I'm not upset by cursing. I *love* cursing. I love
  it! But this word is not acceptable - no - because there's nothing
  you can call a guy back. There is no male equivalent to this word.
Pete Hornberger: Well, why don't we come up with one, and then you
  can call him that? Like, um, "muncus."
Frank Rossitano: "Fungdark."

[discussing the word Lutz called Liz]
Liz Lemon: The one that rhymes with the name of your favorite Todd
  Rundgren album.
Frank Rossitano: It rhymes with "Hermit of Mink Hollow"?
Liz Lemon: No!
Pete Hornberger: Oh! Oh, boy.

Pete Hornberger: You're just in reaction right now. You need to just
  take a few hours and calm down.
Liz Lemon: Don't tell me to calm down, you fungdark.
Pete Hornberger: Yeah, you're right; it doesn't work.

Liz Lemon: [after flashbacks] Oh, my God, I am! I'm a total...
Greta Johanssen: Runt! Runt! I lost my kitten. Has anyone seen my
  runt?

Jack Donaghy: Tomorrow I'm gonna be in an intense six-hour foursome
  with three other men, and one of them will be Don Geiss, and he's
  gonna get all my attention, and you're just gonna sit back and
  watch.
[across the room, Kenneth coos like a bird]

Don Geiss: Thank you so much for being here and supporting diabetes
  research.
Tracy Jordan: Hey, I feel you. Messed-up sugar runs in my family,
  too.

Pete Hornberger: Oh, I get it. You're trying to be nice now 'cause of
  what Lutz said.
Liz Lemon: No, I'm not trying to be nice. I *am* nice. I'm a nice
  person, you bald, gangly - [clears throat]
Liz Lemon: [pleasantly] I'm gonna try harder. I'm gonna try to be
  nice.

Jack Donaghy: You know, Ted, Kenneth here is one of our more
  promising young pages. He knows everything there is to know about
  the business.
Kenneth Parcell: I studied TV theory at Kentucky Mountain Bible
  College.

[Toofer's cell phone rings]
Toofer: Oh, oh, I'm so sorry, Liz; I'm so sorry. I thought I turned
  it off.
Liz Lemon: No, Toofer, take the call. Come on; this isn't Hitler's
  bunker. That would make me Hitler!

  sentence.

Jack: Lem on I'm impressed! You're beginning to think like a
  businessman.
Liz Lemon: A business woman.
Jack: I don't think that's a word.

Tracy Jordan: The only way I can feel good about myself is to be
  booby slapped by a coked out Russian stripper.

Tracy Jordan: I'm whipped. Angie got me up at 7.30 today. Did you
  know in the morning they got food, TV, almost everything? It's
  pretty good.
Liz Lemon: I did know that, yeah.

Liz Lemon: What's with the cookie jar?
Jack: I collect them.
Liz Lemon: Really, is that some kind of unresolved childhood thing?
Jack: Nice try. Eh, we never had any cookiejars in my home because my
  mother never baked a silly cookies 'cause she never felt we
  deserved any cookies so obviously it has nothing to do with my
  childhood.
Liz Lemon: But that cookie jar says 'mom' on it.
Jack: Er, I don't think so. I've always viewed it as an upside down
  'wow'.

Tracy Jordan: [after Liz tells him he can't go to a strip club] I'm
  sorry, Liz, this is who I am. You can't ask a bird not to fly. You
  can't ask a fish not to swim. You can't ask a tiger not to turn
  back into a Chinese dude at midnight!

Jack: Every time I meet a new person I figure out how I'm gonna fight
  'em.

Jack: You like cookie jars, Kenneth?
Kenneth Parcell: Well, I guess I never thought about it that much. We
  had a nice one back home in Georgia. It had a bear on it. I
  remember when my mom's friend Ron would come over. They'd go into
  the bedroom to sort out their paperwork, and I'd just go ahead and
  stare at that cookie jar. It was almost as if I took every problem
  that I ever had and I put it inside that cookie jar. And I sealed
  it up so tight that nothin' would ever, ever, ever get out. So, I
  guess to answer your question, I'd give cookie jars about a B.
Jack: Some people have so many problems that there aren't enough
  cookie jars in the world to contain them.

  she's in the bottom ten percent.
Liz Lemon: Uh, you can just tell she is, by her stupid face.
Pete Hornberger: You're a better person than this.
Liz Lemon: Jack has given me absolute power. I am the decider.
Pete Hornberger: Okay, you can't just do this.
Liz Lemon: I'm not gonna just do anything. I have a plan. Step one:
  befriend the enemy and gather information. Then, use the
  information to drive her into the bottom ten percent.
Pete Hornberger: Good lord! Your eyes - you look like that lady
  astronaut who tried to kidnap that other woman.

  or "beats" with a "z" in the name of it.
Jenna Maroney: Cardio Hip-Hop Groove it is, then.

Jack Donaghy: Lemon, come here - you've got to see this. It's a video
  of a baby panda sneezing. Sit here.
[Liz sits and Jack starts the video]
Jack Donaghy: Don't watch the mother; just watch the baby.
Liz Lemon: Oh, that is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
Jack Donaghy: Isn't that adorable? You have to fire ten percent of
  your staff.

Jack Donaghy: You have to fire ten percent of your staff.
Liz Lemon: What?
Jack Donaghy: We have to synergize backward overflow.

Liz Lemon: Ten percent? I can't fire any of these people!
Pete Hornberger: Who cares? Getting fired is better than getting
  killed by my wife, with those big farm-people hands crushing my
  windpipe.
Liz Lemon: Everything okay at home, buddy?

Pete Hornberger: Remember that little secret I told you about
  Hornberger family planning?
Liz Lemon: You mean that you flat-out lied about getting a vasectomy?
  Don't tell me *that* backfired.

Tracy Jordan: Hey, Liz Lemon: Do you know where I could find a good
  church?
Liz Lemon: How good? Like, Judaism-good, or just, like, Unitarian?

Tracy Jordan: My attorney told me I should join a church
  preemptively, 'cause juries are suspicious of celebrities who find
  religion after getting into trouble.

Tracy Jordan: So, what's your religion, Liz Lemon?
Liz Lemon: Hmm, I pretty much just do whatever Oprah tells me to.

Liz Lemon: Can I help you?
Eddie Donaghy: Yeah, sweetheart: I'm looking for Jack Donaghy.
Liz Lemon: And you are?
Eddie Donaghy: Eddie Donaghy - Jack's brother.
Liz Lemon: Really? 'Cause Jack never mentioned a brother, and his
  name is "Donagee," not "Donahee."
Eddie Donaghy: [considering her] You know, you could be pretty if you
  didn't scowl so much.
[Liz immediately believes Eddie]
Liz Lemon: Tracy, this is Jack's brother, Eddie.

Eddie Donaghy: I got a real job now: I talk homeless people into
  joining the army.
Jack Donaghy: Isn't there anything that you want?
Eddie Donaghy: One thing: I'd like my brother back. Look, I know I've
  been nothing but trouble to you your entire life. Juvie, Jonestown,
  that time I punched Goofy... Hell, I even blinded you with a bottle
  rocket!
Jack Donaghy: Ah, that was for a couple of lousy months; big deal. I
  had sex with your prom date.
Eddie Donaghy: I stole your identity.
Jack Donaghy: I threw you out of a window.
Eddie Donaghy: I convinced you you had lupus.
Jack Donaghy: I microwaved your parakeet!
Eddie Donaghy: I hated that bird.
Jack Donaghy: We had some great times, didn't we?

[the elevator opens for Liz, revealing Floyd inside, kissing a woman]
Floyd: Hey, sorry about that. Not super-appropriate in the workplace.
Liz Lemon: No... It's only inappropriate when it's ugly people.

Eddie Donaghy: Hey, Jack, you mind if I take a few grapes for dinner
  later?
Jack Donaghy: Why don't you just take the money?
Eddie Donaghy: No! If you wanna give money to someone, you give it to
  those nurses who took care of Dad at Chicago All-Saints Hospital.
  They never once said anything about the racist stuff, towards the
  end.

[Tracy is seeking a religion for publicity]
Tracy Jordan: Hey, Jack's brother: What religion are you? This one
  sounds really expensive and gay.
Eddie Donaghy: Oh, well, uh, I'm Irish Catholic. Now, I know there's
  been a lot of controversy around the church lately, ya know,
  because of The Da Vinci Code, but what's great is you can do
  anything - anything - and as long as you go to confession, it's
  forgiven.
Tracy Jordan: I'm Irish Catholic.

Eddie Donaghy: Wow! I bet Pop's lookin' down right now and saying,
  "If I could come back and do any broad, it'd be that one right
  there."
Liz Lemon: [chuckles and then speaks seriously] Ew.

[Liz, talking to herself while reading from her computer screen]
Liz Lemon: Well, well, other Liz, played saxophone in the marching
  band at Rutgers? [chuckles] Kept that a secret from your employer,
  didn't you?

Cerie: Oh, Liz? Did you put your check in already?
Liz Lemon: Oh, no. [takes out her checkbook] What do I make it out to
  - "Chicago All-Saints Hospital"?
Cerie: Eddie just said to write the initials on the check.
[Liz speaks to herself as she writes]
Liz Lemon: C-A-S-H... Son of a bitch!
[Liz looks through the box of checks; all are addressed to CASH]
Cerie: [helpfully] Eddie already took the other box.

Jack Donaghy: I was impressed by how you take a punch, Lemon.
Liz Lemon: Uh, I played dead for the worst of it, but it didn't fool
  your family.

Jack Donaghy: Oh, I had to re-hire that Liz Lemler that you fired.
Liz Lemon: Okay.
Jack Donaghy: And I didn't want any more trouble with her, so I had
  to give her a promotion, too.
Liz Lemon: Fantastic.
Jack Donaghy: It's an amazing opportunity for her, out at...
  corporate headquarters.
Liz Lemon: In Connecticut? She's transferred to Connecticut?
Jack Donaghy: Yes. That's right. It seems that things are lining up
  once again for old Liz Lemon.
[Liz smiles]
Jack Donaghy: And you say...
Liz Lemon: Thank you, Jack.
Jack Donaghy: You're welcome.

Tracy Jordan: Hey, did you hear the good news, J.D.? I'm Irish
  Catholic now, like you, Regis, and the Pope.
Jack Donaghy: Oh, ho ho, no you're not. The church already has enough
  lawsuits.
Tracy Jordan: See, I can screw up now, and then just go to
  confession. No longer do I have to throw my parties in
  international waters.
Jack Donaghy: That's not how it works, Tracy. Even though there is
  the whole confession thing, that's no free pass, because there is a
  crushing guilt that comes with being a Catholic. Whether things are
  good or bad or you're simply... eating tacos in the park, there is
  always the crushing guilt.
Tracy Jordan: I don't think I want that. I'm out.
[Jack turns to leave]
Jack Donaghy: [to himself] Somehow, I feel oddly guilty about that.
[Jack crosses himself]


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Funcooker (#3.14)}
Jack Donaghy: Lemon is right, Jenna, obviously you can't do both TGC
  and Jenny Jimplin.
Jenna Maroney: I choose the movie. My face is bigger on movies.
Jack Donaghy: No, I don't mean quit, I mean Liz will find a way to
  make both work. Am I right, Lemon?
Liz Lemon: Well, I'll have to use you less in the show...
Jack Donaghy: And I'll schale back the movie. We could cut the
  lesbian scene.
Jenna Maroney: But the Oscars love that kind of scene. [Lemon gives
  her a look] There's two guys in my gym named Oscar.

Dr. Leo Spaceman: [watching a lab rat clawing at its window] He's
  been doing that for almost 8 hours, Dr. Vicki. You know what I like
  to do for 8 hours? A TV guide crossword puzzle.

Tracy Jordan: Here comes the funcooker. [takes down his pants]

Jack Donaghy: Unfortunately, legal just informed me that the name we
  settled on for our bite size microwave, the 'BiteNuker', is highly
  offensive to those who speak either French or Dutch. A
  Franco-Dutchman would pronounce it 'Bedneuker'.
Sue: [speaking with an accent that sounds more Scandinavian than
  French or Dutch] Hey! That's awful!
Jack Donaghy: I'm sorry, Miss LaRouge Van der Hoot.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Head and the Hair (#1.11)}
Jenna Maroney: The "The Hair?"

Jack: This year I'll be a page for a day, and you'll be my boss.
Kenneth: Thank you, sir.
Jack: That's how the "Bottoms-Up" program works. I'm going to be your
  bottom Kenneth, and I want you to ride me as hard as you can.

Jenna Maroney: How's it going?
Liz Lemon: Terrible. I just want to go home and watch that show about
  midgets and eat a block of cheese.

Kenneth Parcell: Do you know why I put up with this 'pitiful job',
  Mr. Donaghy, why I fetch these folks' lunches and clean up their
  barfs? Cause they make television. And more then jazz, or musical
  theater, or morbid obesity, television is the true American
  artform.

Liz Lemon: He looked at me with those crazy handsome guy eyes. It was
  like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon ...
Jenna Maroney: [interrupting] No Liz, do not talk about stuff like
  that on your date. Guys like that do not like Star Trek.
Liz Lemon: Wars!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Moms (#4.20)}
Liz Lemon: Excuse me, Doctor Aldrin? I'm sorry. There wasn't a door
  so I just...
Buzz Aldrin: I don't believe in barriers because I always break them.

Buzz Aldrin: I'm sorry if I've disappointed you. Would you like to
  yell at the moon with Buzz Aldrin?


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Natural Order (#3.20)}
Kenneth Parcell: Now you're standing on the exact spot where Gracie
  Allen took Jack Paar's virginity.

Kenneth Parcell: Well, as a child, I had a prize pig that I thought
  was my best friend. But then one day I picked up one of her piglets
  - she went crazy! She bit off my nut sack... that I kept tied
  around my belt to feed squirrels.

Jack Donaghy: Have you ever been to Florida? It's basically a
  criminal population. It's America's Australia.

Liz Lemon: You cost the show a lot of money with your shenanigans.
Tracy Jordan: Don't patronize me with your Celtic slang, Liz Lemon.

Liz Lemon: Hey Jack, do you treat me any differently because I'm a
  woman?
Jack Donaghy: Well, I pay you a little less, yes.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The One with the Cast of 'Night Court' (#3.3)}
Jack Donaghy: I need your help, We were having sex at The Palace, she
  told me she loved me.
Liz Lemon: You did it, again?
Jack Donaghy: Well it was quick and in the meat locker, that's ok,
  right?
Liz Lemon: What is it with you men, you're like you are junkies or
  something. Why can't you just say no?
Jack Donaghy: Lemon, let me explain something to you that you could
  have no way of knowing. Emotionally unstable women are fantastic in
  the sack, I mean their self-loathing translates into... nevermind.
  I've got to get out of this. What do other guys do?
Liz Lemon: Well, one guy died, Scotty Pippen requested a transfer to
  Houston.
Jack Donaghy: Jack Donaghy: Houston is too humid, what about this
  dying thing?
Liz Lemon: Where is she now?
Jack Donaghy: Chained to the radiator at her hotel room. It was her
  idea, she's an amazing woman.

Liz Lemon: [about Claire] She's like a human Macarena. Something
  everyone did at parties in 1996.

Harry Anderson: Markie, will you do me the honor of becoming my fake
  wife so we can get our money and get the hell outta here?
Markie Post: I've waited fifteen years to hear you say those words!


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Ones (#3.19)}
Jack Donaghy: Being in a relationship means overlooking certain
  flaws. I mean, somewhere right now a guy is on a J-Date with Monica
  Lewinsky. Nobody's perfect.

Tracy Jordan: You are wise, Liz Lemon. Like a genetically manipulated
  shark.

Elisa: Lemon, isn't there a Slanket somewhere you should be filling
  with your farts?

Kenneth Parcell: My real name is... Dick Whitman!

Liz Lemon: Wow, that is one gay lion.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {The Problem Solvers (#4.5)}
Jack Donaghy: I'll tell you everything you need to know, Danny: never
  do business with a friend, never be friends with a woman and lose
  the leather bracelet.

Tracy Jordan: You're blowing up like a balloon with a grenade in it.

Kenneth Parcell: I feel as useless as a mom's college degree.

Jack Donaghy: You look like you've been around.
Simon Behrens: Yeah. I've seen a bra or two.
Jack Donaghy: I'll bet you have.

Jack: Look, Tracy - I can't just *give* you money. But what I can do
  is show you how you can *earn* all the money you need. You must
  know Arsenio...
Tracy Jordan: Hall or Billingham?
Jack: You know someone named *Arsenio Billingham*?
Tracy Jordan: No.

Tracy Jordan: I'm gonna make you a mix tape. You like Phil Collins?
Jack: I have two ears and a heart, don't I?

Jenna Maroney: I've been booked on the view!
Pete Hornberger: Oh Jenna, that's great. For the first time in your
  life you'll be in a room full of women and you'll be the least
  crazy one.
Jenna Maroney: I know.

Barbara Walters: [on The View] Let's get personal. Your father Werner
  was a burger server in suburban Santa Barbara.
Jenna Maroney: Yes, that's right.
Barbara Walters: When he spurned your mother Verna for a curly-haired
  surfer named Roberta. Did that hurt her?
Jenna Maroney: It was hard on all of us, yes.
Barbara Walters: Flurg murg glurg flurg murg murg murg tennis murg
  murg. Was a murg murg flurg?
Jenna Maroney: I'll always be his little girl. [cries]
Barbara Walters: [puts her hand on Jenna's shoulder] Glurg.

Liz Lemon: [trying to figure out the title to Jenna's film] Could it
  be 'Roar her, gem her'?
Pete Hornberger: No, that doesn't make any sence. It's got to be
  'Oral Germ Whore'.

Jack: We have a product we want you to give an endorsement to.
Dr. Leo Spaceman: I'll do it! What is it?
Jack: It's called a Tracey Jordan Meat Machine, it's a duel press
  grill.
Dr. Leo Spaceman: Say no more, if it's giving people meat, then I'm
  on board.

Josh Girard: I had to let Tony watch me pee to get this tape.

Tracy Jordan: I'm gonna make you a mix tape. You like Phil Collins?
Jack: I've got two ears and a heart, don't I?

Tracy Jordan: He bit Shug Knight! He made Rasheed Wallace cry!

French Dude: [in French, subtitled] I hate hip hop. I assure you
  those guys couldn't appreciate a good French wine. Also I love Dane
  Cook! Wonderful! Have a good weekend!

Kenneth: I'm sorry, this is a private party.
Ridikolous: Hold on: we're with Tracy Jordan.
Kenneth: And Mr. Jordan himself said "don't let no one in who's not
  on the list 'cause this mess is gonna get raw like sushi, so haters
  to the left."
Ridikolous: What's your game?
Kenneth: Boggle.

Ridikolous: What's your game?
Kenneth: Boggle!

Tracy Jordan: The manatee has become the Mento.

Liz Lemon: Tracy, do you think I'm racist?
Tracy Jordan: No. I think you like to dress black men as Oprah is
  part of your effort to protect our dignity.
Liz Lemon: Oh, by the way, when you do that impression, don't forget
  to stretch everything out. "We've got John Travoltaaaaaaaaa!"

Liz Lemon: [after being accused of being a racist] How racist is
  this? I'm going to the Source Awards tomorrow night.
Steven Black: [laughs] Well let me get on the black phone and call
  the NAACP, so they can send you your medal right now.


# "30 Rock" (2006) {Tracy Does Conan (#1.7)}
Tracy Jordan: Where your feet at, blue man?

Liz Lemon: Why are you wearing a tux?
Jack: It's after six. What am I, a farmer?

Jack: Conan, Tracy's really excited to be back on your show.
Conan O'Brien: I don't know. He's kind of a loose cannon, and I like
  to surround myself with people who don't try to stab me.
Jack: Well, Tracy's feeling a lot better now. He's under a doctor's
  care.
Conan O'Brien: That's what they said about Hasselhoff, then he tried
  to make out with me during a commercial break.
Jack: Conan, this is important to me. So, we can either do this the
  easy way or the hard way.
Conan O'Brien: What's the hard way?
Jack: You do a live Christmas Eve special from Kabul every year until
  the War on Terror is won.
Conan O'Brien: Tell Tracy I'll see him tonight, you black Irish
  bastard.
Jack: Back at you, red.

Tracy Jordan: I have to be charming on Conan tonight. This is my
  chance to redeem myself with mainstream America.
Toufer: Okay, well. Just tell us some things about your life, and
  we'll try to punch it up and make it talk show-worthy.
Pete: Maybe something about you and your wife.
Tracy Jordan: Me and my wife like to play rape. She go in the
  bathroom and do her hair. Then, I'll put on a ski mask...
Frank: Hey, uh, you got anything about being a dad? People eat that
  garbage up.
Tracy Jordan: I like to walk around my house naked, to remind my
  oldest son who's still got the biggest ding-dong.
Pete: No.
Tracy Jordan: Or I could tell the story of how I met Sharon Stone.
Pete: What was that?
Tracy Jordan: I was pooping in the ladies' room at The Ivy...
Pete: No.

Tracy Jordan: What else is on my mind-grapes?

Bianca Donaghy: Fine.
Jack: I want the art supplies I gave you on your fortieth birthday
  and any subsequent art projects you made with them.
Bianca Donaghy: Fine.
Jack: I want all of our love letters.

  Cheddar!

Liz Lemon: [on the phone] Hi, my name is Liz Lemon and I received
  flowers from your shop tonight, and I can't tell who they're
  from... No, no, I did read the card, but it's not signed... No, I'm
  not with so many men that it's impossible for me to guess... Well,
  that is just... Oh, well, you know what? I found the card,
  actually, and they're from your mom, so tell your gay mom I said
  thanks!
[hangs up]

Jack: One minute you're newlyweds, making love on the floor of the
  Concorde. Then, before you know it, your lawyers are arguing over
  who gets to keep the box your dog defecates in.
Liz Lemon: You taught your dog to poop in a box?
Jack: Bianca did. But, damn it, I want that box.

Toofer: Okay, I got a hard one: Osama bin Laden, Martha Stewart,
  Jenna.
Frank Rossitano: Bone Osama bin Laden, to shame him, and then his own
  people would murder him. Marry Martha Stuart, 'cause, you know, she
  seems like a dirty bird, and kill Jenna.
Josh Girard: Cerie, marry, boff, kill: Lutz, Toofer or Kenneth.
Cerie: I'd marry Toofer, because he's classy. I'd kill Lutz, sorry
  Lutz.
Lutz: The thought that you'd do anything to me is awesome.

  better understand that the group handling the dirtiness has to be
  small, and it has to be committed, and it doesn't go out and chirp
  at bars.

Norm Hitzges: If you're gonna be a dirty program, you better be good

# "30 for 30" (2009) {The U (#1.7)}
Randall Hill: It wasn't my fault that they built that stadium where
  there was a tunnel in the endzone that I scored in. It wasn't my
  fault that the doors were open in that tunnel. It wasn't my fault
  that it was not illegal for me to run through that tunnel. Don't
  blame me. You can blame the architects of that stadium. You can
  blame the University of Texas for taunting us. You can blame Robert
  Bailey for setting up the whole thing by knocking the first person
  out. You can blame Craig Erickson for throwing me the ball. You can
  blame the defensive back for not being good enough to cover me.
  It's just not my fault that I ran through that tunnel.

Walter: What do you think I am?

Gracie: Keep it clean till I get back.
Elizabeth: Gangrene. That'll be that. And if it gets hold, that's the

Ellie: Why?
Frank: To get more exercise - you heard the doc.

Frank: Joy is a decent, kind young woman - qualities that an
  unscrupulous so-and-so might take advantage of.

  When women get gray hair, they look old.
Dick Solomon: When women get breasts, they look sexy. When men get
  breasts, they look old.
Mary Albright: Good point!

Dick Solomon: Guns don't kill people, physics kills people.

Dick Solomon: Where would we be without the agitators of the world
  attaching the electrodes of knowledge to the nipples of ignorance?

Mary Albright: Haven't you come to your senses yet?

Mary Albright: Yeah! It's called "the 70s."

Harry Solomon: So, when can I touch your breasts?
Sally Solomon: Right before you die!

Harry Solomon: Hey world, I'm alive. And these pants are washable.

[Dick has entered the office wearing a tight-fitting construction
  worker's outfit and a tool belt]
Dick Solomon: Whaddaya think, Nina? Ya like beefcake?
Nina Campbell: Not from your funky bakery. [winks]

Tourist: Excuse me, we've been driving around for hours. Do you know
  of any hotels that have rooms?
Harry Solomon: I believe that *all* hotels have rooms.

Harry Solomon: Dubcek's threatening to make me work it off, and I
  don't think she's talking about mowing the lawn.

Dick Solomon: I want ceaseless joy and never-ending passion like
  Romeo and Juliet.
Mary Albright: They both wound up dead.
Dick Solomon: Antony and Cleopatra.
Mary Albright: Dead.
Dick Solomon: That couple from Wuthering Heights.
Mary Albright: Insane and dead.
Dick Solomon: F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda.
Mary Albright: Drunk, insane, and dead.
Dick Solomon: Tristan and Isolde.
Mary Albright: Abgeschossen.
Dick Solomon: Aha, Siegfried and Roy.
Mary Albright: Okay, one.

Sally Solomon: What happened, Harry?
Harry Solomon: It came out!
Dick Solomon: Is it an alien?
Harry Solomon: Well, it's purple, and it's slimy, and it's got a
  hose.
Sally Solomon: A hose?
Tommy Solomon: Oh, great. It's a mutant.
Dick Solomon: Alright, we'll kidnap him, and hide him, when it's a
  teenager we'll set him free, and then if it's really messed up, we
  can blame him on television.
[Marry Albright arrives]
Mary Albright: They just brought him to the nursery. He is positively
  glowing.
Harry Solomon: Now it's glowing.
Mary Albright: Let's go see him. He's got Vicky's eyes.
Harry Solomon: What's he doing with Vicky's eyes?
Sally Solomon: I just hope it's not eating them.

[Looking at the babies at the nursery]
Tommy Solomon: Which one is it?
Dick Solomon: It must be him - it's hideous.
Man: Hey, that's my daughter.
Dick Solomon: I'm so sorry. SHE'S hideous.

Dick Solomon: Oh, Mary! I've had one of those terrible dreams again!
  We were getting married!
Mary Albright: Oh.
Dick Solomon: No, that's the good part. Then, my family showed up.
Mary Albright: Oh, and they objected?
Dick Solomon: Well... They had issues.
Mary Albright: Don't worry. I wrote a speech in case that happens.
  Well, it's just two words. One of them's "off".

[Repeated line]
Harry Solomon: Incoming message from the Big Giant Head!

Harry Solomon: Incoming message from the Big Giant Head. The Big
  Giant Head is unable to take your call at this time. You must wait
  until your call is answered in the order it was recieved.

Harry Solomon: And my job will be to figure out what causes harm to
  the human form. Like getting your fingers crushed in a car door.
  Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

Dick Solomon: [reading Dr. Seuss] My God, this man is a genius!

Harry Solomon: Dick, I can't feel the entire right side of my body.
  Will someone please call 116?

Dick Solomon: [reading the Bible] Wow, these people begat their
  brains out!

Dick Solomon: You want the truth? You want the truth? Well, I can't
  handle the truth!

Dick Solomon: I'm not finger-pointing... [points at Mary] but it's
  YOUR fault! YOU!

Dick Solomon: Nina, who is this 'Tom' that Mary keeps talking about?
Nina Campbell: I don't know, and it's none of my business.
Dick Solomon: It's none of my business and I'm obsessed with it!
Nina Campbell: That's typical. Why is it that men think that when you
  plant the flag, you own the mountain.
Dick Solomon: I spent two years climbing that mountain, and I'm not
  about to let some guy yodel on it!

[around Super Bowl season]
Harry Solomon: Tell me what you've done to Sally. Where are you
  taking her?
Mascha: I can't. I wish I could.
Harry Solomon: Can't you give me a hint?
Mascha: All right... We're going to do something on the weekend... in
  San Diego.
Harry Solomon: Why can't you give me hint?
Mascha: We're going to do something on Sunday... in San Diego.
Harry Solomon: Just one clue?
Mascha: We're going to something on SUNDAY... in SAN DIEGO... at a
  STADIUM.
Harry Solomon: Just one tiny clue?
Mascha: The Super Bowl, Harry!
Harry Solomon: WORK WITH ME, BABY! WHICH SUPER BOWL?

Dick Solomon: Nina, take my car to the garage and rotate my tires.
Nina Campbell: That's not in my job description.
Dick Solomon: What is in your job description?
Nina Campbell: Typing.
Dick Solomon: Ok, well, type it into your job description and get my
  tires rotated.

Sally Solomon: Don't listen to him, he's just a kid.
Salesman: Oh, don't worry. I used to be a kid myself... a long time
  ago.
[laughs]
Salesman: Say there, sport, you like girls?
Tommy Solomon: Yeah. Sorry.

The Big Giant Head: The yelling will cease or the killing will
  commence!

[at career day]
Officer Don: Sorry I'm late, kids, but I was just involved in one of
  the world's scariest police chases.
Kid: How did it end?
Officer Don: The guy got away. [dejected groans] but, I rolled my
  car! [cheers]

August: Your son is impossible.
Dick Solomon: And you're a pain in the ass, you're made for each
  other.

Tommy Solomon: I am now the coolest punk in school.
Dick Solomon: Well, congratulations. What did you do?
Tommy Solomon: I got suspended for setting off the fire alarm.
Dick Solomon: They suspended you? You saved hundreds of lives.
Tommy Solomon: That's the best part; there was no fire.
Dick Solomon: Tommy, this is outrageous. The next time you set off
  the fire alarm, you'd damn well better start a fire first.

Dick Solomon: I don't mean to panic anyone, but I'm afraid the
  calamari has been infested with baby squid.

Tommy Solomon: Dick! Sally and Harry wont buy me a beer.
Dick Solomon: Sally, Harry, don't be so cheap!

Nina Campbell: You think you're the smartest man on the planet, don't
  you?
Dick Solomon: For the thousandth time, yes!

Dick Solomon: Badgers do not suck! They bite!

[repeated line]
Dick Solomon: I'm gorgeous!

[Dick is locked in an invisible box and feels the walls]
Dick Solomon: Oh no! He's turned me into a mime!

[Harry is dressed as an alien for Halloween]
Mamie Dubcek: Oh, Harry. You're an alien.
[Harry screams]
Harry Solomon: NO, I'M NOT! I mean, yes I am.

[Dick goes to a Halloween party as a pirate]
Partygoer: Ahoy, matey. Where are your buccaneers?
Dick Solomon: Under my buckin' hat.

Dick Solomon: Who needs Christmas anyway? I say "Bug Humbar".

Harry Solomon: Talk to the hand.

Sally Solomon: Hey, buy us a couple of beers?
Man: Sure. [Hands Sally and Nina two beers]
Man: So, you girls going to the big game?
Sally Solomon: We don't want to talk to you. We're just broke. [Takes
  beers and leaves]

Mary Albright: Have a little compassion, Sally, we're healthy. We
  have to help him.
Sally Solomon: I say he's lame. Shoot him.

Officer Don: Hamlet? The story is as old as time: Pretty boy son has
  a rich daddy, and a good-looking mommy. The uncle knocks off daddy,
  marries mommy, and he cuts pretty boy out of the action. So junior
  goes crazy and he kills them all. Not a pretty story... but there
  it is.
Tommy Solomon: Isn't that the plot to 'The Lion King'?

Tommy Solomon: Remind me never to ask you for another favor again!
Dick Solomon: You weren't right for the role.
Harry Solomon: Hey, how'd the audition go?
Tommy Solomon: I lost the part. The "Di-rec-tor" didn't think I was
  good enough!
Dick Solomon: You were good: you had delivery, presence, timing, you
  just didn't have that indefinable something extra.
Tommy Solomon: I was just trying to score some points with my
  girlfriend, is that too much to ask?
Dick Solomon: 'Romeo & Juliet' is a Shakespearian tragedy, it has
  nothing to do with a horny teenager and his girlfriend!

Sally Solomon: You just can't imagine what it feels like, Dick. It's
  like he reached in... and pulled all the bones out of my body...
  [Sally starts crying]
Dick Solomon: My god, what are you doing?
Sally Solomon: [Wipes her tears] Apparently I'm leaking!

Sally Solomon: YOU! [Points at man by bar] Your sexual organs are in
  total diometric opposition to mine!
Man: Well... hey! So, can I give you a call sometime?

Dick Solomon: This is just perfect. I try to mold us into a family
  that will blend in, and what do I get? A surly teenager, a sister
  obsessed with a man, and a brother who drinks too much. Is there
  another family in the whole world like this? I don't think so!

Nina Campbell: Hey, check out the bartender.
Mary Albright: [sarcastically] Ooh... God's gift to women.
Sally Solomon: I hope he kept the receipt.

Sally Solomon: This is the bake sale committee, right?
Mrs. Hartzinger: Yes, I don't believe I've seen you before.
Sally Solomon: I don't believe you're blonde.

Sally Solomon: Oh, how exciting. I am SO glad I get to be the woman.
  Next planet I get to be something BIG... WITH HORNS!

Patty Muller: I don't envy you at having to take care of three men. I
  only got Frank and he's a full-time job. Just once, I'd like to see
  that man pick up a sock.
Sally Solomon: I'd like to see men put their dirty dishes in the
  sink.
Patty Muller: I'd like to see them do laundry.
Sally Solomon: I'd like to see them crammed between two steel wheels
  and ground into a fine paste.
Patty Muller: You know, I'd like to see that myself.
Sally Solomon: You let me know.

Dick Solomon: And I've done some shaving. Somewhere on my body you
  will discover a tufted heart.

Harry Solomon: You know, one thing I learned - television always goes
  better with food.

Tommy Solomon: Actually, Sally, uh, Halloween is revered as the day
  when the graves yawn and the dead rise.
Harry Solomon: Plus you get to stick candy corns up your nose.

Mary Albright: Are these magic brownies?
Dick Solomon: Pepperidge Farm.

Dick Solomon: Lieutenant!
Sally Solomon: Yes, sir!
Dick Solomon: This planet has crossed the line. Assemble the giant
  robot.

Mamie Dubcek: Do you have anything for rope burns?

Dick Solomon: Just act normal.
Mary Albright: I'd ask you to do the same, but I'm afraid that ship
  has sailed.

Dick Solomon: I find you pompous, judgmental, and completely
  self-absorbed. Would you be my friend?

[to a policeman]
Sally Solomon: Well, Don, if I had a gun like that I wouldn't be
  sitting behind a desk till I ran out of bullets.

[Mary and Dick are in a restaurant]
Dick Solomon: Mary, the waiter made a mistake. You ordered Surf and
  Turf. They brought you steak and lobster.
Mary Albright: Dick, that's what surf and turf is.
Dick Solomon: Oh... I thought it was water and grass.

Sally Solomon: How nice, it's the gift that keeps on sucking.

Dick Solomon: What does the crowd look like out there?
Sally Solomon: Why don't you open up the curtain and look?
Dick Solomon: Oh, nice breath. What did you have for lunch, garlic?
Sally Solomon: Well naturally you didn't eat lunch at all so you can
  chew on the scenery.
Dick Solomon: Great mastery of theater terms. Did you learn taht you
  in your book called "How to Perform on Stage?" because maybe you
  should start with the chapter called "How to Perform on Stage".
Sally Solomon: Yeah? Well maybe you shouldn't do card tricks that
  reflect off of your big, bald head!

Harry Solomon: [eyes closed] Sally, I can't see behind my eyelids.
Sally Solomon: Open them.
Harry Solomon: [opens his eyes] Ohhh, they're manual...

Evil Dick: Do I make myself clear Tommy?
Harry Solomon: Oh no, I'm Harry.
Evil Dick: No, from now on you will be referred to as Tommy.
Tommy Solomon: Hey, what about me?
Evil Dick: You will be Tommy too.
Tommy Solomon: Wait, so Tommy as in the number 2 or as what...?
Evil Dick: You will all be known as Tommy!

Tommy Solomon: Holy cow, we weren't just dating leggy babes...
Harry Solomon: We were dating leggy babes from beyond!

Harry Solomon: I could do it with my eyes closed!
Tommy Solomon: You do everything with your eyes closed!

[the Solomons are blasting "Entertainment Tonight" on their new TV]
Alissa Strudwick: How loud do you need to hear that it's Mary
  Steenburgen's birthday?

Leon: Dr. Solomon, I have an answer, but I think it might be wrong.
Dick Solomon: Why, Leon, of course it's wrong. You'll always be
  wrong! In fact, the odds of you being right are staggering!

Sally Solomon: So the meatloaf is essentially ground beef and bread
  crumbs?
Tommy Solomon: Right.
Sally Solomon: And ground beef is essentially nothing more than dead
  cow?
Tommy Solomon: Right.
Sally Solomon: So I have dead cow on my hands? Ahhhhhhhhh! [runs off]
Tommy Solomon: Women.

Sally Solomon: [about her breasts] Hmm, they seem to have greater
  power when they collide.

Dick Solomon: So tell me, how far away is Cleveland?
Frank: An assault charge. The federal court house is there.
Dick Solomon: Right! Cleveland is a felonious assault away!

Dick Solomon: Our home for this mission was Earth, a third-rate
  planet. I got a third-rate car, a job at a third-rate university
  and now we were looking at a third-floor apartment.

Tommy Solomon: [pointing to the sky] I've been there. I've been
  there. And there. And there.
Harry Solomon: The long, boring stories you must have!

Dick Solomon: My woman won't let me be a woman! Excuse me, I'm going
  to go draw a bath and then have a fat-free cookie.

Harry Solomon: So what are you in here for?
Man: The police think I'm crazy because I told them I was from the
  planet Circon 9.
Harry Solomon: Do you know Steve?

Coach Strickland: Solomon, climb the rope!
Tommy Solomon: What's at the top of the rope?
Coach Strickland: Your self-esteem.
Tommy Solomon: My self-esteem?
Coach Strickland: Now climb the rope or you get to go sit with the
  girls.
Tommy Solomon: So if I don't climb the rope, I get to go sit with the
  girls? You're going to have to help me out here, I'm failing to see
  the downside!

Harry Solomon: The manual said hair below the shoulders but not above
  the head. I don't think anyone is going to look down there.

Dick Solomon: [Dr. Albright is being pursued by another man] I
  have... a plan!
Tommy Solomon: Remember, Dick, you're not allowed to disintegrate
  Earthlings.
Dick Solomon: [pause] I have... *another* plan!

Tommy Solomon: [Tommy and Harry are moving Sally's belongings out of
  the house] [Tommy carries a large box with difficulty] Oh, Harry,
  you've got to help me with this box, it's filled with rocks and
  books and stuff.
Harry Solomon: Step aside. [Harry grips the box and gets ready to
  push it up, as he does, the box flies over his head]
Tommy Solomon: [giggling]... It was empty... [Tommy leaves]
Harry Solomon: No. [grabs the box and starts to leave] I'm the
  strongest man in the world!

Harry Solomon: So, Dick. Wanna know what I heard around the water
  cooler today?... There's a weird guy hanging 'round the water
  cooler.

Officer Don: Sally, I think you're only attracted to my uniform! Do
  you know what this means?
Sally Solomon: Yeah...
Officer Don: It means you'll never see me out of uniform again!

Mary Albright: So are you glad we tried something new?
Dick Solomon: Not really, it made me cold... and shrivelly.

Harry Solomon: Come on boys, we're going to San Francisco!
Mascha: [off screen] San Diego!
Harry Solomon: San Diego!

Mascha: [On the roof of the second floor] Harry what do you see when
  you look at me?
Harry Solomon: You're fun; you're sweet, sure a little bit insecure
Mascha: Don't you think I'm beautiful?
Harry Solomon: Sure you're cute; you've got that little mole next to
  your mouth
Mascha: Don't you want to give me something?
Harry Solomon: I want to give you the mountains, the river, the trees
Mascha: I was thinking more like expensive jewelery
Harry Solomon: Actually I do want to give you something [he pulls out
  a lollipop] I had the barber take a bit off the top
Mascha: I need to tell you something, I'm so terrible at this, I'm
  not from around here
Harry Solomon: I'm not from around here
Mascha: I'm not like other women
Harry Solomon: I'm not like other guys
Mascha: I can't tell you why
Harry Solomon: I can't tell you why either!
Mascha: We have so much in common
Harry Solomon: [putting his arm around her] Yes we do [Mascha puts
  the purple lollipop in her mouth]


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {36! 24! 36! Dick!: Part 2 (#3.15)}

  team because I forgot to wear underwear... occasionally.
[Don, Judith and Rico drink deeply from their beers]


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {A Dick on One Knee (#2.16)}
[in a bar, Dick asks his students for advice]
Dr. Dick Solomon: Gentlemen, how do you know when it's time to get
  married?
Aubrey Pitman: Right when that little stick thing turns blue.

Sally Solomon: I've dated more than any of you.
Harry Solomon: But by no stretch of the imagination have you been the
  most promiscuous.

Sally Solomon: I'm getting married.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Why are you doing this?
Sally Solomon: Two reasons: I'm a woman and he asked me.

Sally Solomon: It's what women are supposed to do: Get married, have
  kids, hire total strangers to raise them and then wonder where they
  went wrong.


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {A Friend in Dick (#3.8)}
[after an awkward moment between the two, Dick shares with Mary his
  fear that he's lost Officer Don's friendship - when Don walks into
  the room... ]
Officer Don Orville: Hey, Dick...?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Don?
Officer Don Orville: So...
Dr. Dick Solomon: Look...
Officer Don Orville: Hey!
Dr. Dick Solomon: Yeah.
Officer Don Orville: Yeah.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Last night?
Officer Don Orville: No biggie.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Cool.
Officer Don Orville: So... burger?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Fries?
Officer Don Orville: Later?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Sure.
Officer Don Orville: Solid!
Dr. Dick Solomon: [after Don leaves the room, Dick swaggers to all]
  That's my main man!


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {Ab-dick-ted (#1.9)}
Dr. Dick Solomon: So, no matter how obnoxious you are, how much of a
  burden you become, you can still count on the forgiveness of your
  family?
Dr. Mary Albright: Yeah.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Even if they touch your radio and refuse to make
  smoked chub and disobey your orders not to kill?
Dr. Mary Albright: Yeah, even then.

Dr. Dick Solomon: We seem to be annoyed with each other, and as
  fascinating as that is, it's irritating as hell.

Dr. Mary Albright: Oh, sure! Aliens traveled billions of lightyears
  across space just to ram a probe up Roy Albright's butt!

[having a family meeting after just learning of Roy's alien
  abduction]
Dr. Dick Solomon: No, no, NO! We are not killing *anyone*!

[subtly trying to kill Roy with a boulder to the head]
Sally Solomon: You know what really turns me on? The back of a man's
  head.


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {Alien Hunter (#4.20)}
Harry Solomon: [to Ned] You know, I don't get to say this to a lot of
  people, but... I'm smarter than you.

Judith Draper: [after Charlotte and Ned drugged and tied everyone
  downstairs in the basement] It's official this is the worst party
  I've ever been too.


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {Angry Dick (#1.13)}
Frank Muller: You think you're so much better than us, don't you.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Yes, but you'll evolve.

[Dick is angry at Frank]
Dr. Dick Solomon: I have a plan.
Sally Solomon: Remember we're not allowed to liquefy humans.
Dr. Dick Solomon: [pauses] Ok, I have another plan.

Sally Solomon: So, does Frank know you're with me?
Patty Muller: No, I told him I was setting a perm. Does Dick know
  you're with me?
Sally Solomon: No, I injected him with a sedative. I've got at least
  two more hours.
Patty Muller: Oh, we're like Thelma and Louise, except we just came
  to the supermarket, we haven't killed anyone.
Sally Solomon: It's early yet.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Come on Harry, let's make like a banana split and
  leave.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Isn't this place magnificent?
Harry Solomon: It's the Garage Mahal.

Tommy Solomon: I'm invoking a Supreme Directive. I'll need witnesses.
Dr. Dick Solomon: What is it?
Tommy Solomon: I want you to remember who you are.
Dr. Dick Solomon: I'm the High Commander!
Tommy Solomon: And what is "The High Commander's Oath?"
Dr. Dick Solomon: [quoting] "As High Commander, I vow to handle all
  problems with restraint and deliberation; I will strive to
  understand other life-forms; I will avoid aggression, and make
  peace with all those who piss me off."


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {Assault with a Deadly Dick (#1.17)}
Dr. Dick Solomon: This planet has crossed the line. Assemble the
  giant robot!
Sally Solomon: Um... we didn't pack it. You wanted the room for your
  exercise bike.

Officer Don: Okay Mr. Solomon. It's time to finger your perp.
[Dick points at Mary]
Dr. Dick Solomon: Believe me I've tried but she just won't let me.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Your chirpy optimism has no place in reality. Guess
  what? Santa Claus is dead! Beaten senseless for his shiny black
  boots and his reindeer don't give a damn!

Dr. Dick Solomon: What kind of place is this where you can't wave
  handfuls of money around in the middle of the night?

[to Don]
Sally Solomon: If I had a gun like that, I wouldn't be sitting behind
  a desk until I ran out of bullets.

Sally Solomon: Dick, I've been telling you. This planet is in a bad
  neighborhood.

[about the stolen car radio]
Sally Solomon: Wait a minute. I know what's happened here. You see it
  all the time on the news.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Uh, toupees?

[referring to the mall]
Sally Solomon: I think the entire planet should be covered by one big
  roof.
Dr. Dick Solomon: And we should never be more than fifteen feet from
  a weenie on a stick.

[when asked what he thought of the mall]
Harry Solomon: How would I know? The escalator broke down and I was
  stuck there for an hour and a half.

# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {Body & Soul & Dick (#1.8)}
[about what will happen to their earthly bodies after they go on to
  explore other planets]
Sally Solomon: Dick, I feel different here. I mean, I like Sally.
  What will happen to her when I'm gone? What happens to all her
  stuff? All her shoes?

[Dr. Hanlan just died. Earlier Mary was saying how she wished he
  would die]
Dr. Dick Solomon: [shouting enthusiastically] Dr. Albright. You got
  your wish.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Behind his back, they deride him, but to his face
  they kiss his ass.
Harry Solomon: Well, that's just the kind of stunt you can see only
  on cable.

Dr. Dick Solomon: How can we honor the memory of a man like Leonard
  Hanlin? Like all men, he was governed by the laws of physics. It is
  a scientific fact that hearts and clocks slow down as they approach
  the speed of light. Dr. Hanlin's heart reached that speed at 7:35
  pm last night, according to the coroner, transforming his matter
  into energy, into pure white light. Though he is no longer with us,
  he is all around us.

Tommy Solomon: Matter into energy?
Sally Solomon: Could you have been more trite?
Harry Solomon: Why didn't you just phone it in?

Dr. Leonard Hamlin: And I admire your courage, Mrs. Sumner. A framed
  Audobon print over the mantle posing as art - *that* takes courage.

Dr. Leonard Hamlin: So tell me Dick, what do you think of my work?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Mechanistic and disturbingly fascist, but
  pretentious high schoolers might find it thought-provoking.

Sally Solomon: [last lines - the whole family is gazing up at the
  night sky] When *are* we going to leave this planet?
Dr. Dick Solomon: When we know everything there is to know about
  life.
Harry Solomon: Whoa, good thing we have cable.


# "3rd Rock from the Sun" (1996) {Brains and Eggs (#1.1)}
Harry Solomon: Women. You can't live with them, and yet they're
  everywhere.

[Sally is wearing a revealing dress]
[sarcastically]
Nina Campbell: Nice dress.
Sally Solomon: I just threw it on.
Nina Campbell: Yeah, well, you almost missed.

Dr. Mary Albright: For future reference: I have a red Volvo.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Please, Dr. Albright, we barely know each other.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Nina, you smell great!
Nina Campbell: Thanks, I try...
[Dick buries his face in Nina's rear end]
Nina Campbell: That had better be your nose!

[Sally is fussing with her cleavage]
Sally Solomon: They seem to have greater power when they collide. I'm
  not wrong, am I?

Dr. Dick Solomon: [seeing a couple kissing] Look, they're cleaning
  each other.

Dr. Dick Solomon: [Harry is holding a flashlight with the bulb end
  facing inwards] You know, I have an urge to hold that.
Harry Solomon: Well, that's exactly what it's for.
Dr. Dick Solomon: May I?
Harry Solomon: Please.
Dr. Dick Solomon: [takes the flashlight and holds it the same way]
  You know I rather like this.
Harry Solomon: Yes.
Dr. Dick Solomon: I find this very satisfying.
Harry Solomon: I know.
Dr. Dick Solomon: [after a pause] I wonder what Dr Albright is doing
  right now.
Harry Solomon: OK, that's enough. [takes back flashlight]

Dr. Dick Solomon: [after seeing Mary putting on lipstick] Excuse me,
  I have the sudden urge to clean you. [kisses her passionately]

Mrs. Sumner: May I take your coat?
Dr. Dick Solomon: If I can keep my pants.

Harry Solomon: Dick, I can't see through my eyelids.
Sally Solomon: Open them.
Harry Solomon: Oh, they're manual.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Sally, I want you to observe her. Find out what
  women on this planet do.
Sally Solomon: Well, why can't Harry do it?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Because you're the woman.
Sally Solomon: That brings up a very good question; why am I the
  woman?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Because you lost.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Leon, of course it's wrong! The odds against you're
  being right are... staggering! You have a great advantage, you know
  the outcome. You will be wrong. Don't fear it, embrace your
  wrongness!

Tommy Solomon: Why are you talking to me like I'm a child?
Dr. Dick Solomon: You are a child.
Tommy Solomon: I'm older than you.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Well, now I'm bigger. And on this planet, size
  matters.

Nina Campbell: Is your wife out of town.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Uh... Mrs. Solomon is no longer with us. She uh...
  burned up on re-entry.

Dr. Mary Albright: This is a small office and you are behaving like a

Dr. Mary Albright: Why? Too much?
Tommy Solomon: Well not if you're fighting crime.

Harry Solomon: So what is this thing you're going to anyway?
Dr. Dick Solomon: It's a charity auction.
Tommy Solomon: And what's charity again?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Well all I know is they're giving out free drinks
  and paddles with numbers on them.
Harry Solomon: Well I guess that's what charity's all about: getting
  liquored up and spanking your neighbor.

Dr. Dick Solomon: We can make little differences; we just can't make
  global differences.
Harry Solomon: Can we blow up the Earth?
Dr. Dick Solomon: You see, that's a global difference.
Harry Solomon: It's so hard to keep track of all this.

  You don't do that! You don't steal somebody's maid!
Nina Campbell: You stole her from Judith.
Dr. Mary Albright: I did not steal her. I lured her with money. [to
  Dick] Give me back my maid!
Dr. Dick Solomon: I'm sorry, Mary. But Kathy is not some product to
  be bought or sold on the open market. She is a living breathing
  human being with feelings, thoughts and emotions. You don't *own*
  her! [pause] *I* do.

Officer Don Orville: Let me lay out the cold hard facts for you,
  Tommy. If you are involved in something criminal, there is a one in
  five chance you'll be caught. If you are prosecuted, there is a 2%

Dr. Dick Solomon: What about inside the pants?

Dr. Dick Solomon: You're a decorated veteran. I thought you could
  handle it.
Sally Solomon: Well, I can't. This is hard.

  like he reached in and pulled all of the bones out of my body.
[Sally starts to cry and Dick starts moving away from her]
Dr. Dick Solomon: My God! What are you doing?
Sally Solomon: Apparently I'm leaking.

Sally Solomon: Damn it Dick. Give me some pain I can define!
Dr. Dick Solomon: I will not jam your hand in the toaster again.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Well, one of us has to experience sex and I am
  getting nowhere with her.
[Dick points towards Mary]
Sally Solomon: Well, why didn't you say so? I mean if sex is so
  important, you and I can do it right here on the desk and get it
  out of the way.

[reading the bible]
Dr. Dick Solomon: Why are you listening to the serpent? Don't eat the
  fruit! Don't eat the fruit!
[he turns the page, reads it, then looks over at Mary]
Dr. Dick Solomon: Woman.

Sally Solomon: Tell me Dick, what kind of shampoo do you use?
Dr. Dick Solomon: I don't know.
Sally Solomon: Exactly. And you feel the urge to have an 8 pounds
  screaming larva rip its way out of your lower abdomen?
Dr. Dick Solomon: No, I think I can do without that.
Sally Solomon: See? Here you and I are completely different life
  forms and it's just some sick cosmic joke that we have to share a
  planet.

Dr. Dick Solomon: So, lieutenant, give us a full report on your
  assignment.
Sally Solomon: He was wonderful. He thinks I'm wonderful. He asked me
  where I've been all his life.
Dr. Dick Solomon: You didn't tell him.
Sally Solomon: All the coordinates. Thank goodness he didn't believe
  me so I didn't have to kill him.
Dr. Dick Solomon: What happened after dinner?
Sally Solomon: Well, he wanted to sleep with me, I wanted sex, but
  since he was tired I let him go home.

Sally Solomon: Hello, Brad. I've come to check your phone.

  with a stranger the night before you're suppose to do it with your
  girlfriend for the very first time on Valentine's Day.

Dr. Mary Albright: I can't believe this.
Dr. Dick Solomon: What do you mean?
Dr. Mary Albright: People don't do this. People don't look at other
  people's psychological files to get gift ideas!

Harry Solomon: [watching a pay-per-view] Are those two women naked?
Tommy Solomon: Yes they are.
Harry Solomon: So... What did that guy do to deserve that spanking?

Sally Solomon: Hey you guys, why is everything so red on Valentine's
  Day? I mean the greeting cards, and the candy, even the tire ads.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Well, red represents the blood that was spilled at
  the massacre.
Harry Solomon: Massacre?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Yeah, the St. Valentine's Day massacre. It's a very
  big deal here on Earth.

Alissa Strudwick: Hey guys!
Tommy Solomon: Hey Alyssa! How you doin'?

  you were 14.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Are you saying that just because Sonja and I share
  the same intellectual interests, we're destined to share the same
  bed?
Dr. Mary Albright: Yes.

  intelligent to have sex with me!

Dr. Dick Solomon: The same thing happened to me!

  bastard'.

  cheese and sausage shops of Communist East Berlin."

  200 hours cleaning up other people's trash on the highway.
Officer Don: But I wanted to teach him a lesson, so I charged him as
  an adult.
Sally Solomon: What does that mean?
Tommy Solomon: I got a $40 fine.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Actually it's more of a "near death-wish" but if we
  rule out death I really think it undercuts the experience, you

[after Sally had her first sneeze, Harry also had his first sneeze]
Sally Solomon: Was it as good for you as it was for me?

Dr. Dick Solomon: Mary, there's something I have to tell you. I come
  from another world.
Dr. Mary Albright: And this is news?

Dr. Dick Solomon: The ceremony begins with the bride being given

Sally Solomon: Excuse me? Given away? Like an object? As in 'free
  girl with every large fries'.
Tommy Solomon: Hey, there are free girls? Can I go?
Harry Solomon: Fries? Can I go?

Dr. Dick Solomon: Now, which one of those guys is God?
Dr. Mary Albright: Will you be quiet?
Dr. Dick Solomon: Okay, but be sure to introduce me later, because I
  want some answers.

Dr. Dick Solomon: Nina, are you married?
Nina Campbell: No.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Well, why not? What are you doing wrong?
Nina Campbell: You sound just like my mother.
Dr. Dick Solomon: That must be very confusing for you.

[Dick is clutching a toaster at the wedding]
Dr. Mary Albright: Where did you get that?
Dr. Dick Solomon: It was in the room full of prizes.

Dr. Dick Solomon: So, how was school today?
Tommy Solomon: The best ever. I had my very first make-out session.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Good for you.
Tommy Solomon: It was with Dina, my lab partner.
Sally Solomon: Dina, the one with the--?
Tommy Solomon: [slyly] Oh, yeah.
Dr. Dick Solomon: Tell us everything, I want details.
Tommy Solomon: At first, I was conflicted. We come from very
  different backgrounds. I'm and alien and she's a Presbyterian. I
  have a highly developed mind and she's got that... big, pouty
  mouth. I tell you, Dick, it was a tough decision.
Sally Solomon: What tipped the scales?
Tommy Solomon: She let me.
Dr. Dick Solomon: What happened next?
Tommy Solomon: Well, I don't know what came over me, but... they were
  so big and round and beautiful... I just had to touch them.
Dr. Dick Solomon: And then what?
Tommy Solomon: She screamed "Ow, my eyes!" and that just basically
  killed the mood.

  these studying materials and just come back when you're ready?
Dr. Dick Solomon: No no, I'm ready now. I've lied on my tax returns,
  I've been arrested, and I don't vote. I'm a true American. Test me
  now!
Mr. Barnes: Okay. Question 1: How is the president of the United
  States elected?

Student: How did it end?
Officer Don: The guy got away.
[students groan dejectedly]
Officer Don: But, I rolled my car!
[students cheer]

Jonesy: Why don't you just let me go?
Officer Don: Because I know you did it, Jonesy. You jumped the fence
  and you stole the money.
Jonesy: But you've got no proof. Besides, I couldn't have jumped the
  fence. It's physically impossible.
Dick: Physically impossible? That's where you're wrong! You may not
  have much respect for the law, Jonesy, but there's one law that you
  can't break: Coulomb's Third Law of Universal Gravitation!
Jonesy: What?
Dick: It states that the force between two objects is proportional to
  the algebraic products of their respective charges, as well as
  proportional to the inverse square of the distance between them.
  But of course, you knew that, didn't you, Jonesy?
Jonesy: Not all of it.
Dick: [illustrating on a dry-erase board] You're object "X" and the
  fence is object "Y". Now, where "V" is the velocity of the two
  objects and "R" is the distance between them and "E" is a unit
  vector directed from the first object to the second, we see that
  the fence proved little challenge.
Jonesy: Well, I guess.
Dick: You guess... I bet you guess! And so we see that X equals zero
  as Y approaches infinity. That's how you avoided the security
  camera. That's how you managed to get back over the fence. That's
  how they found you exactly 1.3 miles from the crime scene proving
  that you and only you could have perpetrated this heinous crime!
  [slaps the board] There's the proof!
Jonesy: Okay! Okay! Okay, you got me, I did it! I did it! My god,
  what kind of cop are you?
Dick: I'm not a cop. I'm a physics professor!

Dick: Using Coulomb's Third Law, I was able to prove that he did it.
Tommy: What does that have to do with it?
Dick: Nothing. All I proved was that he's rotating around the sun,
  but he didn't know that. That's the wonderful thing about physics,
  nobody understands it.
Sally: So you can use your knowledge to bully people into submission.
Dick: That's the plan. As long as America's educational system
  remains woefully inadequate, I rule!

  of what the est Training could do? Who else but Werner Erhard, a
  man some of his employees say, thought of himself, as god.

Werner Erhard: I didn't arrive at the opportunity to make the world
  work for everyone by figuring out how to do it! Don't you get that
  nothing transformational occurs that way!


# "60 Minutes" (1979)
Herself - Reporter: [Tracey Curro interviews Pauline Hanson in 1997]

# "7 numara" (2000)
Haydar: zero is not a value. It's not a number even. However it
  creates a value when it's near a number, like love, passion. Love
  is also worthless alone. There must be somebody. As more zero
  added, the number gets more value. As there's more passion, love
  gets bigger. imagine somebody says: take my love, add it to
  yourself, multiply with a lifetime and equal it to the infinty".
  Will the value be zero again for you?


# "77 Sunset Strip" (1958) {88 Bars (#6.7)}

# "7th Heaven" (1996)
Eric: A mother feeding her child is the most beautiful picture in the
  world.
Annie: Do you have any idea how much this hurts?

Ruthie: You're the worst babysitter I ever had.
Simon: That's not what you said two hours ago.
Ruthie: Yeah, well that was before you made me wear the staircase.

Mary: Is there a law against beating up you brother? Cause I swear,
  I'll get arrested.

[about Simon]
Annie: As soon as I get some rest, the little blond boy is mine.

Ruthie: Bad words make me sound bad.
Simon: No, bad words make you sound stupid.

Ruthie: You two better not make a lot of noise and wreck my date.
Simon: It's not a date, it's a play date. You're eight. I'm going on
  a date.
Annie: It's not a date, you're twelve. It's a birthday dinner.

[Annie is showing Ruthie her baby book]
Annie: See my tummy? That's you.
Ruthie: Maybe I never should have come out.
Annie: But... look what you would've missed... riding on Daddy's
  shoulders... and Simon rocking you on the front porch... and
  Mary... giving you a bath in the kitchen sink.
Ruthie: My butt was a lot smaller then.
Annie: All of our... bottoms were a lot smaller then.

[During labor]
Annie: Give me your hand.
Eric: Why? Are you hurting?
Annie: [sarcastically] No. I'm feeling... romantic.

Simon: How ya doing, kid?
Lucy: Get out of my face.
Simon: You're okay.

Ruthie: I'm going to be an inferior decorator.

Ruthie: Do you have to have special clothes to feel special? I just
  put on a clean pair of underwear and I feel great.

Simon: We're all just pawns being manipulated by the corruption of
  politics and big business anyway. Knowing about our health and
  environment, we just make bigger gas guzzling SUV's, package the...
  the food in plastic which leaches poisons into our bodies, sell
  arms to other countries, then declare war on them because they use
  them, and make paper towels and tissue? That'll only promote waste.

[Eric is tucking his youngest sons in to bed]
Eric: I love you guys.
Sam: I love Spiderman.
David: I love Batman.
Eric: I love Batman too.
Sam: What about Spiderman?
Eric: I love him too.
David: Which do you love more?
Eric: ...Batman.
David: Why?
Eric: I have no idea. Good night boys.
[tucks the boys in and steps into the hall]
Eric: That was the best conversation I had all day.

Lucy Camden: You're right. They're not officially engaged, but if
  they get married before us, you're a dead man and they won't have
  to get me a jury because I'll proudly plead guilty.

Rev. Morgan Hamilton: We cannot fight hate with hate. What are we
  teaching our children today? That will make things better tomorrow?

Eric: There's always going to be somebody who'll try to take your
  dignity and self-esteem. Just never let them take your voice.

Annie: Ginger... somebody. What do you mean you don't know? How can
  you not know? How many "Ginger"s do you have there? Is there a
  "Ginger" convention in town or something?

Eric: Well, the wind is real, but you can't see the wind. You know,
  you can only see the leaves rustling in the trees. Pain is real but
  you can't see pain. You can only see tears. Happiness is real, but
  you can't see happiness. You can only see the smile on someone's
  face.

Jordan: My mom's not thrilled with the idea of teenagers of the
  opposite sex left together in a basement unchaperoned to sleep. I
  think it's ridiculous. No-one's going to do anything in a crowd,
  and if someone wants to have sex they're going to find a way. They
  don't have to go to a party to do it.

Annie: Teenagers.
Eric: Yeah, if you don't like their mood, wait 10 minutes.

Matt: This is Bernie, Mary Camden's attorney.
Credit Card Collector: Mary Camden can't afford to pay a $50 bill but
  she has an attorney?

Matt: I'm gonna be... a gynaecologist.
Annie: Well, he does love women.

Lucy Camden: I want to be a minister because I want to be like my
  dad. I want to do what he does, I want to be who he is in the
  community. I want to serve God and I want to serve mankind. And I
  believe that this is my purpose in life and I was guided to that
  purpose in a unique way, by being the daughter of a minister.

Eric: All right, Simon, I don't like what you have been doing. And
  it's really difficult to believe that after growing up in this
  family, you could just so easily abandon what you've been taught
  and what I think you believe and... I do love you, son, I do. I
  hate what you've been doing, but I love you.

Lucy Camden: I swear, you guys gossip more than old ladies.

Martin: Maybe someday I'll marry a girl with a lot of brothers and
  sisters.
Ruthie: Yeah, maybe you will.

Martin Brewer: Ruthie's like my sister.
Mac: Are you trying to convince me, or are you trying to convince
  yourself?

Annie: I'm losing a son-in-law whom I love and adore, and I'm
  getting... Rose?

Lucy Camden: I had no idea this was your life.
Mike Pierce: My life's just fine and you know why? I'm alive... and
  I'm grateful for every second of every day.

Simon: Hey, what's going on?
Ruthie: Go away.
Simon: Go away? Come on, it's... it's me, it's Simon... I'm your
  favorite sibling, I'm the guy you shared a room with, let me in...
  come on, Cecilia already won't talk to me, I can't take you not
  talking to me too.

Simon: Who do you think you are, grabbing the phone out of my hand
  like that?
Ruthie: Someone who needed to make a phone call and I made it, so you
  can have your stupid phone back.
Simon: Isn't it a rule in this house that we have to respect each
  other or at least pretend to respect each other?
Ruthie: Well, no one respects me. No one even pretends to.

Lucy Camden: This can't be happening. This can't be happening.
Mike Pierce: It is happening, wake up.

Ruthie: Good night, Simon, love you.
Simon: Yeah... I love you too... but you don't have to say it every
  night.

Lucy: What kind of name is 'Joy' anyway?
Mary: The kind of name that explains the look on Robbie's face.

Annie: You may be weird, but at least you'll all be my honest little
  weirdos.

Mary: Cheese covers a myriad of sins.

[the boys are talking to Annie]
Sam: I got a cookie under my pillow.
David: I already ate mine.
Annie: Why would you put a cookie under your pillow? Is it because
  there's no place in the kitchen to put your cookies?
David: No, it's for emergencies.

[Eric to Annie]
Eric: Are you aware that our living room is filled with children who
  don't belong to us?

[Rabbi Glass telling Matt about his worst argument with Rosina]
Rabbi Richard Glass: Let me tell you something, man, those were the
  worst four minutes of my life.

Rev. Camden: You know what the scariest thing in my life is?
Simon: Those bowling shoes?

[Ben is reading Lucy's diary]
Kevin Kinkirk: So, you're snooping in the name of God?

Ruthie: Nice duds. Does Santa know you stole his elfs' pajamas?

Eric: You, Lucy Camden, are an outstanding person. And if they gave
  out an award for the best in the human race, you would win it year
  after year.

Eric: If you'll excuse me, I have to put my head through a wall.

Lucy Camden: Sunday is not the new Saturday night.

Sam Camden: I wanna see Lucy bein' a preacher.

[Ben is talking to Ruthie on the phone]
Ruthie: My parents can't get divorced, you big ape, I won't let them!

Matt: The only thing worse than a lecture from Dad...
Mary: ...is a lecture from the Colonel.

Kevin: She's crazy.
Sam, David: *Cra-zy*.
Kevin: But I love her.
Sam, David: We love her too.

Lucy Camden: I told you something bad was going to happen. When she's
  in the middle of her crab legs, it'll suddenly occur to her that
  Chandler is not the guy for her and she'll find us and... Oh my
  God. She said he was going to ask her to marry him. Ugh. I hate
  her. I hate him too. They don't even know each other. Kevin and I
  know each other. We're in love with each other. We should be
  getting engaged tonight. Not them. I may look like the crazy
  person, but they're the crazy people. Crazy people who are going to
  get married before I do. When I see Kevin, he is so going to get a
  piece of my heart. He probably knows Chandler is going to propose
  to her and that's why he is being nice and going through all this
  trouble.

Jimmy Moon: Are you crazy?
Lucy Camden: Crazy like a fox, my friend.

[about Ben's girlfriends]
Kevin Kinkirk: There's always something wrong with the girls you
  pick.
Ben Kinkirk: What about Mary?
Kevin Kinkirk: I rest my case.

Kevin Kinkirk: Lucy Camden, will you marry me?
Lucy Camden: [to God] Thank you. [to Kevin] Yes, Kevin Kinkirk, I
  will marry you.

Eric: You expect me to believe that you have to choose between family
  and that low life, cradle-robbing sky jockey?

Annie: Who is in the hospital?
Eric: The hospitalized.

Roxanne Richardson: Aren't you ministers supposed to preach
  forgiveness?
Lucy Camden: I'm not a minister yet, I don't preach anything.

Annie: I need to talk to you in the living room.
Sam: You're in trouble. Tell her you're sorry and you'll never do it
  again.
Eric: I don't think that will work for me.
David: Tell her Happy did it.
Eric: I don't think that will work for me either.

[Eric is telling Annie about the nightmare he had]
Eric: I was marrying Kevin and Lucy in my underwear.

Eric: Don't try to ruin a perfectly good night of spying on the kids
  with logic.

Annie: You want a piece of me? I brought seven kids into this world,
  I can take one out.

Lucy: If you ever want to make detective, you have to be a whole lot
  nosier.

Simon: What's for breakfast?
Annie: Any cereal in the cupboard you want.

Annie: The fact that my kid is more concerned with the punishment
  than the crime tells me something. And you know what it tells me?
  My kid is a weenie.
Mary: So I guess I'm grounded for life?
Annie: That's a given.

Simon: [to Deena] What about Ruthie as Maid of Honor?
Ruthie: No thanks. I don't want to be anyone's maid. I don't clean
  good. No elbow power.

[Eric and Annie are taking Ruthie into school for her first day of
  Kindergarten]
Ruthie: You took him?
Eric: We took all of you.
Ruthie: He told me he took a cab and paid for it all by himself.
Eric: Cabs are very cheap on Planet Simon.

Kevin Kinkirk: So what if Lucy is stubborn and slightly insane.

Ruthie: You've got money, you've got new clothes, and women are
  unexplainably attracted to you. Are you Spiderman or something?

Eric: Do you want me to help?
Simon: Do I want you to help me? Of course, I want you to help me.
  But you can't. I have to be a grown up tonight.

[about himself to a patient]
Matt: The vampire returns...

Simon: Ruthie... how ya doing?
Ruthie: Fine, how are you doing?
Simon: Fine... but I'm not in school.
Ruthie: ...bye.
Simon: Wait... how is school?
Ruthie: Fine, except for algerbra.
Simon: You're lying... no one said anything to you about me?
Ruthie: Well, why would they?
Simon: Becase I'm your brother and... the kid on the bike was your
  age.
Ruthie: He didn't go to my school.
Simon: Look, you don't have to protect me. I have it easier than you,
  I'm not in school.
Ruthie: [hugs him] Simon, no one has it harder than you.

Mary: Why can't you talk to me?
Wilson West: No offense, but you're not in the club.

Mary: HELLO-MY-NAME-IS-MARY.
Eric: Mary, he's French, not deaf.

Eric: You know in some ways your mother hasn't changed since the day
  I married her over twenty years ago.
Matt: And in other ways?
Eric: She's mean. Really, really mean.

Simon: I guess my inner voice was telling me... you're going to hell
  anyway for killing that guy... so I might as well have sex.

Ruthie: [to Robbie and Lucy] By the power invested in me, in *me*, I
  now pronounce you a couple. You may now kiss you ex-girlfriend's
  sister. You know, you guys should really go on a talk show.

Gladys Bink: They're all nuts!

Annie: There is one thing I've noticed about teenage boys from
  watching your sisters, and that is they all come back. Sooner or
  later, all of them come back.

Lucy Camden: [to Kevin about Roxanne and Chandler dating] This is all
  your fault! You brought home that...
[Kevin clamps his hand over her mouth]
Chandler Hampton: Surely you don't think Roxanne is what you were
  just about to call her?
Kevin Kinkirk: No, she doesn't.
Lucy Camden: [at the same time] Yes, I do.

Matt: [to Kevin] Consider this your initiation in to the Camden
  family. It's one thing to give my sister a ring, marry her and
  father a child. It's another thing, a better thing to join her
  brother in a good old-fashioned family caper.

Lucy: Today, I am not your daughter, your sister or your wife, I am
  Lucy Kinkirk. The Reverend Lucy Kinkirk.

Lucy: Is there anything you want to tell me?
Simon: Aren't you that Camden who finds out everything last? You
  know, 'cause if I change something as basic to the family structure
  as that, this family might just fall apart.
Lucy: I doubt it.

Matt: Come on! We can't have a caper like that and keep secrets from
  each other. Come on! We're brothers.

Chandler Hampton: Female logic is fascinating.

Martin Brewer: I made a mistake. A big mistake.
Beau: Everyone makes mistakes.
Martin Brewer: Not like this one... I got a girl pregnant and I'm
  gonna be a father.

Lucy: [after seeing Sandy's mother and stepfather] I think I liked
  the drunk father better.
Eric: He certainly was warmer.

Ruthie: Martin Brewer loves me, finally.

Ruthie: I don't think I'll be wearing this hat any more.
Simon: [completely unaware that his sister dropped it in the toilet]
  Hey, I'll take it.
Ruthie: Okay.

Simon: Okay, okay I'm flexible.

Guy: Stupid Americans.
Eric, Annie, Ruthie, Simon, Mary, Lucy, Matt: [all at same time] We
  heard that!

[Eric is banging his head against the wall]
Annie: Could you not do that, honey? I don't have time to plaster.

Matt: What's wrong with Luce?
Mary: God hates her.
Matt: Still? You'd think after 13 years he'd move on to someone else.

[as Eric bangs his head into a wall during a visit from both of their
  parents]
Annie: Honey, honey, not now. I don't have time to plaster.

[as Annie bangs her head into a wall after being told her father is
  remarrying]
Eric: Honey, honey, not now. I-I don't know how to plaster.

[to her friend after agreeing with Eric to a subtle approach]
Gladys Bink: You are such a liar! [Eric looks dumbfounded] Subtle
  never really worked for me.


# "7th Heaven" (1996) {...And Expiation (#4.8)}
Mary Camden: We trashed the school gym.
Lucy Camden: What? Who?
Mary Camden: Some of the girls from the team and me.
Lucy Camden: Why?
Mary Camden: I don't know. We were just eating and talking about the
  team lockout and it just happened.
Lucy Camden: And you got busted?
Mary Camden: Yeah, we must've set off an alarm or something 'cause
  the cops showed up.
Lucy Camden: What's gonna happen?
Mary Camden: I don't know. Sgt. Michaels saids I need a lawyer.
Lucy Camden: This is unreal.
Mary Camden: I wish.

Sgt. Michaels: [about Mary] If you need any help trying to find a
  lawyer...
Annie Camden: What?
Sgt. Michaels: We're releasing her without bail on your recoginance,
  but this isn't over. She's... you're gonna need a lawyer.

Annie Camden: What are we gonna do?
Rev. Eric Camden: Call around. Find a lawyer, I guess. I didn't see
  this one coming.
Annie Camden: Not this, no. Not in a million years.

Mary Camden: What if I get expelled?
Rev. Eric Camden: Well, we'll just have to wait and see what happens,
  and then deal with it.
Mary Camden: I know, I blew it, but up until now, I've been a pretty
  good kid. Now it's gone. It's all gone. Who knew that one mistake
  could ruin your whole life?
Annie Camden: Your dad and I... when you're an adult, you know that
  one mistake can ruin your life. Your life's not ruined. It's going
  to be radically different, but only you can decide if that's going
  to be a good different or bad different.

Mary Camden: Um, I just got off the phone with Mr. Wolf. Um, Mr. Wolf
  from the group that gave me the scholarship. Apparently, word of
  what happened has gotten around, and in light of everything that's
  gone on, including me recent subpar academic performance, Mr. Wolf
  said the committee felt there were better candidates out there for
  the limited funds that they have to donate, for college next year.
  I lost my scholarship.

Mary Camden: I knew the choices I was making was wrong and I did it
  anyway... and I am sorry. I am sorry that I did it, and I am sorry
  for the way I've been acting, and I am sorry for everything that
  everyone has gone through because of me. And it kills me to know
  that sorry doesn't make a difference, and that it doesn't undo what
  I did, and it doesn't make my family like me again.
Rev. Eric Camden: Hold on...
Mary Camden: Look, I know you love me. But how could you like me? I
  don't even like myself, and I don't know what to do to make things
  better

Mary Camden: Okay, this isn't your fault, or your fault, or yours. I
  knew the choice I was making was wrong, and I did it anyway.


# "7th Heaven" (1996) {...And a Nice Chianti (#3.5)}
Sheila: [approaches Lucy angrily with two other girls] Hey, Camden,
  you better meet me by the bus after school.
Lucy Camden: I'm not meeting anyone anywhere.
Sheila: Okay, but if I were you, I wouldn't plan on taking the bus
  this afternoon.
Lucy Camden: You know, I don't like being threatened.
Sheila: Oh yeah? And what are you gonna do about it?
Lucy Camden: I don't know, but you can all stop following me around,
  because I'm older than you are, I'm smarter than you are, and I'm
  tougher than you are!
Sheila: No, you're not.
Lucy Camden: Okay. [pauses] Well, my sister is. So just watch it, the
  three of you!

Mary Camden: Upstairs. The three of you. We need to talk.
Ruthie: Who squealed?
Simon Camden: It wasn't me.
Ruthie: Lucy. Big surprise. Hey, where's the pregnant chick who stole
  Matt's car?
Annie Camden: Kitchen. And show some respect.

Annie Camden: Wait a minute. Why are you all together? What happened
  to the bus?
Lucy Camden: I just change my mind, that's all. Too many freshmen.
Simon Camden: Actually, I was going to walk home today, but I lucked
  out when Mary saw me and stopped to pick me up. By the way, she's
  not such a bad driver when Dad's in the car, you guys may want to
  take that under consideration.

Annie Camden: Hi.
Rev. Eric Camden: Annie, this is Theresa. Theresa's the one who
  "borrowed" Matt's car.
Annie Camden: Pleased to meet you. Looks like we have something in
  common.
Rev. Eric Camden: We called Theresa's parents, they're gonna come
  over later.
Annie Camden: Do they know? Not to worry, Eric's very good at talking
  to parents about everything it'll be okay.
Rev. Eric Camden: Uh honey, I was just kind of thinking that maybe
  you'd be the best person to talk to them.

Mary Camden: I got it! I got my learner's permit. And Dad got me my
  own set of keys. Congratulate me!
Lucy Camden, Simon Camden: Congratulations.
Ruthie: Ditto.

Lucy Camden: [to Mary] No, it's not you. It's not your driving I'm
  afraid of. It's Mom. I don't want to be seen with her, especially
  at school, and neither do Simon and Ruthie. If you hadn't gotten
  your learner's permit, we wouldn't even be in this situation.
Mary Camden: What are you talking about?
Lucy Camden: Look, it's bad enough that Mom and Dad are all over each
  other in the house day in, day out, but this is like taking it to
  the streets... our streets, our schools, in front of our friends.
  Mom is a walking advertisement that those two can't keep their
  hands off each other and consequently, there are about to be seven
  of us. Seven! I'm surprised the zero population growth people
  haven't shown up at our door and dragged the two of them off to
  some seminar.
Mary Camden: I hope Sheila beats the snot out of you.

Annie Camden: Lunches are on the kitchen counter. Don't worry. This
  bus thing won't last long.
Mary Camden: I hope they really hate it and they want a ride home
  today, but you punish them by making them take the bus for weeks
  and even months.
Ruthie: Punish me, Mommy, punish me.

Mary Camden: [to her siblings] You know, it's one thing to criticize
  Mom and Dad for the way they act, or the way they dress, but it's
  another thing to criticize them because they're having a couple
  little babies. I mean, those babies deserve all the love and
  respect we can give them, because that's all Mom and Dad have ever
  given us.

Stevie Stevenson: You've got two choices, Camden. A screamin' wedgie,
  or a long walk home.
Marvin: I'd choose the long walk home. And I'm speaking from
  experience.

Mary Camden: [about Ruthie wearing a helmet] That's not funny.
Ruthie: What's not funny? Who's trying to be funny?
Mary Camden: I'm a very good driver.
Ruthie: I'm sure you are.
Mary Camden: Then take the helmet off.
Ruthie: It's not a helmet, it's a sports hat, kinda like a baseball
  cap, only for football, and it matches my shirt.
Mary Camden: Give me a break. Take it off.

Mary Camden: I'm am an official licensed driver!
Matt Camden: Chauffeur. Licensed chauffeur.
Rev. Eric Camden: And it's not a license, it's a learners permit.
  Learner being the key word here.
Annie Camden: That's right. Wherever you go, I shall go with you.
Mary Camden: I don't care! I'm driving! And I am the greatest driver
  in all the world!
Matt Camden: Nightmare.

Lucy Camden: [to Rachel] Okay. You... be quiet for a second and
  listen to me! [to Sarah] And you! well, you like adults. And I'm an
  adult... a very tired adult, who's tired of having to listen to you
  and Rachel fight. I need a time-out, an adult time-out, which can
  only happen if you both go home. Now. Right away. I will call your
  parents and tell them whatever you want me to tell them, but please
  just go home! I promise that Ruthie will have you both over
  again... separately!

Lucy Camden: [to Sarah and Rachel] Okay, I have been listening to you
  two all day, and a couple of things are clear. You both like
  Ruthie, and you both have a different relationship with Ruthie...
  which happens. Different people see different things in you, and
  they bring out different qualities, and...
Rachel: No offense, but if I wanted an after-school special lecture,
  I'd turn on my TV.

Julie Camden Hastings: I don't know if I believe Mary.
Dr. Hank Hastings: I think we should tell Eric and Annie about her -
  about the beer, and that she's still hanging out with Frankie.
Julie Camden Hastings: I hate to get her in trouble. If this were an
  isolated incident... she wasn't drunk. She could be telling the
  truth
Dr. Hank Hastings: But if she is in trouble, and we don't say
  anything, how are we going to feel later... that we knew she was in
  trouble, and we did nothing?

Lucy Camden: Why don't you girls go outside and play, and I'll set us
  up a picnic lunch?
Rachel: I don't like eating outside. It's a bug thing.
Lucy Camden: Okay... well, then, we'll have a picnic indoors.
Sarah: With orange soda?
Rachel: I don't like orange soda, and neither does Ruthie.
Sarah: Ruthie likes orange soda.
Lucy Camden: Who wants a cookie?
Rachel: Ruthie's my best friend, and I think I know if she likes
  orange soda!
Sarah: She was my best friend first.
Rachel: But you obviously don't know her as well as I do!
Sarah: Yes, I do.
Rachel: No, you don't!
Lucy Camden: Really. Taste a cookie. They're still warm.
Rachel: What's Ruthie's favorite color?
Sarah: Purple.
Rachel: Blue! What does she want to be when she grows up?
Sarah: A vet.
Rachel: Queen Elizabeth! See, I told you that you didn't know her. I
  know her. She's my best friend!

Julie Camden Hastings: This was a mistake. I'm never leaving Erica
  again, ever!
Mary Camden: Please don't say that.
Dr. Hank Hastings: We come home, the house is a mess, the baby is a
  mess, there's another baby here we don't even know. You had guests
  over after we told you not to, and you were drinking. What is wrong
  with you?

Annie Jackson-Camden: [to Frankie] What are you doing?
Frankie: What do you mean?
Annie Jackson-Camden: What are you doing with that man?
Frankie: Look, Johnny is a great husband and father.
Annie Jackson-Camden: He tried to hit you. He would have hit you if
  my husband hadn't stepped in.
Frankie: But I love him, okay?
Annie Jackson-Camden: Do you love Mercy?
Frankie: Of course I love her!
Annie Jackson-Camden: Then why do you keep putting her at risk? If
  Johnny had hit you, or if someone had called the police, you and
  Johnny would be in jail right now. If that happened, then what
  would happen to Mercy?

Frankie: [to Mary] I came all this way to beg you in person. Please
  watch Mercy. Please. Be my friend, and do me this one favor. I just
  need an hour, and your sister said your aunt and uncle would be
  gone all day. [pauses] I think Johnny's cheating on me. I want to
  follow him - catch him in the act. And I can't do that unless you
  watch Mercy.
Mary Camden: [hesitates] One hour, right?
Frankie: Two hours max.
Mary Camden: Please don't blow this.
Frankie: I won't. I won't. I'll just go get Mercy.
Mary Camden: You left her in the car?
Frankie: I rolled the window down. Man... you're the best friend
  ever. [leaves]
Mary Camden: Yeah, or the stupidest friend ever.

Mary Camden: The beer isn't mine, it's Frankie's. Frankie drank it.
Dr. Hank Hastings: That's your defense: "the beer belongs to my
  pot-smoking friend?" How stupid do you think we are?
Julie Camden Hastings: Let's just forget the fact that I'm a
  recovering alcoholic, and that any trace of alcohol in my house
  doesn't exactly make me happy. Let's assume that you're telling the
  truth - it's not your beer. Let's talk about how you, my underage
  niece, happens to have be involved with an underage friend who has
  beer. What's happened to you? Who are you?

Simon Camden: [about his earring] But if I take it out, the hole will
  close up!
Reverend Eric Camden: Exactly!
Simon Camden: That's not fair. Why can't I keep the earring?
Ruthie Camden: Because you look like a girl!
Annie Jackson-Camden: You went out of the house tonight without our
  permission. You went to the house of someone we don't know and have
  never met. At that house you allowed that someone we don't know to
  pierce your ear.
Reverend Eric Camden: Be grateful that the only thing we're doing is
  making you take out your earring out.
Simon Camden: Fine!

Lucy Camden: [to Eric] I'm sorry about tonight. I was trying to watch
  everyone and I shouldn't have let Simon sneak out of the house
Reverend Eric Camden: It's not your fault you weren't in charge of
  Simon. Simon is in charge of Simon.

Frankie: [to Annie] Are you actually suggesting that I leave Johnny?
  I can't raise a kid on my own.
Annie Jackson-Camden: You can't stay with a man who hits you. You
  can't. Mercy will grow up thinking that's what women do: they get
  hit. Is that what you want to teach her?

Annie Jackson-Camden: Great husbands don't smoke pot, cheat, hit
  their wives. Open your eyes, Frankie, and see who you're really
  married to before it's too late.

Simon Camden: [to Mary when she wants to borrow money] No, no, no!
Mary Camden: I will drive you on dates or anywhere you want to go.
Simon Camden: Your car seats two. Where's my date supposed to sit, in
  the trunk?

Simon Camden: What are we gonna do about this?
Lucy Camden: We're gonna let Mary handle it. It's her problem, not
  ours.
Ruthie Camden: Please don't let them put Mary in jail again.
Simon Camden: You say to let Mary handle it, but she's not. We're the
  ones getting the calls, and sooner or later Mom and Dad are gonna
  find out. And deadbeat or not, she's still our sister.

Lucy Camden: [to Mary] See, the trick isn't getting the job, it's
  keeping the job.
Mary Camden: Why are you so snotty?
Lucy Camden: Considering I spent the day dodging creditors and
  breaking into piggy banks, I think I'm entitled to be a little
  snotty.

Rev. Eric Camden: [about Mary] You know, she quit her job at the pool
  hall, she quit her job at Pete's Pizza. She doesn't have any
  friends... well, not any good ones. She needs a job.
Annie Camden: Yes, Mary needs a job, and money, and friends... good
  ones. But she has bills to pay. She also needs to take a job to pay
  those bills. And the job she takes probably won't be a job she
  loves or even likes. And then she'll see how important it is to
  have a job you love. And jobs people love usually involve training
  and/or education. That will force her to set goals and move
  forward.
Rev. Eric Camden: Are you just going to will her into this
  realization?
Annie Camden: She's not on our schedule. We need to give her time.
  She'll realize it when she realizes it.
Rev. Eric Camden: In the meantime, no job plus no money equals no
  car, right? I mean, if she can't pay for the car, she'll lose it.
Annie Camden: So let her lose the car.
Rev. Eric Camden: This isn't about losing Mary's car. This is about
  losing Mary!
Annie Camden: You think I don't know that? You know, just because I'm
  not a minister or a therapist doesn't mean I don't know when she's
  in trouble. I'm her mother! And I think she needs to be the one to
  ask for help, and she's not ready yet!
Rev. Eric Camden: Well, I'm her father, and I say she needs help now,
  whether she asks for it or not!
Annie Camden: What you mean to say is that you're the expert, and
  what you say goes!

Simon Camden: This isn't Mary. I'm her brother Simon.
Credit Card Collector: Well, when Mary gets in, would you tell her
  that if she doesn't pay these bills immediately, we will involve
  the local authorities
Simon Camden: Wait, you mean the police?
Credit Card Collector: Yes. You can't just charge for merchandise and
  not pay your bills; there are laws. And if we have to, we'll
  enforce those laws to recoup our losses.

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {Help! (#5.2)}
Matt Camden: I'm gonna study. I just couldn't this afternoon because
  every time I looked up from my book, I noticed how dirty the
  kitchen was.
John Hamilton: Well, an unclean kitchen never bothered you before.
Matt Camden: Well, it did today, and you know, I hate to mention it,
  but if you had cleaned your breakfast dishes from this morning, I
  wouldn't have wasted my entire afternoon taking care of that little
  chore for you.
John Hamilton: [stunned] Are you trying to blame me for you not
  studying? So you failed your organic chemistry pre-test because of
  Heather, and you didn't study this afternoon because I didn't do
  the dishes, and you're not studying now because your mom didn't do
  your laundry? [Matt nods] I'm just curious. Now, if you don't pass
  your chemistry midterm and get kicked out of pre-med, who are you
  gonna blame? Me? Heather? Your mom? The Colonel? The man on the
  moon? Problems in the Middle East? Global warming? What?
Matt Camden: I don't know what you're so upset about. I'm gonna do
  fine on my midterm.
John Hamilton: But if you don't, it won't be your fault, right?
Matt Camden: Look, you don't understand.
John Hamilton: No, I think that you don't understand organic
  chemistry, among other things, and you're too pigheaded to admit
  it, and instead of just asking for help or saying "I need help",
  you're blaming everyone and everything, as long as it doesn't allow
  you to blame yourself.
Matt Camden: You are totally out of line.
John Hamilton: I don't think I am.
Matt Camden: Do you get good grades?
John Hamilton: [smiles proudly] Yes, I do.
Matt Camden: And? [pauses, doesn't know what to say] That's because I
  do everything around here, and you do nothing! [storms out]

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Ruthie] Actually, your principal called this
  morning, and you're not in any trouble. He thinks he may have found
  a way to get you out of Miss Riddle's class.
Ruthie Camden: Thank God!
Rev. Eric Camden: What did you say?
Ruthie Camden: Thank God. You should thank God. I talked to God and
  told him how unhappy I was at school, and asked Him to help.
Rev. Eric Camden: You prayed to get out of Miss Riddle's class?
Ruthie Camden: If you don't ask, you don't get. I just thought you
  and Mom could use some help.

Mary Camden: [on the phone with insurance people] I am begging you,
  please don't cancel my policy... I know, but I got fired, and you
  have to give me more than a couple of days to come up with the
  money... I can't drive my car without insurance! Don't you get it?
  No car equals no job. I have to have insurance!... look, you can
  tell whomever you want that you're cancelling my insurance, but you
  can't stop me from driving my own car... oh yeah? Watch me! [slams
  phone down]

Ruthie Camden: [to her parents as they are visiting Eleanor Roosevelt
  School] They have horses! Horses!
Mrs. Carmen Mackoul: [to Eric and Annie] The school offers both
  English and western style instruction.2
Ruthie Camden: And there's no homework!
Mrs. Carmen Mackoul: We feel the children work hard during the day.
  At night, they should be free to relax and be kids. After all, we
  do have them seven hours a day. Of course, if Ruthie would like to
  spend time at home studying any subject beyond the core curriculum,
  we'll set up an individual program for her.
Ruthie Camden: I may want to do that, considering I don't have to be
  at school until ten!
Mrs. Carmen Mackoul: [laughs] We have a flexible schedule. Students
  can start as late as ten, but then they go until five. Not every
  student does his or her best work early in the morning. Plus, we
  have a 14 to 1 student ratio and a whole list of after-school trips
  and projects. Last year, we took a group of students to the
  National Gallery in Washington, D.C. and met the President. I think
  that Ruthie would make a wonderful addition to our school. If you
  have any questions, please call.
Rev. Eric Camden, Annie Camden: Thank you. [shakes her hand]
Mrs. Carmen Mackoul: Bye, Ruthie. [leaves]
Ruthie Camden: Boy, when God answers a prayer, he answers a prayer!
Rev. Eric Camden: Does that mean you want to go to school here?
Annie Camden: Oh, yeah!

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Annie] You know, at first I wasn't thrilled
  with you going back to college, but you going to school isn't about
  for me, its about you. You do so much for me and the kids and the
  church. It's your turn to do something for yourself.
Annie Camden: Boy, what a difference a week makes!
Rev. Eric Camden: Well, what kind of husband would I be if I didn't
  support you 100% by helping out with the house and kids?
Annie Camden: A jerk.
Rev. Eric Camden: Exactly, so keep studying.

Ruthie Camden: [to Eric] So did you get me transferred out of Miss
  Riddle's class?
Rev. Eric Camden: Yeah. I think I did.
Ruthie Camden: You and God make a great team!

Lucy Camden: [to Ruthie] If you got into that school, you should be
  honored. You should go.
Ruthie Camden: No, I will not go! You cannot make me! I'm just going
  to run away.
Lucy Camden: If you run away, you'll still have to make all new
  friends.
Ruthie Camden: No, I won't. My friend Sarah will come with me and
  we'll join the circus, and when we're old enough we'll marry
  clowns!
Lucy Camden: You have put way too much thought into this whole thing.
Ruthie Camden: Why has God forsaken me? Why?

Rev. Eric Camden: [about Mary to the Colonel] Look, Annie and I
  aren't happy that she's not going to college, but she's working.
  She's earning a living, paying her bills.
John 'The Colonel' Camden: Who let her buy the car?
Rev. Eric Camden: No one let her. She just went out and bought it.
  And as much as I think she shouldn't have, that car is a
  responsibility that she can't run away from. She has to work hard
  and and keep her job because she has to pay for that car.
John 'The Colonel' Camden: Son, to win a war you've got to fight. You
  got to get in there and get your hands dirty and make something
  happen, and you have to have a battle plan. What's your battle
  plan?
Rev. Eric Camden: This isn't a war.
John 'The Colonel' Camden: Oh, it's a war all right, and a stake is
  Mary's future.
Rev. Eric Camden: As much as we would like to force Mary into doing
  what we know is best for her, we can't. She's an adult. She has to
  do this on her own.
John 'The Colonel' Camden: And what if she doesn't?
Rev. Eric Camden: She will.

Professor Townsend: [to Matt's college class] Here's the good news.
  This was just a practice test to help you prepare for the midterm.
  It doesn't count. Here's the bad news. Half of you didn't pass. The
  other half barely passed. Oh, here's some more bad news. The
  midterm is in two weeks, so if you don't know the material by now,
  when are you going to learn it? What does this all mean? For those
  of you who are taking organic chemistry as a requirement for
  pre-med, you may want to double major in pre-law, because if you
  don't understand chemistry, you're going to be a doctor who's gonna
  need a lawyer. Just wanting to be a doctor isn't good enough. You
  have to study hard, you have to work hard, and you have to get
  through this class. Class is dismissed... for some of you, I think
  permanently!


# "7th Heaven" (1996) {Here We Go Again (#5.1)}
Mary Camden: Yes, I'm starting a new job today.
Rev. Eric Camden: You've had a new job every week this summer.
Mary Camden: That's not true. I was a day camp counselor for almost
  three weeks.
Rev. Eric Camden: [sarcastically] You know, just because you're mad
  at Mom doesn't mean you have to take it out on me.
Rev. Eric Camden: I'm not angry, the world is angry... at your mom,
  and I'm not taking it out on anyone.

Mary Camden: Hello? Is anyone listening to me? I need a car!
Annie Camden: Hello! Earn money and buy one.
Mary Camden: You guys bought Matt a car. Why can't you buy me a car?
Annie Camden: Matt was going to college. You, on the other hand, are
  not going to college. You are working, so you can buy your own car.
  How much money have you saved this summer?
Mary Camden: Saved? On what I make? Please. You guys are forcing me
  to buy on credit, and you can stop talking about college, because
  I'm not going to college until I figure out what I'm going to
  college for.
Rev. Eric Camden: Well, maybe so you can earn a living and someday
  even have your own house, and your own car.
Mary Camden: Well, maybe I don't want to have my own house. You don't
  own this home; this is the Church's home.
Rev. Eric Camden: Yes, but this house is a benefit of my job, which I
  earned after five years of college and we do have a car. Two cars.
  Well, three if you count the one we bought for Matt, who's in
  college.

Ruthie Camden: [about her teacher] She's mean! She's really mean. And
  she makes me want to do something really, really bad.

Annie Camden: I've signed up for school today.
Rev. Eric Camden: What school?
Annie Camden: College, Crawford. I want to get my teaching
  credentials in early childhood education.
Rev. Eric Camden: Now? You do know that we have 7 kids now.
Annie Camden: We have the twins and Ruthie, but Simon starts high
  school tomorrow, Lucy graduates high school this year, Mary's out
  of high school and working and Matt is out on his own.
Rev. Eric Camden: Matt is hardly out on his own. He sleeps out on his
  own. He's still a kid.
Annie Camden: Oh stop it. He and Heather are practically married.
Rev. Eric Camden: No, they're not. That's just what we say to each
  other whenever we think those two might be shacking up. And Mary is
  going to college, she's going to go to college eventually... I
  hope, as soon as she figures out that she doesn't enjoy minimum
  wage jobs.
Annie Camden: Unfortunately, I think Mary is quite happy with her
  stint in the world of minimum wage.
Rev. Eric Camden: Well, I'm not happy with it. With my luck she'll
  probably decide to go to college when Lucy decides to go and with
  Matt's we'll have 3 tuitions to pay, oh plus yours. And by the way,
  who says that Lucy won't have the kind of senior year that Mary
  had. And Simon is starting high school. Do you remember what it was
  like when Matt started high school? High school boys are, well
  they're high school boys. And we shouldn't forget Ruthie, who is
  well on her way to being more difficult than all the other kids
  rolled into one. Oh and bonus, the twins are entering the terrible
  twos. They are not entering, they are there.
Annie Camden: So, what are you saying? That the family is so
  dangerous that I can't take 1 or 2 hours away from them to take one
  course? I'm going back to school!
Rev. Eric Camden: When were you going to tell me this, as you were
  backing out of the driveway tomorrow morning?
Annie Camden: No, I planned to tell you just when I told you.
Rev. Eric Camden: [sarcastic] Well, thank you Mrs. Camden!

Mary Camden: Look, if I never go to college are you really going to
  be this mad at me for the rest of my life?
Rev. Eric Camden: [Hugs her] Yes. Because you're too smart not to
  learn all you can as long as you can.

Simon Camden: So you were supposed to put tuna in it.
Lucy Camden: He's right. It was just the helper.
Mary Camden: [pauses] We were supposed to add the tuna?

Rev. Eric Camden: Simon, do not, under any circumstances, let Ruthie
  out of your sight. She's planning to run away.
Simon Camden: You do see that she's just crying out for attention,
  don't you?
Rev. Eric Camden: Yes, and your mother and I are doing everything we
  can to give her the attention that she needs, but our hands are
  kind of full right now, so we were hoping you could give her some
  of yours. Scratch that, a lot of yours. All of yours.
Simon Camden: Well, hey, I'm a team player.
Rev. Eric Camden: I'm delighted to hear it.

Rev. Eric Camden: Maybe I'll start dinner.
Annie Camden: No. Mary and Lucy can start dinner. You should try to
  grab a fifteen minute nap and then when I'm finished with the
  babies you can keep an eye on them while I get a shower and a nap
Rev. Eric Camden: I'm on my way.
Annie Camden: And Simon is on Ruthie duty until further notice.

Matt Camden: Sssshhh! You want Mom and Dad to hear you? They're
  waiting for us. You know they are. Waiting for someone to stop that
  incessant crying.
Lucy Camden: It never stops.
Matt Camden: Thus the word incessant.
Lucy Camden: We're trapped in our own home. Our hell home... sorry.
  Usually my brain self-censors, but I can't hear myself thinking.
Mary Camden: Okay, listen, we can use the crying for cover. If we
  sneak up into our rooms very, very quietly them Mom and Dad won't
  be able to hear for the screaming.

Shana Sullivan: What time do you get off?
Matt Camden: I just got fired. Isn't that great?

Mary Camden: What happened?
Lucy Camden: You made me lie to Mom and Dad! I lied and lied and
  lied. I wove a twisted web of lies and deceit and walked a
  tightrope on it all night long. Are they standing right behind me?

Annie Camden: [to Ruthie] Is that the new outfit that Grandpa and
  Ginger sent for the boys?
Ruthie: Is that what it is? I had no idea. Hmm. Guess it was just
  lying around somewhere.
Annie Camden: On the top shelf of the hall closet where we keep the
  rest of the baby gifts?

Annie Camden: Why isn't Simon watching Ruthie?
Ruthie: Is Simon my new mommy?

Ruthie: I don't care what anyone says about the twins. They're not
  cute.
Simon Camden: Well, of course they're not cute! Compared to you, who
  is?
Ruthie: I'm not buying it. Get away from me.
Simon Camden: Come on. If you come back in the house with me, I'll
  give you a cookie. Two cookies. Cookies and ice cream!... money?
  Cold, hard cash?
Ruthie: I liked you better when you ignored me.

Simon Camden: [about the twins' crying] You know, they could have
  colic. Results in constant, uncontrollable crying. It's enough to
  make any parent feel like a failure.
Annie Camden: [whispers to Eric] Make him leave.
Rev. Eric Camden: [to Simon] Colic doesn't generally come until after
  the first month, and before you go around making any more
  observations, why don't you take care of your sister and your dog
  like we asked you to, because one of them ran away and one of them
  peed on the kitchen floor.
Simon Camden: Fine. But it takes a village, my friend!

Matt Camden: [to Ruthie] Don't make me get Mom and Dad.
Ruthie: Ha! You couldn't get Mom and Dad away from the "Children of
  the Corn" if you tried!

Rev. Eric Camden: Two new babies and we still get to torture the
  other five. I told you this was gonna be fun.

Matt Camden: [to Ruthie] You, get out. I have burgers to deliver.
Ruthie: I love riding in a car full of hamburgers and french fries. I
  had a dream I did it once and I woke up really happy.


# "7th Heaven" (1996) {It Takes Two, Baby (#3.1)}
Matt Camden: [to Eric] Hang in there, it's only what? Six months?
Rev. Eric Camden: Yes, son, and while I try to balance the demands of
  the church with those of my pregnant wife, you'll be right here
  sharing the misery and joy with your dear old dad.
Matt Camden: Not if I can help it. I'm going to check out housing
  today, just in case they had a cancellation. I saved my money this
  summer.
Rev. Eric Camden: I thought you were going to get a car with your
  money.
Matt Camden: Well, the way I see it, a car gets me away form the
  house during the day, where as a room on campus gets me away day
  and night. Yes, I'm still close by if I ever want to visit. Or eat.
  Or do laundry.
Rev. Eric Camden: Or borrow the car?
Matt Camden: Yeah.
Rev. Eric Camden: Well, we only have two cars in this family and
  Mary, God help us, is going to be driving in a matter of weeks.
Matt Camden: That still leaves one car.
Rev. Eric Camden: Yes, it leaves my car.
Matt Camden: You saw the pants, Dad. You're not going anywhere.

Annie Camden: How is that I'm the one who has to watch every single
  morsel of food that I put into my mouth, and yet those crumbs turn
  into pounds and more pounds and more pounds, despite the fact that
  I've already puked most of what I've eaten the day before by the
  time I get out of bed the next morning?
Ruthie Camden: Yeah, we're fat and we're sick.
Annie Camden: And tired you know I'm really, really tired. It's not
  like having a baby at twenty or thirty, I'm...
Ruthie Camden: Old.
Annie Camden: And I've got six months to go. Six more months. Six
  months of tryinig to wear clothes that make me look...
Rev. Eric Camden: Like you're having a baby. Our baby.
Ruthie Camden: Yeah, our big fat baby.
Annie Camden: Yeah, she's right. You know that I was seven months
  pregnant with Matt before I was in maternity clothes. And now, at
  three months look at me, I'm fat. I'm old. I'm tired. And I'm fat.
Ruthie Camden: Yeah, I can't get in nothing of mine, neither.
Rev. Eric Camden: You can't get into anything, Ruthie, you don't fit
  into your clothes because you're getting bigger and that's because
  you're getting older.
Ruthie Camden: Yeah, just like Mommy.

Simon Camden: [to Ruthie] Just in case what isn't better?
Ruthie Camden: My morning sickness.
Simon Camden: Oh, give it up already.
Ruthie Camden: MOMMY!
Rev. Eric Camden: Simon, be nicer to your sister. This isn't easy on
  her and she's just a little girl.
Simon Camden: You say it like it's a weakness or something.

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Annie] It's going to be okay.
Annie Camden: It's not gonna be okay! It's only gonna get worse. I'm
  only gonna get fatter, and older, and tireder, and fatter! Then,
  when I'm at my oldest and tiredest and fattest, then I have to give
  birth to my fattest baby ever, probably with the world record head!
Ruthie Camden: Yeah. If you ask me, the only thing you daddies have
  to do to make a baby is the fun part.

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Ruthie] You know, maybe your tummy will be
  feeling better by lunchtime. Mommy's always is.
Ruthie Camden: Give me an extra paper bag, just in case it isn't.
Simon Camden: Just in case what isn't?
Ruthie Camden: My morning sickness.
Simon Camden: Oh, give it up! You're not sick, you're not tired, and
  you're not fat. You're just trying to get attention.
Ruthie Camden: MOMMY! [runs upstairs]
Simon Camden: [to Eric] Yeah. Whenever they're hurt, they run to
  Mommy, even when Dad is standing right there.


# "7th Heaven" (1996) {It Takes a Village (#2.16)}
Annie Camden: Ah, ah, you can run, but you can't hide.
Lucy Camden: I'll take hiding for now. But you know Mom, technically
  aside from making out, I really didn't do anything wrong.
Annie Camden: Oh, well this may sound harsh to you... to start with,
  you're on house probation for 3 months. Now if you an stay out of
  trouble for that long, I might consider letting you out the house
  before you turn 21. But if you so much as cross the line once...
  I'm going to have you low jacked, got it? Good!

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {Johnny Get Your Gun (#3.7)}
Simon Camden: Excuse me.
Johnny Morton: Oh, hey, little buddy. Am I in your way?
Simon Camden: It's not buddy. It's Simon Camden. You're Johnny, I
  presume?
Johnny Morton: So you've heard of me. That's good. Have you also
  heard that this is my girlfriend Deena?
Simon Camden: I believe that's was your girlfriend. Deena was your
  girlfriend. She's my girlfriend now.
Johnny Morton: Yeah, we'll see about that, buddy.

Mr. Morton: I have a license for that gun!
Reverend Eric Camden: I don't care if you have a license for that
  gun. License or no license, you seem to be in complete denial that
  something could go terribly wrong here.
Mr. Morton: I know my son, okay? I know he would never shoot anyone!
Sgt. Michaels: Just the same, until this situation is resolved, you
  might want to take the gun out of your house.
Reverend Eric Camden: That gun is for our protection
Sgt. Michaels: Did you know that people who own guns are 33 times
  more likely to kill themselves, a family member or an acquaintance
  than to be killed by an armed intruder?

Sgt. Michaels: [to Eric] I talked to the folks in juvenile. Johnny
  has a record. And just as you thought the family has a gun, a
  registered .38 special.

Mr. Morton: I was wrong. And I just wanted to apologize for what
  happened, and not listening to you when you told me my son was in
  trouble. If I had, this wouldn't have happened. I just thank God he
  didn't kill anybody.
Reverend Eric Camden: Amen.

Reverend Eric Camden: I-I just have to ask you, has Johnny ever been
  in trouble?
Mr. Morton: I think this conversations gone far enough.
Reverend Eric Camden: Do you own a gun? [Mr. Morton sighs] Oh, I
  thought so.
Mr. Morton: Did you know that guns don't kill people, people kill
  people!
Reverend Eric Camden: People with guns kill people! No, is it too
  much ask that this man to admit that his son has problem, and take
  some action!

Johnny Morton: Listen, Mighty Mouse, stay out of this, or I'm going
  to take you out of it!
Simon Camden: Take me out of it?
Johnny Morton: [makes a gun with his fingers] Get it?
Simon Camden: You're gonna shoot me?
Simon Camden: Yeah, maybe. All of a sudden you'll turn around and see
  a .38 Special pointed right at you. [chuckles] Yeah, I just might
  do that. You'll have to look over your shoulder everywhere you go.

Vice Principal Blackstone: I have to follow procedure. I have to call
  in the parents, have a meeting with them, send the kid to a
  counselor. They have to recommend that he see a therapist or I have
  to risk losing my 10 year retirement, and that may not sound much,
  but I have a family too.
Reverend Eric Camden: Okay, well what about tomorrow? What happens if
  he comes to school with a gun tomorrow?
Vice Principal Blackstone: I agree that Simon and Deena should stay
  home from school until I get some answers.
Reverend Eric Camden: Well, thanks for your help.

Simon Camden: This is all my fault. I shouldn't have said anything.
Lucy Camden Kinkirk: It's not your fault. It's not your fault at all.
  If you hadn't said anything, something worse could have happened.
  He could have shown up at school with that gun! Johnny's a kid with
  a bad temper. A bad temper and a gun. That's a really bad
  combination.

Lucy Camden Kinkirk: [after Eric is shot] I just wish somebody would
  have told me what was going on.
Simon Camden: Mom and Dad were hoping they wouldn't have to scare the
  rest of the family. Besides, what would you have done anyway?
Ruthie Camden: Well, for one thing, I wouldn't have been running
  around yelling "Ba-Boom!"

Annie Jackson-Camden: [in response to Ruthie playing a game where
  people step on land mines] Ruthie, did you know that there are real
  people who step on real land mines? They lose arms and legs... and
  some even die.
Ruthie Camden: Yeah, but this isn't real life. It's just a game. A
  video game.

Reverend Eric Camden: [to Ruthie] Let me try to explain to you why
  your mom and I are so upset by this whole "Ba-Boom!" thing.
Ruthie Camden: After that, then can I get the video game?
Reverend Eric Camden: Listen... when you first see someone shot or
  blown up on TV, it has to be at least a little scary. But then if
  you keep watching it day after day, week after week, year after
  year, it starts to grow less scary, less a big deal, and even gets
  to seem like... nothing. But it is something. It's the biggest
  something. It's someone taking someone else's life.

Mary Camden: [to George] I'm not kidding, you're hurting me, let go!
George: Only if you say please.
Mary Camden: [elbows him and knocks him to the ground] I don't have
  to say please! I don't know what kind of girls you're used to going
  out with, but I don't find physical violence appropriate for a
  date!
George: And yet, you're hurting my hand.
Mary Camden: [lets go George's hand] You have a problem. Deal with
  it.

Reverend Eric Camden: [to Simon] Are you in some kind of trouble?
Simon Camden: I'm not sure about that either. See, the thing is, is
  that he's probably trying to scare me. But Deena's boyfriend said
  that he was going to shoot me.

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {Losers (#5.3)}
Mary Camden: [to Eric as he feeds the twins] Where's Mom?
Rev. Eric Camden: I am perfectly capable of feeding my own sons. I do
  it all the time! I have fed my children for over 21 years now.
  True, for many of them, your mom cooked most of those meals while I
  was out earning the money to pay for those meals, but from time to
  time, I have fed one of my offspring, or all of my offspring, just
  as I am doing now, without the aid of Mom!
Mary Camden: I'm just looking for Mom because she asked me to pick up
  some soap for her.
Rev. Eric Camden: Oh. She's upstairs.

Annie Camden: [to Ruthie after she saw Annie and Eric having sex]
  Ruthie, it really isn't funny.
Ruthie Camden: Oh, it's plenty funny! I always thought it was so
  serious, because you always have this serious face when you talk
  about sex, but trust me, it was funny!
Annie Camden: It's also very... private, and very intimate, and even
  though it's perfectly natural for a man and a woman - a married man
  and a married: woman - to... make love, it's not something that's
  meant for anyone else to watch.
Ruthie Camden: I didn't mean to, and believe me, I'm going to do
  everything I can to make sure I never see anything like that again!

Mary Camden: Dad, please. They really are my friends, Frankie is my
  friend! She asked me to bring over those college brochures tonight
  so we could look over them, and make a plan to go back to school.
Rev. Eric Camden: And did you?
Mary Camden: No.
Rev. Eric Camden: Because she was too stoned? Mary... who are you and
  what are you doing with these people?

Mary Camden: [to Eric] If you're not going to help them, I'll help
  them.
Rev. Eric Camden: How? You don't have a job, you don't have any
  money. You have to help yourself before you can help anyone else!

Frankie: It just seems so unfair. You make one little mistake, you
  know?
Mary Camden: Yeah, I know. I made a big mistake once, too. I got
  arrested last year for trashing the school gym.
Frankie: [laughs] Arrested? You?
Mary Camden: Yeah. I'm still on probation.
Frankie: Oh, so that's why you don't drink or smoke or anything.
Mary Camden: Yeah, kind of... but also because I feel so out of
  control, anyway - like I couldn't get my life back on track even if
  I wanted to. Not that I want to - I mean, it's not so bad, but it's
  just...
Frankie: Existing. Just existing. I know what you mean. Every time I
  make an effort to do something, it just feels like there's so much
  resistance... and I give up before I even start trying.
Mary Camden: Maybe we could help each other. Maybe we could make an
  effort together. Maybe we could go to college and see if anything
  changes. I brought the brochures, do you want to look at them?
Frankie: No, not right now, I'm too out of it. Maybe some other time.
Mary Camden: [disappointed] Yeah. Maybe some other time. [stands up]
Frankie: No, don't say it like that. Don't give up on me. I need a
  friend.
Mary Camden: Well, I need a friend too.

Frankie: [on the phone with Mary] Hey, what if you and I both decided
  to sign up for college together next semester?
Johnny: [smirking in the background] Be sure to apply for that
  scholarship!
Mary Camden: Are you serious?
Frankie: Sure, I'm serious. I don't know what I want to do, either,
  but I know I don't want to wait tables for the rest of my life.

Lucy Camden: [to Ruthie] I want to read what's in that diary.
Ruthie Camden: And I want to win a million bucks. Not gonna happen.

Ruthie Camden: I have no life. On the other hand, everyone else in
  this house does!

Frankie: [to Johnny] Why do you always have to act like this when
  somebody comes over?
Johnny: I don't act like this whenever someone comes over, I act like
  this all the time.
Frankie: Right. You do act like this all the time. So when are you
  going to grow up?
Johnny: Get off my case, will you?
Frankie: You could at least help me out a little around here. It's
  not like I ask you to do that much.
Johnny: You don't ask me to do that much? You asked me to marry you,
  didn't you?

Matt Camden: [to Annie] So Ruthie caught you and Dad... um, you know?
Annie Camden: Yes. Okay? Yes!
Matt Camden: I should have seen that one coming.
Annie Camden: No, you shouldn't have, it's never happened before!
Matt Camden: Yes, it has. Um... we've all seen you. I've seen you,
  Mary's seen you, Lucy's seen you, even Simon has seen you. Did you
  do that thing where you said you were gonna check on one of the
  kids and then Dad said he's gonna go check on you? That usually
  signals the red flag and we all steer clear, but Ruthie just didn't
  know the signal!
Annie Camden: Well, how did the rest of you know the signal?
Matt Camden: It's kind of an obvious signal.
Annie Camden: No it isn't!
Matt Camden: Yes it is.
Annie Camden: Go to bed.
Matt Camden: I don't live here.
Annie Camden: Go to bed, anyway.
Simon Camden: [teasingly] You know, you're never too old or too smart
  to do what your mother says.

Mary Camden: [to Frankie] Is that... Is that pot?
Frankie: Yeah. I just need it to loosen up. This whole mother and
  wife gig really sucks.

Frankie: [about Johnny] He's not such a bad guy, you know. He wanted
  to go to college, too, major in English Lit, and be a writer.
Mary Camden: Hey, we all still have plenty of time to be whatever it
  is we want to be, right?
Frankie: Right. [baby starts crying from her crib] Whatever I'm going
  to be doesn't change who I already am: a mom.

Mary Camden: [about Frankie and Johnny] They are good people. They're
  both working, and they're trying to raise this kid, and it's really
  hard.
Rev. Eric Camden: So hard that they have to smoke pot.

Rev. Eric Camden: That could be a problem with this guy since he's
  too old to be my son.

Rev. Eric Camden: [Yelling at Mary] I hope that every time you even
  think of kissing him you think about kissing your father!


# "7th Heaven" (1996) {Moving Ahead (#10.16)}
Annie Camden: Normal is way overrated.

Kevin Kinkirk: You always had to have steak when you were pregnant
  with Savannah. We're having a baby.
Rev. Lucy Kinkirk: Listen to me... If every woman who wanted a steak
  was pregnant, they'd sell maternity wear at Sizzler's.

Annie Camden: Taste this ice cream. I mean, think of all the
  beautiful cows who were grazing in the meadow and then just walked
  into the barn to get milked.
Ruthie Camden: And think of the beef cows who wind up in the
  slaughterhouse being put down by a stun gun.

Rev. Lucy Kinkirk: Can you belive this wait? It's like they should
  give out numbers, you know, like a bakery. Well, I guess it's like
  a bakery, you know, in the "bun in the oven" sense. That's what my
  grandma would say: "A bun in the oven". I wish I had a bun, I'm
  starving.

[Knitting]
Jenny Jackson: This started out to be a sweater for your grandpa, but
  too much work you know, so I think it maybe'll be an afghan for a
  gerbil.

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {No Sex, Some Drugs and a Little Rock 'n' Roll (#3.8)}
Ruthie Camden: [as Annie catches Simon drinking coffee] I'm not
  drinking coffee, I just stole it for him.
Simon Camden: [to Ruthie] Thanks a lot.
Annie Camden: Simon! [grabs the phone from Lucy] Goodbye Jordan.
Lucy Camden: I had to call him to tell him I couldn't call him.
Annie Camden: [to Ruthie about her gum] Come on, spit it out. [to
  Simon] You, no coffee. [to Ruthie] You, no gum. [to Lucy] And you,
  no phone. Got it? Good.

Annie Camden: [to Ruthie] Spit it out.
Ruthie Camden: How did you know?
Annie Camden: I have eyes in the back of my head.
Ruthie Camden: If that were really true, I'd bring you in to Show 'N'
  Tell.

Annie Camden: Lucy, wait. I got the phone bill today.
Lucy Camden: Congratulations.
Annie Camden: Your phone usage is completely out of control.
Lucy Camden: Define "out of control."

Lucy Camden: [to Annie] How did you learn to be so cruel?
Annie Camden: It's in the "Mommy Manual" between crafts and cuddling.

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Matt] What are you doing with this stuff?
Matt Camden: A friend at school gave gave 'em to me. Their just
  natural energy boosters made from herbs or something.
Rev. Eric Camden: Not everything that is natural is good for you.
  Cocaine is extracted from the cope of plant. Heroin and Morphine
  come from natural plants and extracts. Natural doesn't always mean
  good!
Matt Camden: Dad, calm down, okay. Check the bottle, it's sealed I
  didn't take any. I was just looking for a way to keep awake so I
  could keep studying.
Rev. Eric Camden: Oh, you'll stay awake because the main ingredient
  in these pills is Ephedrine which is just a chemical process away
  from from being Methaphetamine.
Matt Camden: Wait, I don't get it, I mean the guy who gave these
  pills bought them from a health-food store. I mean if this stuff is
  so dangerous, then why is it not illegal?
Rev. Eric Camden: Because Ephedrine is classified as a food, not a
  drug, so it's not regulated the way it should be. Ephedrine-based
  supplements are illegal in 13 states. You know that it took to make
  them illegal? People died. [Mary enters the room] What's wrong?
Mary Camden: I took those pills.
Rev. Eric Camden: You took these pills?
Mary Camden: No, I didn't get the pills from Matt, I got them from
  Diane who gets them from her father. I thought everyone was taking
  them.
Rev. Eric Camden: I think I better talk to Diane's father. Throw them
  out.
Matt Camden: Gladly.

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {Secrets (#10.19)}
Sam: What is that?
Rose: It's a mini fridge. It's for our office which is gonna be on
  the second floor of the condo we're renting. The kitchen's on the
  first floor, so we thought it would be nice if we didn't have to go
  downstairs everytime we wanted a cold drink.
David: That's what we have to do.
Sam: Yeah, it's a pain.
Kevin: You're seven.
David: It's still a pain.

Ruthie Camden: It's old news, really. Very old news. I mean, it
  probably doesn't even matter anymore. Remember when Matt took Sarah
  on their first date, and they stayed out all night, and came home
  with that lame cover story about how they stayed up all night
  talking and decided to get married?
Annie Camden: Yeah.
Ruthie Camden: They were already married. They got married on their
  first date.
Rev. Lucy Kinkirk: And they told you?

Ruthie Camden: [to Annie] I can keep a secret. I've kept Matt's
  secret for years. [realizes what she said and runs out of the room]

Rose: I remember the first time about a girl getting kissed by a boy.
  He had a peppermint in his mouth and the kiss was sticky. It made
  me not wanna kiss a boy for years.
Annie Camden: I bet your mom gave you the book "A Kiss in the
  Library." I gave that book to Mary, Lucy, and Ruthie, but
  unfortunately, it had the opposite effect.


# "7th Heaven" (1996) {See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil (#1.9)}
Jimmy Moon: I thought you could find something you don't like about
  me and use it as a reason to keep Lucy from seeing me.
Rev. Eric Camden: Oh, so she could be mad at me instead of being mad
  at you?
Jimmy Moon: An unintentional but admittedly fortunate biproduct.

Lucy: The Colonel would throw himself in front of a moving car for

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {Sin... (#4.7)}
Coach Jason Cleary: I understand that some of this has to do with
  "senioritus". I don't care. You were told in no uncertain terms
  that your studies were the priority and your grades had to show
  immediate improvement. Unfortunately, these reports show that they
  haven't. Now, I don't know if you didn't have an understanding of
  just how serious I was, or if you didn't have time to study. But
  now, you have both. [locks the gym doors]
Elaine: Practice is cancelled?
Coach Jason Cleary: You are students here who play basketball. You're
  not basketball players who show up to classes whenever the mood
  strikes. Until you proven that you understand that by bringing your
  grades up, this season and this team are cancelled!
Mary Camden: You can't do that!

Mary Camden: This can't happen. This is my senior year and I have a
  scholarship to play basketball. I mean, somebody has to do
  something.
Simon Camden: Why did he lock you guys out?
Matt Camden: Mom had two babies, Dad just had a heart attack, and now
  this? They have enough going on without having to worry about
  without the stuff. You're supposed to be the oldest. How can Mom
  and Dad trust that you can keep an eye on everyone else when you
  can't keep an eye on yourself?
Mary Camden: Oh, boy. One more lecture on how it is to be the oldest.
  How many times do I have to hear this stuff from you?
Matt Camden: Until you get it right.
Mary Camden: Go away! And take your lemony-scented self with you.

Simon Camden: It's not like I hurt anyone.
Annie Camden: I don't care. It's an incredible rude and vulgar
  gesture that should never be shown in public or anywhere else for
  that matter. You're lucky you still have those fingers!
Simon Camden: My friends and I do that kind of things to each other
  all the time, and no one cares. It's... It's a guy thing.
Annie Camden: It is not a guy thing.
Simon Camden: How would you know?
Rev. Eric Camden: You know, I'll admit that there was an unfortunate
  element of bad timing at work. On the other hand you know, your mom
  and I aren't fans of that particular gesture. I's disrespectful.
  It's rude and obscene.
Simon Camden: But I was just hanging out. Being one of the guys.
Rev. Eric Camden: I get it. I really do. There's something great
  about hanging out with just the guys you know, as long as being one
  of the guys doesn't mean being swayed by the guys. 'Cause for some
  reason a lot of guys do really stupid things when they're with the
  other guys, you know? Things that they wouldn't even think of doing
  if they were alone. And I just don't want you to lose your great
  ability to think and make decisions for yourself.

Rev. Eric Camden: Did you guys know what would happen if you didn't
  get your grades up?
Mary Camden: [reluctantly] Yeah.
Rev. Eric Camden: Well, then, for now, I support this lockout.
Mary Camden: What?
Annie Camden: I'm sorry, kiddo, but your coach didn't screw up. You
  did.

Annie Camden: We love our kids. We work really hard at trying to be
  good parents who see the right examples, but there comes a point in
  life where you have to throw them out into the world and pray.
Rev. Eric Camden: What about Mary?
Annie Camden: Maybe we pushed her too far. Mary's a good kid.

  couples.
Vincent: Okay, so... what if Ruthie doesn't get married in her
  twenties or her thirties and she's in her mid forties, on her own,
  earning her own money, living in her own house, and she's madly in
  love with this great guy who has a fear of commitment?

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {The Kid Is Out of the Picture (#8.5)}
Simon: She's going to be the hardest to leave and the hardest to hang
  on to because she's Ruthie and she's 13 and she's got a boyfriend.
  And while she understands that I want to leave the rest of the
  family, she doesn't understand how I can leave her but I don't
  think she'll hold it against me, she won't have the time to hold it
  against me. She's emerging from childhood to adulthood full speed
  ahead with thoughtful intelligence, a great sense of humor, and a
  high self esteem. I'd like to think I had something to do with how
  great she's turned out so far and I hope to remain a positive
  influence in her life, but here's the thing - I know she feels my
  pain, we're that close. And as hard as it is, I really do think
  it's best to put a little distance between us right now because I
  would never forgive myself if I put any rain on Ruthie's parade,
  and truthfully I know she will be just fine without me.

Matt Camden: But this is our house, our family, Robbie has a family
  of his own.
Simon Camden: I know, Lucy made out with half of them.

Simon Camden: [to the guys huffing in the hall] Hey, you guys are
  going to get a huge headache if you do that.
Pete Lawrence: It's called huffing. It makes you you feel like you're
  walking on clouds, right? Wanna try it... or are you too PURE?
  Didn't think so.
Mitch: Hey, Camden, you say a word to anyone, and your life will be
  hell.

Shana Sullivan: [to Matt] I've been accepted to NYU for pre-med and
  classes start in January.
Matt Camden: NYU as in New York?... I don't know what hurts more,
  that you're going away, or that you told my dad before you told me.
Shana Sullivan: Come on. Can't we talk about this?
Matt Camden: I think it's too late for that.

Pete Lawrence: Spray paint makes it faster and it's a lot of fun.
Simon Camden: How do you breathe around that stuff?
Pete Lawrence: Oh, you'll get used to it, actually, you'll probably
  start to like it after a while.
Simon Camden: Where are the guys?
Pete Lawrence: Oh, uh... they decided to catch a breather.
Simon Camden: We could use a breather, too. [Pete laughs] What?
Pete Lawrence: You're too PURE to understand.

Lucy Camden Kinkirk: [to Mary] You met a guy at your community
  service program, didn't you?
Mary Camden: Yes, I knew you wanted to know.
Lucy Camden Kinkirk: No. I don't wanna know. I don't wanna know
  anything.
Mary Camden: He's gorgeous and his name is Robbie.
Lucy Camden Kinkirk: Great. Now I know his name.

Reverend Eric Camden: [to Mary] Hey, do you wanna tell me anything?
Mary Camden: Not really.
Reverend Eric Camden: Sometimes when someone leaves out information
  that absence could be considered a lie by omission.
Mary Camden: Am I that someone?
Reverend Eric Camden: I thought we agreed that you couldn't see
  anyone while you were on restriction.
Mary Camden: I'm not seeing anyone. But in the interest of not lying
  by omission there's a guy who's also doing community service that I
  talk to. But he is just a guy. And doing community service together
  can hardly be considered seeing anyone. And, besides, why does
  punishment always have to be a bad thing?
Reverend Eric Camden: Well... because it's punishment... does this
  guy have a name?
Mary Camden: Yes, he has a wonderful name. Robbie Palmer. Now I have
  to go or I'll be late.

Mrs. Jasper: Pete Lawrence collapsed on his way into school. His nose
  was bleeding and he was having trouble breathing.
Simon Camden: I didn't know it was serious or at least this serious.
  I thought it can only make your nose bleed.
Reverend Eric Camden: A bloody nose is the least of it. Huffing
  causes liver damage and kidney failure. Heart failure.
Simon Camden: Can you die from it?
Reverend Eric Camden: Kids do every year.

Mrs. Lawrence: The spray paint Pete used came from your garage. Pete
  said Simon brought it to school. [Simon shakes his head, "no."] You
  just stay away from my son. You've done enough damage.

Simon Camden: I've never heard of huffing before. Why would anyone
  find that fun?
Annie Jackson-Camden: I don't know.

Mary Camden: Robbie got transferred.
Reverend Eric Camden: We know.
Mary Camden: Why'd you do it?
Reverend Eric Camden: We think your community service shouldn't be
  anything but community service.
Annie Jackson-Camden: It's not something you're doing for yourself,
  it's something you're doing for the community as a payback... when
  the first phase of your service is complete and if you get a
  satisfactory review, then we'll see about Robbie coming over so we
  can get to know him better and you can get to know him better.
Mary Camden: Then I guess I'm really grateful.

Reverend Eric Camden: [to Simon] I talked to Mrs. Jasper. Pete told
  his mom about the other guys and the huffing. Principals' is
  meeting with the boys and their parents tomorrow... Pete promised
  to call each of the guys and explain why he ratted them out. No one
  is going to think it was you.
Simon Camden: I don't care if they do.
Reverend Eric Camden: Good for you.

Simon Camden: How's Pete?
Reverend Eric Camden: The doctor said there wasn't any permanent
  damage, but when he's better he'll have to go though a detox
  program to get the chemicals out of his system. And I recommended
  that he and his parents meet with a family counselor.

Mary Camden: I'm not seeing anyone, but in the interest of not lying
  by omission, there's a guy who's also doing community service that
  I talk to, but he's just a guy. And doing community service
  together can hardly be considered seeing someone.
Reverend Eric Camden: Yeah.
Mary Camden: And besides, why does punishment always have to be a bad
  thing?
Reverend Eric Camden: Um... because it's punishment.

Pete Lawrence: [to Simon when he visits him in the hospital] Just go
  away.
Simon Camden: I can't.
Pete Lawrence: Why?
Simon Camden: Because your mom thinks I did this to you.
Pete Lawrence: Yeah. I let her think that.
Simon Camden: I know. And it's okay. You must have been scared, and
  you had to tell your mom something. When you're feeling better, you
  can tell her the truth.
Pete Lawrence: If I do, I'll get all my friends in trouble.
Simon Camden: And that's better than getting one innocent guy in
  trouble. Look, under normal circumstances, I wouldn't mind taking
  the wrap for a friend, but you and your buddies have to stop
  huffing, or eventually, they're gonna end up just like you, or
  maybe even worse.

Shana Sullivan: Are we breaking up?
Matt Camden: I don't want to break up with you.

# "7th Heaven" (1996) {With Honors (#4.5)}
Mary Camden: [to Corey] How did you hide this from everyone?
Corey Conway: It wasn't easy. I couldn't have anyone over to my
  house. I couldn't go to parties or stay out late. Forget about
  dating. With taking care of a baby I barely had time to go to
  school or play basketball. When I think about it, I actually don't
  even know how I was able to finish high school. Most teen mothers
  don't. I do know that I couldn't have done it without my mom. She's
  been there for me every step of the way since... the day I told her
  I was pregnant.
Mary Camden: Man, motherhood at fourteen.
Corey Conway: You know what's harder than motherhood? Your friends
  talking and whispering behind you back.
Mary Camden: Not everyone is talking about you.
Corey Conway: Please, this spring I'm graduating Magna Cum Laude. I'm
  the top score on a championship basketball team and I've been
  accepted to 3 Ivy League Colleges. But now, thanks to Maggie, the
  only thing that everyone cares about is that at 14 I had a baby.

Elaine: [to Mary] Did you hear the rumor? It's all over school.
Mary Camden: I just saw you this morning. How could anything be all
  over school?
Elaine: Well, what can I say the real juicy stuff has a life of its
  own. Corey Conway had a baby when she was fourteen.
Mary Camden: Corey had a baby?
Elaine: Yeah, Maggie the new girl, said that there was a Corey Conway
  who went to her junior high school, and that Corey got pregnant and
  dropped out of school and had a baby.

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Lucy] Hey, how was the attendance office?
Lucy Camden: It was fabulous, fun, fantastic.
Annie Camden: Teenagers.
Rev. Eric Camden: Yeah, if you don't like their mood, wait 10
  minutes.

Corey Conway: I had a baby when I was 14. Are you satisfied now?

Mary Camden: I'd really like to thank the local businessman's
  association for this honor, but I can't. Excellence in sports and
  in life to individuals we have future generations see as role
  models. I've never thought of myself as a role model. I go to
  school and get good grades. I go to basketball games and score
  points. But a role model, I don't think so. But there was a real
  role model who was supposed to receive this award with me today.
  But at the last minute the committee changed their minds. You all
  know who I'm talking about, because for the last 24 hours most of
  you have done nothing but talk about her. She's my friend, my
  teammate. She's Corey Conway. And when she was 14, she had a baby.
  Corey Conway is a person, not an issue. And the only statement made
  by celebrating her achievements is to honor that someone who didn't
  take the easy road in life and did what few others could have done.
  Finish high school... With honors... While raising a baby. I want
  to let you know how I feel before I bring Corey out on stage and
  give her my award. Because even if she's not a role model for the
  local businessman's association or for some of the students ate
  this school, she is for me.

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Jeff] Look, I'm the minister at the Glenoak
  Community Church. And if there's a problem, I can help, I can...
Jeff Patterson: No, thank you, but I think you should mind your own
  business.
Rev. Eric Camden: When your son brought drugs into my house it became
  my business.

Ruthie Camden: So, what kind of fun stuff do we have planned for
  tomorrow?
Annie Camden: [to Eric] Teacher Work Day. No school for Ruthie.
Ruthie Camden: Yes!
Annie Camden: Okay, let's see. Tomorrow, you can help me clean the
  bathrooms, do the laundry, repair the kitchen sink, iron the socks,
  reorganize the linen closet, and go shopping.
Ruthie Camden: Toy shopping?
Annie Camden: Food shopping.
Ruthie Camden: Man, this is gonna be worse than school!

Lucy Camden: [to her parents] You have to help me. I don't want to
  work in the attendance office tomorrow!
Annie Camden: Well, maybe you shouldn't have volunteered.
Lucy Camden: But at the time I volunteered, I didn't realize I'd have
  to give up my study hall. I thought it was before school or
  something. I need my study hall!
Rev. Eric Camden: To study?
Lucy Camden: Yeah, sure. Plus, it's the only time I have before lunch
  to catch up with my friends and re-touch my makeup. [long pause,
  Eric and Annie are baffled] So you're not going to help me?

Mrs. Patterson: [to George] I should have kicked you out. I should
  have told you that if you did drugs, you couldn't live with me, but
  I thought turning my back on my son made me a bad mother. But I was
  wrong. It made me a bad grandmother. Look, if you won't straighten
  up for me, do it for Lee. He's your son! You need to act like his
  father, and if you don't make me a promise, right that you will
  take the steps to clean up your life, then I will take custody of
  Lee, and you'll never see us again. And I don't want to do that. I
  just can't sit by and watch my grandson turn to drugs, the way my
  son did.
Rev. Eric Camden: Admitting you have a problem is the first step. I
  think it's the hardest step, too.
Mrs. Patterson: I'll be there for you every step of the way, and as
  long as you're clean and sober, you can live with me. But you've
  got to get a job. You've got to start contributing to the
  household.
Jeff Patterson: I just... I don't know if I can do it.
Lee Patterson: Dad, please. I already lost a mom. I don't want to
  lose you, too. I love you.

Ruthie Camden: Mom, can I have $29.99? I just have to have these
  walkie talkies I saw on TV! Then I can call all my friends, and
  they can call me back, and it only costs $29.99!
Annie Camden: But if you use the phone to call your friends and
  pretend the phone is a walkie-talkie, it'll cost less.
Ruthie Camden: [rolls eyes] Parents!

Rev. Eric Camden: [to Ruthie] So have you reconsidered my offer?
  'cause if you really those walky talkies getting an allowance is
  the only way to go.
Ruthie Camden: No, thank you. I don't need an allowance. I have a
  plan. And it's a lot easier than taking out the trash for the rest
  of my life.
Annie Camden: She has a plan, should we be concerned?
Rev. Eric Camden: Not concerned, afraid. Very afraid.

Kyle: Wassup my brotha from anotha motha?

Paul: For Michigan fans, football is a religion. And the Ohio State
  game is Easter.

Paul: Fine, you can take the mini-van.
Bridget: You want me to drive the Loser Cruiser?

Cate: Are you okay?
Paul: I'm mad at something you said.
Cate: What?
Paul: 'Let's start a family'!

Bridget: I need more boyfriends.

Paul: Hold it, I can see your bra and that sling-shot you're wearing.
Kerry: Must be Casual Sex Day at school.
Bridget: It's a thong.
Paul: It's floss.

[Bridget walks downstairs dressed in tight pants and a short shirt]
Paul: Uh, Bridget, why are you dressed like that?
Kerry: Must be casual sex day at school.
Bridget: Hey, at least I get...
[Paul turns to Bridget]
Bridget: ...Look good.
Paul: Okay, Cupcake, I think you missed the word "under" in underwear
  because I can see your bra and that slingshot your wearing under
  your pants.
Bridget: It's a thong.
Paul: It's floss.
Bridget: I can't wear anything else. Panty lines - Hello?
Paul: Panty lines - Hello, are fine. Actually they were a pretty big
  deal in my day.
Bridget: Well, we're the thong generation.
Paul: Well, maybe that's why your generation is so angry. Your always
  walking around with a wedgie!

Rory: Uh, Dad...
Paul: Not now Rory!
Rory: But it's important!
Paul: I said just a minute!
Rory: [opens front door] Well ok...
Paul: Is that Bridget? Is that Bridget driving my car? Without a
  license?
Rory: Oh, so now you wanna know.

Kerry Hennessy: Two! Four! Six! Eight! These mashed potatoes are
  really great!

Kerry Hennessy: I can't believe you're encouraging your daughter to
  join the Airhead Squad. Aim High!

Bridget: Daddy, can our boyfriends come over on Thanksgiving?
Paul: No!
Bridget: Okay, Daddy, can they come over Thursday?

Paul: Honey, you can do anything as long as you never root for Ohio
  State.

Bridget: I don't need to go to college because I already know what I
  want to be. An estitician!

Cate: You want to be a beautician?
Paul: A facialist?
Rory: A zit-popper?

Kerry: Your oldest daughter has been in the bathroom for, like, an
  hour.
Paul: An hour? What is she doing in there?
Kerry: Well we can rule out reading.

Paul: Would somebody like to listen to my announcement?
Kerry: Switched at birth. Please say I was switched at birth.

Paul: One more smart remark like that, young lady, and there will be
  serious consequences.
Kerry: My life is a consequence.

Rory: I think I need some alone time.

Cate: Ok, girls. Broccoli or zucchini?
Bridget: What? For dinner?
Kerry: [sarcastically] No... She's making a hat!

Kerry: Don't mess with the middle child!

Bridget: Maybe the bears wanna dance!

Kerry: Oh come on Dad. Do you really think that in six months I will
  be more prepared to date?
Paul: No, but I will.

[Paul has a dream and is in the "Three's Company" house]
Paul: This looks strangely familiar.

Kyle: I'm gonna go to the other side of the mall, touch it, and come
  back.

Kyle: Hey Bridget, you should wear a bikini to the party and go as
  "hot."

Paul: Rory! Go sit in the car!
Rory: But, dad! We're at home!
Paul: GO SIT IN THE CAR!

[a little girl dressed as an angel comes to the door on Haloween
  accompanied by her father]
Angel: Trick or Treat! I'm an angel!
Paul: Yeah, you may be an angel now, but in a few years you're going
  to be killing your father!
Angel: Daddy!

[after tricking C.J. into driving to Canada for no reason]
Jim: The pain in my hip is still here, but the pain in my ass is in
  Canada!

Paul: Rory, you're baking cookies?
Rory: Big cookies. Man cookies. Cookies with nuts!

Kerry: I just think it's funny that your'e worried about me when
  Bridget says stuff like "I'm going to the library."

Bridget: Daddy, are you sure you don't need any help, Kyle's great at
  undoing knots.
Rory: And hooks and buttons and snaps.

Cate: Whatever happened to my good child?
C.J.: The thief, the druggie, or the biker chick?

Jim: That wasn't a thirty-minute shower - I fell!

Cate: Okay rusty, where's blondie?

Paul: Kyle, just so you know, if you ever pull into my driveway and
  honk, you better be delivering a package because you're sure as
  hell not picking anything up.

[after Kyle gets off the phone with a girl named Lindsay]
Kyle: Uh, Mr. Hennessy -...
Paul: Please, Sensei. Lindsay, huh? You have other girlfriends, Kyle,
  and that's fine with me.
Kyle: Sweet!
Paul: As long as it's okay with my daughter. Otherwise, you will
  continue to date her and no one but her, until she is finished with
  you. Because if you make her cry, I will make you cry.

Kerry: Hey! There's a sale on Blue and Gold body paint, you could
  smear it all over your body and watch the game in the nude!

Kerry: Like Oh My God, my name's Bridget and I can't believe how much
  my head shakes when I talk!

Kerry: [mimicking Bridget] Oh my God Daddy my shoe lace broke what do
  I do?

Kerry: [to Bridget] You know your gonna hate prison, everyone's gonna
  be dressed like you!

Bridget: Oh please, the only reason you're popular is because I went
  out with Kyle, which made him popular. And then I dumped him and
  you got him on the rebound which made you popular, then I had a
  deep relationship with Donny Doyle. Probably the most meaningful
  two weeks of my life of my entire life. Totally taking me out the
  loop creating a popularity vacuum and voila¯!
Kerry: What's that supposed to mean?
Bridget: I dunno; it's French, but magicians do it too.

Kerry: Mom, Fred Doyle is planning on having dinner with Dad and
  Jesus in Heaven?
Cate: Come on it's a nice thought.
Kerry: Yeah but Dad's spent three years avoiding the Doyle's annual
  barbecue, how's he gonna get outta that? I mean Dad's a terrible
  liar, and Jesus is gonna be sitting right there.
Cate: Yeah and Fred going on about the difference between electric
  and gas powered weed whackers. And Jesus isn't going to wanna back
  outta that dare!

Cate: [reading Paul's last article] Okay readers, today we're having
  a little pop quiz, it's multiple choice, so sharpen your number 2
  pencils and put your thinking caps on. Ready? Here's a quote: "Dad,
  you're an idiot." Now, contestants, this was said to me because of
  which of the following transgressions? A: Coming to the breakfast
  table wearing pajamas and black socks? B: Asking my oldest daughter
  if that guy I saw her talking to yesterday at school was her
  boyfriend? C: Referring to rapper Fiddy Cent as "Fifty Cents"? or
  D: Entering the room? Okay, pencils down. Actually it was a trick
  question. The answer is all of the above. Now do you know how many
  times I called my father an idiot? Zero. Why? Because I feared him.
  Back then we didn't share our deep personal feelings, our deepest
  conversations usually revolved around the tigers bull pen. But my
  kids, I can't get them to shut up! There's not a feeling that my
  kids are afraid to express over and over and over. And my wife
  reassures me this is a good thing over and over and over, and she's
  always right. So do I wish that my kids feared me? Well my house
  would be quieter, and I'd spend a lot less time in the bathroom,
  but no. Because I know that whenever they insult me whether it's a
  "You're an idiot," "You're a geek," or an "I hate you," an "I love
  you" isn't far behind. And it's the knowledge that my wife and kids
  love me that makes it safe for me to wear pajamas and black socks
  to the breakfast table.

Paul: You know how I want your sisters to date only the good guys?
  Well, I want you to be good guy.
Rory: You want me to date my sisters?

Rory: [to Cate while she's sleeping] You want Rory to have a monkey,
  you yourself love monkeys. You want Rory to have a monkey, you
  yourself love monkeys.

Kerry: Look at me! You said you were gonna dye my hair! I look like
  Dolly Parton!

Kerry: I can't believe you just called me Bridget!
Bridget: Don't just sit there Kerry, thank him!

C.J.: Hey, I'm a man. I have man-like qualities.

Kerry Hennessy: How do I look?
Rory: Like Kenny from South Park.

Kerry: Move it C.J.!
C.J.: Whats the matter? Trouble in the cabbage patch?

Rory: Dad, do you think I'm pretty?

C.J.: Do you know what the C In C.J stands for? It's Cory. Hi, Rory,
  it's your cousin Cory, what you doing?
Rory: Watching you make a complete ass out of yourself.

Cate: I would just like to know what's going on inside my good child.
C.J.: The thief, the druggie, or the biker chick?

Bridget: Hey Grampa, what's up?
Jim: Blood pressure and bad cholesterol.

Kyle: [speaking to Bridget] Because of you, my girlfriend's gonna run
  off to Europe, and fall in love with some fancy French guy named
  José.
Kerry: José is Spanish.
Kyle: You've already met him?

[Kerry is trying to figure out how to break up with Kyle]
Bridget: Just use the line I use when I break up with a guy.
Kerry: "I'm only seventeen, you'll go to jail"?

Cate: [walks into Ed's office] I'm not in trouble, am I?
Ed Gibb: Not unless you're chewing gum.
Cate: [Spits a wad of gum into a tissue]

Cate: [to Ed Gibb] Maybe we should just get off my bed.

Bridget: Mom, do you have any pictures of Dad?
Cate: Well of course honey, whatever you want
Bridget: Okay well I need 25 from various stages of his life... For
  my wallet
Cate: What are you up to?
Bridget: Nothing! Why are you so suspicious!

Bridget: And we also have a jacuzzi and sauna, but old people
  shouldnt use the sauna because it raises the heart rate, and gives
  everyone else the willies!

C.J.: You're kidding! My God, these kids are animals. No wonder the
  Japanese beat us to the moon.

Bridget: And we both met great guys!
[... ]
Cate: So, Where'd you meet these guys?
Kerry, Bridget: [simultaneously] At the mall.
Cate: And, uh, what's their names?
Kerry, Bridget: [simultaneously] Tyler.

Rory: No one would take me to the mini-mart, so I drove myself.
  There's no law against that.

Kerry: [about Bridget] I can't believe she's president.
Max: Oh, *thank you*!
Max: I can't believe you two are sisters.
Kerry: Thank you.

Jim: Well, it looks like somebody's waiting for a boy to call.
Kerry: Oh no, there's no boy.
Bridget: And he's really cute.

[repeated line]
Cate: I swear to God, Paul!

Bridget: [watching Extreme Makeover] Oh my God Jan, you're pretty
  now!

Bridget: [to the tune of P-U-R-P-L-E, in the shower] Who's the girl
  with the pretty hair? Bridget! Bridget! Who's the girl that makes
  boys stare? Bridget Hennessy!
Bridget: Lather, rinse, repeat! Lather, rinse, repeat! Do it twice
  and the hair smells nice-lather, rinse, repeaaattt!
Bridget: Now onto the legs. Who's the girl with the pretty legs?
  Bridget! Bridget! Who's the girl that makes boys stare? Bridget
  Hennessy! [Kerry, listening to her, sighs and rolls her eyes]

Kyle: You know, they say that God is a comedian playing to an
  audience that's just afraid to laugh.
[everyone looks at him amazed]
Jim: Who said that?
Kyle: It's me, Kyle.

Cate: [during a very long ?family meeting? where Paul speaks
  seemingly endlessly] Uh, Paul, I have a turkey in the oven.
Paul: No, you don't.
Cate: If I did, it would be done by now.

Bridget: [on the phone to Donny Doyle] You have reached Bridget's
  voice mail. Please leave a message after the beep. 'Beeeeeeep.'
Kerry: That's never gonna work.
Bridget: [whispering] Shhhh! He's leaving a message.

Rory: Dad? It's happening to me again. My body is doing strange and
  beautiful things. I'm so confused.

Lacey: Break a leg
Bridget: Break a leg? Well, go get hit by a bus!

Bridget: I'll tell you what this is about! This is about me winning
  Jeremy and humiliating Lacey so bad that she has to hide her face
  and move to the Northern territory and live with the bears, until
  one day she starts riding the bear like a pony and it gets so mad
  that it turns around and eats her and it eats so much of her face
  that it starts to look like Lacey and all the other bears point and
  laugh and say, "Ha! Your face looks like Lacey's."

Bridget: [in shower] Who's the girl with the great hair? Bridget!
  Bridget! Who's the girl that makes boys stare? Bridget Hennessy!
  Lather, rinse, repeat! Lather, rinse, repeat! Do it twice and the
  hair smells nice - lather, rinse, repeat!

Kyle: Frogs are people too!

Cate: Hey, Rory! How did tennis go?
Rory: [sits on chair] Borin'.
Bridget: [walks in the door] Daddy broke my nose!
Rory: Oh, yeah. That.

Cate: First rule in old men fight club. We don't talk about old men
  fight club!

Gym Instructor: [to Rory] Are you having trouble with your proud
  warrior?

Paul: Hypothetically, how many kids would you say are sexually
  active?
Bridget: Define "sexually active."
Kerry: Do you want to be home schooled?
Bridget: Sorry. So I'd say: 1 in 3.
Kerry: Yeah, except the band kids.
Paul: The band kids?
Kerry: Yeah, they're like rabbits!
Bridget: Uh-huh.
Paul: Wow.

Paul: What were you and your mom talking about? Your face is all
  puffy.
Kerry: [sarcastically] Thanks.
Paul: Well, not the bad puffy.
Kerry: Oh, right, the good puffy! I just needed to talk to mom but
  I'm fine now.
Paul: OK, but if you need to talk... about anything... I'm here.
Kerry: Me and Jason broke up.
Paul: Did he dump you?
Kerry: It was mutual.
Paul: Oh, well, if you meant anything to him he'll call you.
Kerry: He hasn't called. [she starts to cry a little]
Paul: Well, give it a day, if you meant anything *at all* to him he
  will call.
Kerry: [starts to bawl] We broke up last week!
Bridget: [Bridget walks in, Kerry runs to her crying, Bridget gives
  her a hug] You talked to Dad? What were you thinking!
Cate: [comes down the stairs and sees Kerry crying] Paul!
Paul: She just needed a good cry.

Bridget: This is the best job I've ever had! I get paid to wear a
  bathing suit and sit on a throne.
Kerry: Aren't you supposed to be saving people from drowning?
Bridget: That's such a small part of what I do.

Bridget: Kerry is that my earrings?
Kerry: No.
Bridget: Oh my god, first you steal my popularity, then my earrings!
Kerry: You forgot your boyfriend.

Bridget: You know what, mom? We're really sorry, but you brought our
  principal back to the house!
Rory: Get use to it. He's her man toy now.

Cate: All right, look now. He's here because he had nowhere else to
  go. So, when he comes out I want everyone to say something nice.
Jim: Hey, your nose seems to have healed up nicely.

C.J.: Got a nice wing with your name on it.
Jim: Don't get carried away.

Cate: Look. I'm sorry. He's still upset because you took away his
  football.
Ed Gibb: Cate, he dropkicked it across the cafeteria and into a bath
  of chocolate pudding.
Cate: I'll go talk to him.

Ed Gibb: So, um. Need any help there?
Jim: Are you some kind of engineer?
Ed Gibb: No. I just...
Jim: So what then? You think I need some kind of help because I'm
  old?
Ed Gibb: No, I really...
Jim: Well, let me tell you somethin', college boy.
Ed Gibb: Hey hey hey, if you hit me again, I am not coming for
  Christmas.

Rory: Just throw the ball with me for five minutes.
C.J.: Do I look like I have time for tom-foolery?

Cate: Can I get you something?
Ed Gibb: No, no. I'm fine. I'm just watchin' the game.
Cate: You're watching a broken TV.
Ed Gibb: I'm a Lions fan. It's less painful this way.

Ed Gibb: You show me hospitality.
Jim: Out of my chair!

Bridget: Ew. Your filling sucks.
Kerry Hennessy: Yours smells like wet dog.

Cate: I am now refereeing a pie fight. I feel like the mother of
  Amish teens.

Cate: Uh, dad, maybe you wanna unplug that first.
Jim: Oh, relax Cate. These little zaps make me feel alive.
Jim: Fireflies!

Cate: Well, I guess we'll never know what happened.
C.J.: My guess, he started eating as a small child and never stopped.

Kerry: So, that's all you can think of to be thankful for? That you
  got the good hair?
Bridget: No, I said it's what I'm most thankful for.
Jim: And, what about you, Cate? What are you thankful for?
Cate: Well, I'm thankful for my wonderful children, and for my great
  dad and my mom even though she couldn't be here.
Jim: That's what I'm thankful for.

Kerry: [C.J. becoming first acquainted with the family] I suppose
  you're going to guess my weight, too.
C.J.: 101.

Kerry: Yeah, because that's your conundrum.
Kyle: Look Mrs. H it's been in my wallet for a year now and I haven't
  used it I swear.

Kerry: He's a baller
Travis "The Rainman": Holler!
Kerry: Holler back, brother
Travis "The Rainman": Yeaaaaaaah

Kerry: Don't objectify me!
Kyle: I wasn't, I was just staring at your body.

C.J.: [C.J. thinks that Kerry's date to the prom is a lesbian] I
  think Monica might "oh-won-ica".

Carter Tibbits: It's okay. It's family, music to my ears.
Cate Hennessy: So, where's your family tonight, Carter?
Carter Tibbits: Well, wife number one is in Aspen with my girls. Wife
  number two went back to Italy with my boys. And wife number four,
  my current wife, she's vacationing with her mother in Martha's
  Vineyard.
Paul Hennessy: What about wife number three?
Carter Tibbits: We don't ever talk about wife number three! But I
  love wife number four.
Bridget Hennessy: You know, aren't you a little young to have all of
  those wives? It sounds to me like you had some mother issues.
Paul Hennessy: Bridget!
Carter Tibbits: No, no, she may be onto somethin'. You know, when you
  grow up the eighth of nine kids, sometimes you can get lost in the
  shuffle. [Sad] Oh, mama, why didn't you love me? [Puts his face in
  his hands and pretends to cry. Paul goes over to comfort him. He
  points his hands at Paul, revealing that he was faking] Booyah!

Carter Tibbits: Paul, I thought my crew chief made everything clear.
  I can't trust a man who sneaks in my bedroom while I'm showering
  and plays with my stuff. I'm afraid you're dead to me, Paul. Just
  like a certain ex-wife whose number I will not mention. [Pats Rory
  on the shoulder] How're you doin' there, son?
Paul Hennessy: Now, Carter, I just want to set everything straight,
  and then you'll never hear from me again. I know that the book deal
  is dead. Is it? [Carter stares at him] I mean, right. No, no,
  that's neither here nor there, it's just... that I, I want you to
  know that I wasn't playing with your stuff. [he stares at Rory,
  Rory shakes his head "no". He goes back to looking at Carter] My
  son took something. I was putting it back.
Carter Tibbits: Well, isn't that somethin'. Blaming it on your own
  son!
Cody Grant: [From the other room, VO] Pitiful!
Paul Hennessy: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Wait! If you rewound the
  tape...
Carter Tibbits: You're not half the man that wife number three turned
  out to... [Stops himself, realizing he's said too much] I think you
  know where the door is.
Rory Hennessy: [He and Paul go towards the door, but Rory turns back
  for a moment] Mr. Tibbits, I stole that picture of you and movie
  legend, Paul Newman. My dad was just putting it back. I took it for
  a joke.
Carter Tibbits: There's nothin' funny about stealin', son.
Rory Hennessy: I know. It's just, my dad's so funny, and I was trying
  to be funny.
Paul Hennessy: Rory, why'd you take it so far?
Rory Hennessy: Because I wanted to impress you!
Carter Tibbits: Whoa! Whoa! Stealing to impress your father! You
  know, Rory, I run a program for at-risk youth, such as yourself...
Paul Hennessy: He's not at-risk!
Carter Tibbits: If I had a dime for every parent who ever said
  that...

Bridget Hennessy: I know it's hard. But, in order to accept it, you
  need to say it out loud. That's the first step to recovery. Now
  repeat after me: "It's not my fault". Say it.
Carter Tibbits: [a second screen pops up with him sitting on the
  couch in his room] I can't!
Bridget Hennessy: Come on! Say it! "It's not my fault".
Carter Tibbits: It's not... my... fault. Wife number three... was
  not... my... fault. Wait a minute! I know whose fault it was! Mama,
  why didn't you love me? [He puts his head in his hands. Bridget

# "8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter" (2002) {Goodbye: Part 2 (#2.5)}
Cate Hennessy: [reading Paul's last article] Okay readers, today
  we're having a little pop quiz, it's multiple choice, so sharpen
  your number 2 pencils and put your thinking caps on. Ready? Here's
  a quote: "Dad, you're an idiot." Now, contestants, this was said to
  me because of which of the following transgressions? A: Coming to
  the breakfast table wearing pajamas and black socks? B: Asking my
  oldest daughter if that guy I saw her talking to yesterday at
  school was her boyfriend? C: Referring to rapper Fiddy Cent as
  "Fifty Cents"? or D: Entering the room? Okay, pencils down.
  Actually it was a trick question. The answer is all of the above.
  Now do you know how many times I called my father an idiot? Zero.
  Why? Because I feared him. Back then we didn't share our deep
  personal feelings, our deepest conversations usually revolved
  around the tigers bull pen. But my kids, I can't get them to shut
  up! There's not a feeling that my kids are afraid to express over
  and over and over. And my wife reassures me this is a good thing
  over and over and over, and she's always right. So do I wish that
  my kids feared me? Well my house would be quieter, and I'd spend a
  lot less time in the bathroom, but no. Because I know that whenever
  they insult me whether it's a "You're an idiot," "You're a geek,"
  or an "I hate you," an "I love you" isn't far behind. And it's the
  knowledge that my wife and kids love me that makes it safe for me
  to wear pajamas and black socks to the breakfast table.

  maybe if I make some really big trims, I can get it down to
  forty-five minutes. What do you think?
Ryan Matthews: Are you out of your mind? Aim for ten, all right? We
  have other students in the class.
Erin Silver: You just lost your Oscar shout-out.
Ryan Matthews: Well, I'll survive.

Ryan Matthews: Hey, Kelly. It's Ryan. Listen, I need you to call me
  back. Uh... Silver made a film and, uh... yeah, I don't really
  wanna get into it on your machine. So just call me back. Okay.
[Ryan hangs his phone up and enters his apartment to find a smashed
  window and Silver waiting inside]
Ryan Matthews: Silver.
Erin Silver: You didn't think I'd put it together, did you?
Ryan Matthews: What? What are you doing...
Erin Silver: [growing more and more agitated] No! Just stop talking.
  Stop. It was a nice try, Matthews. You think that I'm dumb? Well,
  I'm not dumb. It took me a little while, but I figured out what you
  were up to. You said to me that you liked movies better than blogs.
  You think you could possibly be referring to the blog that I posted
  about you? Huh? I wonder. You never got over it, did you? You
  pretended to. You pretended to forgive me. You even invited me back
  into your classroom. All so that you could encourage me to make
  this movie. This was all a setup.
Ryan Matthews: Silver?
Erin Silver: No, stop! Drop the puppy-dog face. I'm over it. I know
  that you don't want me to succeed. All you wanted was revenge.
Ryan Matthews: [trying to calm Silver down] Listen to me. You know
  that's not true.
Erin Silver: You managed to turn Dixon against me. You managed to
  ruin my relationship, the one thing that I care the most about in
  this entire world!
Ryan Matthews: Wait, wait. Dixon?
Erin Silver: Stay away from me!
Ryan Matthews: Okay.
Erin Silver: Do you wanna know how I figured it out? Last night in
  the media lab, you said to me "Are you out of your mind?". And then
  tonight, Dixon just now said to me "Are you out of your mind?".
  That is not a coincidence! You got to Dixon! You told him lies
  about me! All so that you could teach me a lesson! What kind of
  teacher are you?
Ryan Matthews: Silver, listen...
[Silver throws a wine bottle against the wall]
Ryan Matthews: Okay! What do you want from me?
Erin Silver: I want you to fix all of this!

Dixon Wilson: Ooh, pancakes!
Annie Wilson: Throw me one.
Debbie Wilson: We do not throw food.

Debbie Wilson: Oh, I can pick you up tonight.
Annie Wilson: No, Silver's gonna give me a ride. I won't be home for
  dinner.
Dixon Wilson: Me too, peace.
Harry Wilson: Me, three. I've got a meeting with the teacher's union.

Dixon Wilson: Family night?
Annie Wilson: You want us to go bowling?
Harry Wilson: Yeah.
Debbie Wilson: Your dad and I would like to spend some time with you
  guys. I feel like we don't see each other anymore.
Annie Wilson: And we really, really want to hang out with you guys.
Dixon Wilson: Especially on a Friday night.
Annie Wilson: But... I have a date with Ty tomorrow night.
Dixon Wilson: And Navid's dad is showing the new Bond movie. Come on.
Debbie Wilson: Well, your dad and I have tickets to the Hollywood
  Bowl, but we're not going.
Harry Wilson: No, we're not.
Debbie Wilson: Because we want to spend time with you guys.

Erin Silver: [to Kelly about Ryan] I think he has a crush on you.
Kelly Taylor: Oh, God, no. No, no, no, no. We're colleagues. I would
  never go out...
Erin Silver: Good. This school's hard enough as it is without my
  sister banging the teacher.

Annie Wilson: [to Silver] Hey, where were you today? I was looking
  for you at school.
Erin Silver: Fell asleep behind the biology lab.

Ryan Matthews: [to Kelly] I'm sorry I was late. Traffic was a
  nightmare. You know, this guy wouldn't move. I think I hit a
  squirrel. Did you get stuck in that?
Kelly Taylor: No, I live just down the street. I walked here.

Dixon Wilson: [to Silver] So, Ms. Silver, do you know how to bowl or
  you know, are you too cool for that kind of thing?
Erin Silver: I'm gonna kick your ass.

Naomi Clark: [to Adrianna] Baby, you sound pitchy.
Adrianna Duncan: [to Naomi] You sound bitchy.

Dixon Wilson: Silver? What's going on?
Erin Silver: I've been staying at the women's shelter for a few weeks
  now. I did some community service there this past summer and
  there's this woman who... she lets me stay there sometimes. Sort of
  knows my situation. My mom, she drinks. When she's like this, she's
  a completely different person. It's like, she screams, she throws
  things, she blames me. Sometimes she gets so out of control. I
  don't know... sometimes it scares me.

Erin Silver: Dixon, I didn't tell you so you would tell your dad. I'm
  already enough of a freak at school. I don't want all the other
  kids to know my mom's a drunk, too.

Dixon Wilson: [to Silver] You don't think I know what you're going
  through? I didn't grow up in the Cosby family. You think every
  other family I lived with was like this? No! I know what it's like
  to be around someone who's wasted out of their mind! I know what
  that stuff does to people. That's why I never do it myself. Silver,
  look, you gotta trust my dad or at least trust me.

Harry Wilson: Okay, well, Silver, you will stay here tonight. And as
  far as we're concerned, until we get this figured out.
Annie Wilson: Yeah, she can stay in my room.
Dixon Wilson: She can stay in my room. [everyone smiles] Just trying
  to help.

Naomi Clark: [to Tracy] I went to Dad's office last night and I saw
  him kissing another woman. He was all over her. I'm so sorry, Mom.
Tracy Clark: Her name is Gail. I know all about her.
Naomi Clark: He's been seeing her for two years?
Tracy Clark: Honey, she doesn't live in town, so they don't see each
  other very often.
Naomi Clark: What's going on? Are you ending it? Are you getting a
  divorce?
Tracy Clark: No, I don't want to break up this family.
Naomi Clark: Mom, this isn't a family!
Tracy Clark: Honey, Dad and I have a long history together, okay? We
  have two kids, two homes, friends. We have a life together.
Naomi Clark: Mom, what kind of life is this?
Naomi Clark: Oh, sweetheart... it's one that I don't want to lose.

Jackie Taylor: [to Kelly] You can imagine my surprise when you called
  to say you were coming after. Well, how long has it been since our
  last altercation?
Kelly Taylor: I came to talk about Silver, Mom.
Jackie Taylor: Well, Erin is not here right now. She's staying at a
  friend's house, Naomi's, I think, or...
Kelly Taylor: Are you kidding me? Is that what you think? She hasn't
  been staying at a friend's house. She's been sleeping at a shelter.
Jackie Taylor: Well, she told me... oh, how dare you give me that
  look. I didn't know.
Kelly Taylor: Why is that? Were you too drunk to notice? What is
  these days, Mom? Alcohol? Or are you back on coke?
Jackie Taylor: Oh, let's go to another meeting together again. Let's
  hold hands and give it up to our higher power.

Jackie Taylor: Your sister is just leaving, Erin.
Kelly Taylor: Yes, I am, and I am taking her with me.
Jackie Taylor: You have a 4-year-old with nobody to help you unless
  by some miracle he has decided to come back and act like a dad, and
  now you want to add a teenager on top of it. Let me tell you, she
  is no walk in the park.
Kelly Taylor: Well, she's coming to live with me. [to Silver] Let's
  go.
Jackie Taylor: You lied to me and now you're gonna leave me?
Erin Silver: Mom! Stop it, both of you! Mom, I can't take this
  anymore. I can't just watch you...
Jackie Taylor: [to Silver] Oh, get out! I am tired of both of you.
  [Silver runs away]
Kelly Taylor: Good job, Mom.

Adrianna Duncan: Ethan, you've got to help. Naomi's freaking out in
  the parking lot.
Annie Wilson: What? What's wrong?
Adrianna Duncan: She saw her father with another woman. It's crazy.

Ty Collins: [to Annie] So you're blowing me off tonight for bowling?
Annie Wilson: Oh, God, my parents are making me.
Ty Collins: That sucks.

Kelly Taylor: [about her son] He's only four and he is reading all
  these words. I'm sure that this is really boring to you.
Ryan Matthews: No, it's your son, it's fascinating. I love kids, you
  know. I teach kids, I flunk kids, I want to strangle them
  sometimes.

Navid Shirazi: [to Dixon] Dude, it's simple. Just tell your parents
  that you don't want to go.
Dixon Wilson: Look, I'm not trying to hurt their feelings, man. Just
  come to the bowling alley, tell them the thing about the movie.
  There's no way they won't let me go.
Navid Shirazi: You sure it'll work?
Dixon Wilson: You know what? Bring a lot of people. It'll be harder
  for them to say no.
Navid Shirazi: Peer pressure. Got it.

Ryan Matthews: [to Kelly] I'm just going to do this. [kisses her] Now
  are we dating?
Kelly Taylor: Oh, what the hell.

[passing by Erin's locker]
Kelly Taylor: [covering her face with her folder] If I don't see you,
  I don't know you're late. If I don't know you're late, I don't have
  to give you a late slip.


# "90210" (2008) {Model Behavior (#1.6)}
Ethan Ward: [to Naomi] Are you gonna be staring at your Sidekick all
  night?
Naomi Clark: [to Ethan] Are you gonna be staring at the fake boobs
  all night?

Erin Silver: Do you know I actually almost started believing that
  guy?
Dixon Wilson: Hey, that guy is a pig, but he was right about one
  thing. You are definitely the most beautiful girl in the room
  tonight.

Kelly Taylor: [to Silver] And I talked to your dad. He has a room
  ready and he's waiting for you.
Erin Silver: You're kidding, right? I am not going to go stay with
  Mel and his latest child bride. I think that girl is actually in my
  homeroom.

Brenda Walsh: Adrianna, you are a fantastic actress and if you choose
  to, you're gonna have great success, but there's plenty of time for
  that. Maybe you should take a little bit of pressure off of
  yourself right now.
Adrianna Tate: Do you really think I want to end up like you, acting
  in some tragic theater company directing high school musicals in my
  spare time? No, thanks.

Annie Wilson: [about Adrianna] God, what is her problem?
Harry Wilson: She is having a rough time.
Annie Wilson: Yeah, but so is everybody else. It's called high
  school.

Naomi Clark: [to Ethan about her dad] The minute he got in the same
  room with my mom, they ended up in bed together. What does that
  tell you?
Ethan Ward: That they're still horny?
Naomi Clark: No, that they still have feelings for each other.

Navid Shirazi: [to Dixon] Dude, you've been in Beverly Hills like 10
  minutes and you already have a girlfriend. You know what that makes
  me?
Dixon Wilson: A loser?
Navid Shirazi: No, a third wheel.

Erin Silver: [to Dixon and Navid] Listen, I'm gonna let you guys just
  hug this out while I go try to blog Navid a whole new wheel.

Adrianna Tate: [to Annie] You stole my part in the play.
Annie Wilson: Adrianna, I was your understudy. I had to go on. You on
  the other hand did not have to sleep with Ty.
Adrianna Tate: Then why are you helping me?
Annie Wilson: Because unlike you, I'm actually a nice person.

Ryan Matthews: Annie, where's Adrianna?
Annie Wilson: Oh, you know, she's just off cooking her next little
  psychotic plan to ruin my life.

Naomi Clark: [to Ethan] Now my parents will never get back together.
Ethan Ward: Maybe that's not such a bad thing.
Naomi Clark: How can you say that?
Ethan Ward: Some people aren't just meant to be together.

Kelly Taylor: [to Silver] Hey, kiddo. How was the party?
Erin Silver: Oh, you know. Dreams built up and shattered. Typical
  night in Hollywood.

Tom Marino: [to Silver] How about I get my driver to take us back to
  my house in the Hills and we can plot the world domination of
  Silver in my Jacuzzi?
Erin Silver: You're kidding, right? Do you know how old I am?
Tom Marino: Oh, age to me is more of a state of mind.
Erin Silver: Yeah, well, in the state of California, it's 15 to 20
  hard time.

Tom Marino: [to Silver] Now I thought the modeling world was not for
  you.
Erin Silver: Morbid fascination. I was dragged here kicking and
  screaming.

[after a fight between Tom Marino and Dixon]
Debbie Wilson: Antonio, I'm so sorry. If you want to fire me, I
  totally understand.
Antonio Garrett: Ahh, please. You were defending your son. Life's too
  short to work with people like that. And you're too talented not to
  keep around.
Debbie Wilson: Thank you.


# "90210" (2008) {Mother Dearest (#3.8)}
Navid Shirazi: [going surfing with Dixon and Liam] I didn't expect to
  see you here. Got a day off from driving Miss Daisy?
Liam Court: Daisy took a cab. She's got a full afternoon of "purse
  business". She knows the rules, man. I deal with her, but not the
  drugs.
Dixon Wilson: I still can't believe that girl deals, man. It's not
  even like she needs the money. I swear, I'll never understand rich
  kids.
Liam Court: Trying to understand rich kids is like trying to
  understand LeBron James. The more you talk about it, the angrier
  you get.


# "90210" (2008) {Okaeri, Donna! (#1.19)}
Ryan Matthews: [trying to get volunteers for his Habitat for Humanity
  trip] Don't any of you want to do something different every once in
  a while? You know, experience something you haven't experienced
  before? Uh... learn something about yourselves?
Ethan Ward: I'll sign up.
Naomi Clark: [curiously] Seriously?
Ryan Matthews: [surprised] Seriously?
Ethan Ward: Why not? I wanna experience things I've never experienced
  before. Take a risk for a change.

Kelly Taylor: Okay, it's time for your mood chart. Let's see here,
  it's 9:30. What is your mood?
Erin Silver: Irritated.
Kelly Taylor: Okay, irritated. How irritated, on a scale of one to
  ten?
Erin Silver: Well, I was at a four. But you asked me that, brought me
  up to a six.
Kelly Taylor: Six. Okay, then. How would you like to spend your time
  before bed? Would you like to journal?
Erin Silver: No, I would not like to journal. Nor would I like to use
  the word "journal" as a verb.

Harry Wilson: [Dixon and Annie are gone for Spring Break] So, just
  you and me.
Debbie Wilson: Mmm-hmm.
Harry Wilson: How will we pass the time? Oh, I got an idea.
[Harry climbs onto the kitchen table]
Harry Wilson: Sex. Lots of sex, starting now.
Debbie Wilson: Starting later.
Harry Wilson: No, no, no.
Debbie Wilson: I have an assignment for my photography class. I have
  to line up a nude model.
Harry Wilson: Hubba hubba.
Debbie Wilson: Really? That's your response?
Harry Wilson: One "hubba" too many?
[Debbie laughs]

Naomi Clark: If I said to someone "I can't wait to spend alone time
  together", and that person said to me "That's an oxymoron", what do
  you think that person meant?
Ethan Ward: Uh... that it's an oxymoron to be alone together.

[Donna finishes a phone conversation while driving with Kelly]
Kelly Taylor: Very impressive, Donna. And also illegal. You're not
  allowed to drive and talk on the phone at the same time anymore
  without a Bluetooth.
Donna Martin: Are you serious?

Diablo Cody: Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt. I just have to say I love
  your dress.
Donna Martin: Oh, thank you.
Diablo Cody: I just spent like the whole morning trooping around
  stores looking for something to wear to this premiere party. Your
  dress is the first thing I've seen that I actually like.
Kelly Taylor: You're Diablo Cody, right?
Diablo Cody: Yeah.
[Donna looks confused]
Kelly Taylor: Diablo Cody. She wrote "Juno".
Donna Martin: Sorry. Uh, maybe it didn't come to Japan?
Diablo Cody: Oh, no, it did. But they called it "Teenage Mommy Girl".
Donna Martin: No! You wrote "Teenage Mommy Girl"? I loved that movie.
Diablo Cody: Thank you. I love your dress.

  you think you're going to steal my boyfriend, it's not going to
  happen.
[Emily begins quietly sobbing again]
Annie Wilson: [scoffs] Oh. And spare me the tears, Emily, 'cause I'm
  not buying it.
Emily Bradford: [breaking character] Fine! Cards up. All my life,
  I've looked up to you. And when I moved out here, all I wanted was
  to be friends with you, but you wouldn't let me in. You looked down
  on me, ignored me, and you basically told Dixon and Aunt Deb that I
  was a stalker. Yeah, I head that. And now the tables have turned.
  So who wants to "Single White Female" who?
Annie Wilson: People are going to find out what a psychotic,
  manipulative, crazy bitch you are, 'cause I'm going to tell them.
Emily Bradford: Go ahead. Who do you think they're going to believe?
  You, or innocent little Emily?
[begins sobbing again]

Tabitha Wilson: I have to remember some of those breathing exercises
  I used to do. I had a director who'd say, "If you're not breathing
  from your ass and reaching to the skies, the back row won't hear
  you." I slept with him.

Naomi Clark: Hi, Mom. Where are we going for dinner tonight?
Tracy Clark: I made reservations at Craft.
Naomi Clark: Is Dad coming?
Tracy Clark: He has a meeting.
Naomi Clark: Is that code for "sleeping with his girlfriend"?

Naomi Clark: Mom, how can you live like this? How can you just accept
  that Dad's with another woman. How is that okay? Can you explain
  that to me? 'Cause i just don't get it.
Tracy Clark: It's just a casual fling, that's all. She doesn't even
  live here.
Naomi Clark: So what, Mom? He's still cheating on you.
Tracy Clark: This is between me and your dad. Stay out of it. I'm not
  discussing this with you again.

Naomi Clark: [to Silver] Please don't blog about my dad's affair.
Erin Silver: You thought my family problems were gossip. Why
  shouldn't I treat yours the same way?

Tabitha Wilson: Just because you're a bunch of rich brats doesn't
  mean you can't have angst.

Annie Wilson: [when she finds out Dixon's working at the Peach Pit]
  You're working here?
Dixon Wilson: Yeah.
Annie Wilson: Are you trying to make me look bad with Mom and Dad?
Dixon Wilson: No, I'm trying to make me look good.

Ty Collins: [to Annie] What's this?
Annie Wilson: Snickerdoodles. They're apology cookies. When I do
  something screwed up, I bake.

Naomi Clark: [to Ethan] Think we can start over?
Ethan Ward: What do you mean?
Naomi Clark: All I know is I miss those two people who went to the
  zoo and ate cotton candy, and were silly and happy together.
Ethan Ward: So you're saying... you want to get back together?
Naomi Clark: I'm saying take it day by day. See what happens.
Ethan Ward: I can do that.

Debbie Wilson: Harry, how hard can it be to find an acting coach in
  LA? I could throw a rock through a window and hit an actor.

Naomi Clark: My family is so fake. I mean, my sister's being
  Photoshopped into the Christmas card from Paris. My dad is kissing
  my mom while having an affair.

Erin Silver: [to Dixon] You hit that guy's car, almost got him in
  trouble, and then he asks you to a game?
Dixon Wilson: It's nothing. I've seen guys fist-fight and then five
  minutes later, they're hanging out.
Erin Silver: That's crazy.
Dixon Wilson: Yeah, you know, guys aren't girls. We don't hold
  grudges. Life is way too short.

Erin Silver: [to Dixon] Those dimples are not gonna get you into

Dixon Wilson: I'm a black kid living with a white family. It doesn't

  I wanted to have sex, there are plenty of band girls who want me. I

Adrianna Duncan: Well, then I'd be in a movie, make lots of money.
Ryan Matthews: So what, you can buy a new cell phone or maybe a fancy
  pair of shoes? Maybe an expensive car you don't really need?
Adrianna Duncan: No, so I can pay the mortgage 'cause my mom can't.

Erin Silver: [to Annie] Okay, what was that?
Annie Wilson: What?
Erin Silver: What? Ty Collins just practically put his tongue in your
  mouth. That's what.
Annie Wilson: Shut up!
Annie Wilson: Okay, you are obviously too messed up to see what's
  right in front of you, so let me be your eyes. Ty Collins is into
  you? You should be into Ty Collins or so to speak.
Annie Wilson: Okay, can you just give me one second because my old
  relationship ended 6 hours ago.
Erin Silver: Okay, the cure for a breakup is a hookup.

  thing ever. It's like "Pretty Woman", but I'm not a whore.

Annie Wilson: [to Silver] Hey, cool tattoo. What does it mean?
Erin Silver: It's the Chinese symbol for friendship 'cause you know,
  friends are cool.
Annie Wilson: Naomi has the same one.
Erin Silver: Yeah. All right, in 8th grade, my dad had an affair with
  my mom's best friend. I was... God, I was so angry you know, so
  unbelievably scared she'd find out, you know and she'd get a
  divorce or start drinking again. So, I... I didn't tell anybody, I
  kept it a secret, but then it started eating away at me, and I
  just... I had to tell someone. So I told my friend, Naomi. She
  promised me that she wouldn't tell anyone, so she told everyone.
Annie Wilson: Why would she do that?
Erin Silver: Because she needs to know more than anyone else. Because
  it gives her power to tear people down. So, my mom found out. She
  confronted my dad and everything that I prayed wouldn't happen
  happened. So now it's my greatest pleasure to make her pay for it.

Harry Wilson: [to Dixon] And I want to apologize to you. Wasn't fair
  of me to ask you to give up your buddies. I was on a team once. I
  know how it works.
Dixon Wilson: You know, I'm sorry I disobeyed you, you know? I'm
  still trying to find my way around here, you know?
Harry Wilson: I'm trying to figure out when to be principal and when
  to be your dad.
Dixon Wilson: You know, I think I like my dad more than my principal.
Harry Wilson: You might not when you hear his punishment.

Harry Wilson: And this thing with Tracy, I wish I knew what to do,
  but I don't. And am I curious to know the kid's okay? Absolutely.
  But being an adoptive father, would I want Dixon's birth parents
  around us? No way.
Debbie Wilson: Well, look, Dixon is a teenager. This is a man. But,
  before you do anything about that, I think you really need to
  figure out how you want to handle things with Tracy.
Harry Wilson: I don't know and I am the first to admit I was not the
  greatest guy back then.
Debbie Wilson: Honestly, I'm more concerned about the guy you are
  now. So just take your time and figure out how you want to handle
  this.

Annie Wilson: What do you mean you're curious?
Liam Court: Well, I don't know. You throw a bridal shower for
  something you don't feel like celebrating. You act like a good
  girl, but in fact... you're not. You are a volcano.
Annie Wilson: What?
Liam Court: You're dormant now, but there's stuff percolating. You
  have frustration, anger, rage, and jealousy building up inside you.
  This whole good girl routine, the smile that you paste on your
  face... it's just a mask. When you finally can't take it anymore of
  the things around you... and you will explode... oh, it's going to
  be fantastic. Who doesn't want to watch a volcano explode, huh?

Charles Clark: So, I assume you're here because the Wilsons have had
  enought of your shenanigans. I forgive you. And of course you can
  come home. In fact, I need you to. These are tough times for the

  harassed Portia's mother...
Charles Clark: [interupting] Allegely. I'm a family man, Naomi. I
  value family, morals, clean living.
Naomi Clark: [laughs] What the hell?
Jen Clark: [enters] Don't blaspheme, Naomi.
Charles Clark: Jen, you're home!
Jen Clark: Sorry I haven't called, Daddy.
Charles Clark: How's school?
Jen Clark: Well, I'm learning lots. I just took time off so I figure
  I'd come visit the old homestead.
Charles Clark: [stammering] Well... things are tough, but I'm so glad
  you're here. You can stay with me and Gail and Naomi of course.
  How's that for a plan?
Jen Clark: Oh, I'm glad we're here too. But there is no way on Earth
  I'm going to rally around some narcissistc, freaky, old sexual
  degenerate just because he happens to be my father. And neither is
  Naomi. So, I have a slightly different plan. I think Naomi should
  get the first installment of her trust fund... right now. I mean,
  there's no reason she should have to wait until she's 21 like I
  did. And there's certainly no reason she should have to live with
  you and you... and "Gail".
Charles Clark: That's ridicoulous. Naomi's only 16. She can't sign a
  lease for a house.
Jen Clark: But I can. Naomi and I are going to live together.
Charles Clark: Why should I agree to that?
Jen Clark: Two words. Michele Braverman.
Naomi Clark: [to Jen] Who's Michele Braverman?
Jen Clark: She was my tennis pro when I was 16. Quite an attractive
  girl. 16-years-old like I was. Ruddy, robust, very... healthy,
  wasn't she, Daddy? Now you give me the money, and we'll play the
  dutiful daughters and I will not tell the press about another
  incident in your past that you'd want to cover up.
Charles Clark: [intimidated] Fine. I'll have my business manager send
  you the papers in the morning.

Ozzie: My friend bet me 50 bucks that I couldn't get you to dance
  with me. I'll split it with you.
Naomi Clark: I'll give you a hundred to go away now.

Debbie Wilson: [teaching Annie how to drive] Okay, remember to fasten
  your seatbelt, make sure your mirrors are adjusted.
Annie Wilson, Debbie Wilson: And your parking brake is off.
Annie Wilson: I got it.
Debbie Wilson: And?
Annie Wilson: And... and don't play the radio too loud, don't drive
  when tired, and don't get distracted by the other kids in the car.
Debbie Wilson: So, did Ethan finally ask you to homecoming?
Annie Wilson: [short snort of laughter] Way to slip that one in. Um,
  kind of. We're going to hang when we get there, but we're not
  actually going together.
Debbie Wilson: Annie. I just distracted you.
Annie Wilson: Oh, well that was sneaky!
Debbie Wilson: That's my point.

[Ryan caught Kimberly buying drugs at homecoming]
Harry Wilson: I will take these.
Ryan Matthews: And?
Harry Wilson: Take care of it.
Ryan Matthews: That's it?
Harry Wilson: And you can go now.
Ryan Matthews: No, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me exactly
  what is gonna happen, okay? She comes into my classroom...
Harry Wilson: [interrupting] Ryan, I told you before to stay out of
  this.
Ryan Matthews: Yeah, and maybe that's why the problem's getting
  worse, Harry.
Harry Wilson: I got it covered.
Ryan Matthews: Really? You have it covered? That's why there's dogs
  running around, sniffing lockers at school. And you busted the
  wrong kid, and now you've got kids buying drugs at dances, okay?
Harry Wilson: Can you please keep your voice down?
Ryan Matthews: No, I'm not going to keep my voice down, all right?
  I'm tired of this crap. You don't know how to deal with these kids,
  and you don't know how to protect them, and I'm going to the board.
  'Cause you don't know what you're doing. Okay? And if they don't
  listen, I'm going to the L.A. Times.
Kimberly MacIntyre: Oh, for God's sakes. I'm a cop, you dumbass.
Ryan Matthews: [pause] What?

Debbie Wilson: If you ever kiss my husband again, or touch him, or
  look at him in the wrong way, you and I will have a very big
  problem.
Tracy Clark: [sarcastically] Gosh, I don't know how I would get
  through the day knowing that you were angry at me.
Debbie Wilson: Let me define "big problem", just so we're clear: I
  will hit you in the face so hard, I will knock your teeth out. You
  enjoy the rest of your evening, Tracy. I know I will.

Annie Wilson: You don't think I "should"?
Harry Wilson: No, you shouldn't.
Debbie Wilson: I know you don't agree on this, but we want what's
  best for you.
Annie Wilson: Is it because of that stupid rumor that Navid told
  Dixon that Jasper is a drug dealer? You really believe it?
Harry Wilson: Obviously that concerns us. We know Navid. We trust
  him.
Annie Wilson: But it's a lie!
Debbie Wilson: It's more than just the rumor. Jasper is just so...
  odd.
Annie Wilson: How can you say that? You don't even know him.
Debbie Wilson: He doesn't have any friends.
Annie Wilson: That's because all the kids at our school suck!
Harry Wilson: Annie!
Annie Wilson: It's true! Jasper is just a lonely and misunderstood
  guy who's been shunned by everyone because they don't know him.
  He's someone I can relate to. He's the only one I feel comfortable
  around.
Debbie Wilson: Annie, you're not yourself when you're around Jasper.
  You're nothing like him. You're not an outcast or a rebel.
Annie Wilson: You're wrong! You have no idea who I am anymore!

  you. I mean, come on. You're a cute girl. Dudes are gonna be
  throwing themselves at you.
Annie Wilson: Oh, please. You had, like a million friends.
Dixon Wilson: There, back home, and they all knew, you know? About
  the whole adoption story? Just don't want to have to tell my story
  over and over and over again.
Annie Wilson: Then don't. All they need to know is that you're my
  brother. That's my story.

Annie Wilson: [to Dixon] Aren't you a little freaked out starting
  over at a new school? And, like a week late?
Dixon Wilson: What are you worried about? You already got, like a
  boyfriend out here.

Annie Wilson: Dad, I still can't believe you grew up in a house like
  this.
Dixon Wilson: I can't believe you ever left.

[first lines]
Dixon Wilson: This sucks.
Debbie Wilson: Dixon, how about a new phrase like "this bites" or
  "this blows"? because you've been saying "this sucks" for the last
  1,500 miles.
Dixon Wilson: 'Cause it sucks.

Harry Wilson: Your mother and I have given up a lot for this move,
  too.
Annie Wilson: Really? Have you given up your boyfriend and the lead
  in the school play?
Harry Wilson: As a matter of fact, I have. He's heartbroken about it
  and so am I.
Annie Wilson: You're such a dork.

Annie Wilson: Grandma!
Dixon Wilson: [uneasy tone] You know... I've seen one of her old
  movies on Showtime the other night, right? Some 1980s
  romance-drama.
Annie Wilson: So? She's got a lot of her old movies on TV.
Dixon Wilson: In one scene, she was naked... frontal nudity. It's
  just not right.

Tabitha Wilson: [to Debbie] You wanna help? Go yell at the gardener
  for parking his crap wagon in my driveway.
Debbie Wilson: Actually, that's our crap wagon, Tabitha.
Tabitha Wilson: Well, then park it around the corner so the neighbors
  won't notice.

Erin Silver: [to Annie] I'm Silver.
Annie Wilson: Silver?
Erin Silver: Well, you can call me Erin, but I'm not gonna respond.
  So look, I wasn't plannig on making you feel welcome here, but then
  I saw the sticker and I thought, "Hey, maybe the principal's
  daughter isn't such a big loser after all."

Tabitha Wilson: [to Dixon] Did you kick his ass?
Harry Wilson: Mom.
Tabitha Wilson: What? That's not the first thing you thought of when
  you heard he was in a fight. Then maybe that's why he lost.
Dixon Wilson: I didn't lose.
Tabitha Wilson: Never worry about being fair. Just grab onto those
  jewels and twist them like a garbage bag.

Harry Wilson: [to Dixon] Look, I'm gonna talk to your coach tomorrow.
  We'll get this all worked out.
Debbie Wilson: And make sure he's not too rough on our baby.
Annie Wilson: Yeah, 'cause he is such a delicate flower.

Erin Silver: It's not that I don't like her. I hate her. Naomi is the
  Antichrist.
Annie Wilson: Well, the Antichrist didn't trash me in front of half a
  million people. You did.

Kelly Taylor: Silver, how many times have we had a talk about this
  blog of yours? All it does is cause problems.
Erin Silver: Yeah, well, that's what blogs are supposed to do. Cause
  problems. You know, you can't make me stop. It's not like it's a
  school activity or...
Kelly Taylor: Okay, I'm not talking to you as the guidance counselor
  right now. I am talking to you as your sister.
Erin Silver: Okay, then as my sister, you know what Naomi did and why
  I hate her.
Kelly Taylor: Yes, but this didn't hurt Naomi. It hurt Annie. Come
  on, you've got to let go of that anger. It's not doing you any
  good. You don't want to end up like Mom.

Naomi Clark: I cannot belive you told your dad everything! Are you
  kidding me?
Annie Wilson: I didn't tell him anything. He recognized the paper.
  Mr. Matthews could tell, too. I gave you my old term paper so you
  could take notes off it and get ideas on how to write your own
  paper, not to copy the entire thing word for word. My dad
  confronted me with both papers in his hands. What was I supposed to
  do?
Naomi Clark: Lie. Cry. Threaten him. Make something up. Be creative.
Annie Wilson: You sound like a spoiled brat.
Naomi Clark: Well, you sound like a little bitch! And just so we're
  simply clear, you are completely disinvited to my birthday party!

Naomi Clark: Mother, why are you still in bed?
Tracy Clark: Why aren't you at school?
Naomi Clark: Because school let out. It's been 9 hours since I said
  "I love you" and "bye." I was standing here in the doorway,
  remember? You were laying in bed, being pathetic.

Tabitha Wilson: Men of the theater are bon vivants, dear. One day,
  they're fumbling with your bra in the back of a '52 Chevy and the
  next, they're off to Mykonos to set up house with a stagehand named
  Phillip.

Debbie Wilson: [to Annie] You want to talk about it?
Annie Wilson: No, I would rather hit myself repeatedly with a hammer.

Naomi Clark: [to Tracy] This is all Dad's stuff.
Tracy Clark: You bet it is.
Naomi Clark: What are you doing with it?
Tracy Clark: Giving it to the Malibu mission. So one day soon, your
  father will step out of his beach house and see a homeless man
  wearing his tailor-fit Armani and he will think of me.

Annie Wilson: [to Silver] And I told my mom who turned it into an
  after-school special sex talk.
Erin Silver: What's an after-school special?
Annie Wilson: Google it.

Brenda Walsh: Silver, what are you doing?
Erin Silver: Nothing, paying attention. Sorry. Checking my blog. Big
  in Bolivia. Who knew?

Tabitha Wilson: [sees Debbie and Harry kissing] Sometimes I ask the
  Lord to take my sight away.

Charles Clark: What's going on, Tracy?
Tracy Clark: Well, let's see. Last time I checked, you left your wife
  and daughter for a life at the beach with your longtime whore. Did
  I leave anything out?

Annie Wilson: I like Ty. A lot.
Debbie Wilson: You said the same thing about Jason in the "King and
  I."
Annie Wilson: Yeah, well, Jason was big and sweet, and Kansas. Ty is
  tall and skinny, and cool, and he's got these ears that stick out
  like little elves.

Brenda Walsh: All right, Silver, you're the stage manager. What are
  you gonna do?
Erin Silver: [screams loudly] Has anybody seen Adrianna?

Naomi Clark: [to Annie] Hey, what's going on?
Annie Wilson: What's going on is I came here tonight fully prepared
  to have sex for the first time. Here I am at the "Roosevelt" in
  Hollywood about to give it up for the first time to some guy that I
  barely know. This whole world that you guys live in might be fine
  for the two of you and all of your friends with all of their
  benefits, but it is definitely not fine with me.

Erin Silver: [to Dixon] You know, you actually did a pretty good job
  tonight, Dixon.
Dixon Wilson: Well, thank you, thank you. Back at you.
Erin Silver: Whatever.
Dixon Wilson: Is there anything in this whole world that you actually
  do care about?
Erin Silver: I cared that your sister got through her performance
  without knocking over any set pieces.

# "90210" (2008) {Zero Tolerance (#1.23)}
Jen Clark: Didn't you and Ryan date?
Kelly Taylor: Yes, briefly, a while ago.
Jen Clark: I thought so. I'm rarely wrong about vibes. You know, I
  think academics are terribly sexy. And I don't get to mean
  teachers. When I was at Yale, I briefly dated someone in the
  registar's office.
Kelly Taylor: You don't say.
Jen Clark: He was pretty much a bore, actually. Although I did get to
  read my... uh, recommendation letters from high school. That was
  sweet. Most of them were rather glowing. There was one, though that
  was slightly less glowing.
Kelly Taylor: I wrote that letter to Yale because it's my job to give
  the colleges an honest appraisal of the students here.
Jen Clark: Uh-huh. You said that in your opinion, I was "a
  narcissistic sociopath with no moral compass". Did you really think
  that Yale was going to listen to you? A guidance counselor?
  Especially, after I told all of them how you hold an irrational
  grudge against me? I had an impeccable transcript. I was the
  president of the senior class. I'm a legacy. I got in early.
Kelly Taylor: That's because you stole Liz Hartigan's term paper and
  passed it off as your own.
Jen Clark: [makes a wicked smirk] Oh God, are you still going on
  about that? You're like Ahab. Man, you are such a busybody.
Kelly Taylor: Drop the innocent act, okay? You may have fooled Yale
  and everyone else here, but you can't fool me because I know what
  kind of person you really are. Self-centered, devious, willing to
  do whatever it takes to get what you want.
Jen Clark: [continues to sneer] Take it easy, okay? I haven't even
  slept with Ryan yet.
Kelly Taylor: No, this has nothing to do with Ryan. It has to do with
  you stealing that girl's term paper right out of a teacher's desk
  and submitting it as your own so you could beat her out as class
  valedictorian.
Jen Clark: [continues to talk in a innocent and charming tone] That
  was never proven. Plus, I am appalled that you think so little of
  me. Simply appalled. Do you make stuff up like that all the time
  just so you can feel secure? Oh hey, being that you're a guidance
  counselor, maybe you can give me a little guidance about Ryan. Tell
  me, Miss Taylor, what does he like in bed?
[beat and angry, Kelly walks out]

Kelly Taylor: Can I talk to you for a second?
Ryan Matthews: Sure. What's up?
Kelly Taylor: Uh, there is something you should know. Jen is not a
  nice person. I know her pretty well. She's a compulsive liar. She's
  practically a sociopath. She used to have everybody snowed over
  while she went to school here, but not me.
Ryan Matthews: Look, I'm sorry. I should have asked you if I could
  bring a date here tonight. Jen told me that you would say something
  like this about her. I didn't mean to disrespect you, Kelly.
Kelly Taylor: Wait. No, no, no, no...
Ryan Matthews: [cutting her off] I don't want to hear any more. I
  just... I though we were cool after that night and you know, we
  said no strings attached.
Kelly Taylor: You know what? I'm not trying to be jealous. I'm trying
  to be your friend. I'm not intrested in you anymore. I'm not.
Ryan Matthews: Is there someone else?
[Kelly sees that there's no getting through to the skeptic Ryan
  anymore]

Lawyer: Well, m'lud, it's...
Judge: Yes?
Lawyer: It's... um... an illicit practice whereby one person...

Lawyer: Whereby one person frangilates another's slimp, m'lud.

Lawyer: He or she gratifies the other person by... smuctating them

Stephen: We're going to leave you with tonight's cocktail recipe.
  This one's called "A Slow Snog With A Distant Relative". For this
  you'll need two measures of brandy, three of rum. One measure pink
  gin, one white. A dash of lemonade, a sprint of orange-juice, a
  spoonful of crushed Sugar Puffs, two hard-boiled eggs and an
  open-toed sandal, size nine if you can get it. Hit it, Mr Laurie,
  if you'd be so very kind.
[Hugh strikes up a jazzy sort of riff while Stephen mixes a "Slow
  Snog With A Distant Relative", spilling drinks everywhere]

Hugh: Then I was Princess Anne's assistant for a while, but I chucked
  that in because it was obvious they were never going to make me
  Princess Anne, no matter how well I did the job. It was a question
  of who you were, rather than how well you did, you know, and I hate
  that.

  and so he did. He put it in the cupboard under the stairs and it

Assistant: Eight?
Hugh: Eight. Four of them featherlite, three of them ribbed, [half
  sotto voce] the new single by Jason Donovan, [loud again] and one
  multi-coloured pack of Fiestas.
Assistant: Jason Donovan?
Hugh: That's right. Can you make sure they're all sensitol
  lubricated?

Stephen: Right. Well, I'd like to see her then please.
Hugh: I'm afraid she's no longer with us.
Stephen: Oh? Indeed? I can hardly say I'm surprised. Where can I get
  in touch with her?

John: Damn it four times around the car park and back in for another
  damn it!

John: But damn it every which way but one, Peter!

Peter: John, do something for me. Come over here to the window, take
  a look.
John: What is this, some kind of game?
Peter: No game, John! Tell me what you see!
John: [peeks through the blinds out the window] I see a car park.
Peter: Well that's funny, John. Because you know, the last time you
  looked out of that window, you saw... an idea. Don't you remember?
John: Yes, I remember thinking that would be a good place to put a
  car park.

Peter: No, don't you "dammit I-" me! We got *that* close, and you're
  just going to *lie* down, and *walk* away?

John: Damn, double damn, and an extra pint of damn for the weekend!

Stephen: I think animal testing is a terrible idea. They get all
  nervous and give silly answers.


# "A Bit of Fry and Laurie" (1987) {Pilot (#1.0)}
Hugh: But did you enjoy their criticism?
Stephen: Oh, I loved it. I wanted to go to bed with it and kiss it in
  many soft, private, little places.

Stephen: I think it was Donald Mainstock, the great amateur squash
  player, who pointed out how lovely I was. Until that time, I think
  it was safe to say that I had never really been aware of my own
  timeless brand of loveliness. But his words smote me because, of
  course you see, I am lovely in a fluffy moist kind of a way and who
  would have it otherwise? I walk, let's be splendid about this, in a
  lightly accented cloud of gorgeousness that isn't far short of
  being, quite simply, terrific. The secret of smooth almost shiny
  loveliness of the order of which we're discussing in this simple,
  frank, creamy soft way doesn't reside in oils, unguents, balms,
  ointments, creams, astringents, milks, moisturisers, liniments,
  lubricants, embrocations or balsams, to be rather divine for just
  one noble moment. It resides, and I mean this in a pink, slightly
  special way, in one's attitude of mind. To be gorgeous and high and
  true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely, all you
  have to do is believe that one is gorgeous and high and true and
  fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely. And I believe it
  of myself, tremulously at first, and then with mounting heat and
  passion because, stopping off for a second to be super again, I'm
  so often told it. That's the secret really.

Stephen: Landlord, I'll have two foaming pints of your most
  homosexual beer, thank you.
Hugh: Oh, and a packet of arse bandits as well.

Hugh: Oh, well, it's because I'm deaf, sir, that my sense of vision
  is naturally enhanced. Blind people are known to have very keen
  hearing. So they sort of cancel each other out, sir.
Stephen: You mean you can see and hear perfectly?
Hugh: Yes, because I'm blind and deaf.

Hugh: You mean we've been sleeping together all this time, behind my
  back?

Hugh: "My word, Jane," I used to say to my wife, "the garden's
  looking very homosexual this morning."
Stephen: Quite right. Quite right. Lovely word.


# "A Bit of a Do" (1989)
Rita Simcock: How would you like it if you were described as an
  ex-company-director, five foot nine, with greying black hair,
  bloodshot eyes, vital statistics 29-36-5-31!
Ted Simcock: What's the five?
Rita Simcock: What do you think?
Ted Simcock: Rita! I mean... that's extremely personal and very
  insulting... and inaccurate. I mean... really!

Liz Rodenhurst: I must say, Rita, it wasn't exactly tactful to come
  tonight.
Rita Simcock: That's why I came.
Liz Rodenhurst: How nasty.
Rita Simcock: I'd hardly describe it as nice to steal my husband and
  have his baby.
Liz Rodenhurst: I wouldn't exactly describe taking things that turn
  up on one's doorstep as "stealing."
Rita Simcock: I feel that events have forced us to become enemies.
  What a pity we couldn't have got to know each other under happier
  circumstances. Then we could have become enemies of our own free
  will.

Jenny Simcock: They won't let Paul in without a tie.
Laurence Rodenhurst: I've got a Dental Association tie in my car - if
  he has no rooted objection to maroon.
Jenny Simcock: The nastier the better. He won't care if it's got four
  crossed molars on a ruptured abscess.

Laurence Rodenhurst: Paul, sometimes a woman needs to be alone.
Paul Simcock: Not Jenny. Our marriage is a "totality of shared
  experience".
Laurence Rodenhurst: [mutters] Berk!

Jenny Simcock: Don't you start to give me moral lectures, Simon. Are
  you two so pure yourselves?
Simon and Lucinda: [smugly] Yes.
Elvis: [reprovingly] Simon?
Lucinda: Well, apart from Simon's isolated lapse - which he's told me
  all about and I've forgiven.
Jenny Simcock: And no lapses at all in your past, Lucinda?
Lucinda: Unfashionably for this day and age, no. In eighty-seven
  days' time, Simon will be the first person in the world to know my
  body.
Simon: We *were* planning to invite you both.
Elvis: I'll watch with interest. I may even be able to give you a tip
  or two!

[recurring line]
Alec the Barman: Can do. No problem. Tickety-boo.

Simon: [sneering] How's our philosophy graduate enjoying life among
  the frozen poultry?
Elvis: If you weren't my brother's wife's brother, I'd make my highly
  desirable manual extremity extremely convenient for your spatious
  breathing and blowing organ.
Simon: Pardon?
Elvis: I'd punch you on the nose. I was using estate agent-ese.

Jenny Simcock: Hello, Mum. Hello, Neville.
Liz Rodenhurst: Hello.
Jenny Simcock: I've something to... Earlier, Mum, you said you hoped
  I'd find somebody soon.
Liz Rodenhurst: Yes.
Jenny Simcock: Well I have.
Neville Badger: That *was* soon!
Jenny Simcock: Yes. You said you hoped he'd be nice. He *is* nice.
Liz Rodenhurst: That's nice.
Jenny Simcock: [sheepishly] I'm afraid he may disappoint your hopes
  pretty considerably in one particular respect. I'm afraid he fails
  - utterly and totally fails - the criterion of... oh Lord!.. of not
  being a Simcock.
[stunned silence]
Liz Rodenhurst: [shrieks] Elvis?

Elvis: It's our Paul - he's been arrested!
Ted Simcock: Arrested? What for?
Elvis: There's been a big demonstration. He threw an egg at the Prime
  Minister.
Rita Simcock: Did it hit?
Jenny Simcock: Was it free range?
Neville Badger: Was it infected with salmonella?

[Elvis is working as wine waiter]
Simon: Waiter!
Elvis: Yes, sir.
Simon: Elvis?
Elvis: Simon?
Simon: Good Lord. Ah, this is my sister's husband's brother. Sorry,
  must be a bit embarrassing for you.
Elvis: No, not really. Though you might try something a little more
  polite that yelling "Waiter!".
Simon: What's rude about that?
Elvis: Well, how you you like it if I pop into your office and yell
  "Estate agent!"?
Simon: That's different.
Elvis: Yeah - you're a member of a profession and I'm only a waiter.
Simon: I think you've rather forgotten your position, Elvis.
Elvis: I *was* speaking as your sister's husband's brother. Speaking
  as a waiter...
Elvis: [obsequiously] What can I get you, sir?

[Elvis is working as a wine waiter and has just delivered drinks to
  Simon and his friends]
Simon: So, Elvis, are you finding your *three years* as a philosophy
  graduate helpful in your job?
Elvis: Incredibly.
Simon: Oh, good, good. You don't feel that the taxpayers' money has
  been poured down the drain, then?
Elvis: Money, money, money! I hear the heart of an estate agent
  beating like a till. In my brief spell as a waiter, Simon, I have
  learned the answer to a question that has exercised philosophers
  down the ages.
Simon: What question?
Elvis: Is the external world real or is it just a figment of the
  imagination? Do you exist outside my mind? I now know that you do.
Simon: How?
Elvis: [snarls] Because I wouldn't have wasted my time inventing
  anyone as *futile* as you!
Simon: [snarls] Ditto... with knobs on!
Elvis: Precisely. Case proven.
[pause]
Elvis: [obsequiously] That'll be £9.46, sir. Call it £10 for cash.

Lucinda: Simon wants to know if you can get the ring road plan
  scrapped, Rita.
Rita Simcock: Tell him, no, I can't get it scrapped.
Lucinda: No, she can't get it scrapped.
Simon: Damn!
Lucinda: Damn!
Ted Simcock: Thank you, Simon.
Simon: What on earth for?
Ted Simcock: Because every time I meet you, I get to thinking my two
  aren't such berks after all.


# "A Cook's Tour" (2002)
Anthony Bourdain: As a cook, tastes and smells are my memories, and
  I'm in search of some new ones. So I'm leaving New York and hoping
  to have a few epiphanies around the world. I'm looking for extremes
  of emotion and experience. I'll try anything. I'll risk everything.
  I have nothing to lose.


# "A Dance to the Music of Time" (1997) {The Twenties (#1.1)}
JC Quiggin: I thought people came to University to study, not to

Himself - Dad's Garage Improviser: I'm ready to reach for the
  sky...and then put it back down.


# "A Different World" (1987)
[the class has decided to leave a time capsule to be remembered by]
African Student: Excuse me, please, but what is a time capsule?
Kim Reese: A time capsule is when people bury something that's
  important to them and then dig them up later.
Ron Johnson: Like dogs with bones. [pause] Or women with grudges.

Kim Reese: [crying after Claire Huxstable asks about her career
  goals] Everybody expects me to be good I'm not good. What if I mess
  up on a patient? I can't even chop zuchini.

[repeated Line]
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Relax, relate, release.

[Whitley's bridesmaids scream as they enter her bedroom on her
  wedding day morning]
Marion Gilbert: Ladies, ladies please. Your loud screaming will give
  me a headache which will cause me to frown and lead me to an early
  face lift.

[Ron and Dwayne are dressed as women to hide from cocaine dealers
  that are chasing them]
Ron Johnson: You look ridiculous.
Dwayne Cleophus Wayne: Well, nobody's gonna mistake you for Miss
  America.
Ron Johnson: I'm talking about you lipstick it clashes with your
  blouse.

[after returning from the Island Police station dressed as women
  because they're hiding from drug dealers]
Ron Johnson: You got my butt pinched by some dock worker.
Dwayne Cleophus Wayne: A butt pinch hurts a lot less then a bullet
  wound.
Ron Johnson: [snatching off his wig and slamming it angryly on the
  couch] At least a bullet is something you can take like a man.

Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: [after noticing Freddie's face was
  painted] Sorry Homey, Whitley don't play that!

Julian Day: [Whitley and Julian are breaking up in an Italian
  restaurant] Waiter, check please.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Yes, la cuenta and *fast*!
Julian Day: It's "il conto".
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Oh, cuenta, conto, Kunta Kinte, just
  get the ding-dang check!

Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: [after sleeping with Dwayne the night
  before] Last night didn't mean anything. As far as Dwayne is
  concerned, that ship has sailed and sunk.
Kim Reese: Not if you can't tell Bryon about it.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Why? We're not even an official couple
  yet.
Kim Reese: Whitley, if you can't tell him, maybe last night meant
  more than you think.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Such pearls of wisdom from one who
  pines over that swine Ron Johnson.
Kim Reese: Well, at least I've got it numbered down to one.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: But has he?

Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: [after being sexually harassed by her
  employee] It's so nice to know women have a place in business. Too
  bad it's horizontal.

Winifred 'Freddie' Brooks: Ron, you are looking at a woman on a
  mission.
Ron Johnson: You're looking at a man on a mission. I have to go talk
  to Kim.
Winifred 'Freddie' Brooks: Um, wait. I want us to get past our petty
  differences. There is something that I would like to share with
  you, brother, and it's from right here, the ol' ticker. My heart.
Ron Johnson: Oh. Okay.
Winifred 'Freddie' Brooks: I don't like you, Ron. I never have.
  You're a greasy worm with the charm of a cockroach. Whoo! [Starts
  moving around and shaking] Ah, giving birth, giving birth! [Places
  her palms on her forehead] Oh, man! Telling the truth is so freeing
  and it's so forgiving because I forgive myself for not telling you
  this years ago.

Gina Devereaux: It's not what you think, Whitley. Dion is the
  sweetest, most romantic guy I've ever gone out with.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: So I've heard. He's just nervous about
  the concert.
Gina Devereaux: Well, you know how I am - I'm so self-centered and
  I'm always running off at the mouth, and you know how I flirt.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: There's no excuse for what he did to
  you, Gina. You're much smarter than this.
Gina Devereaux: But he loves me... and I don't want to break up with
  him. [Sniffs] I just want him to stop.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Throwing jabs? You're making a big
  mistake, Gina, if you think you can change that boy.
Gina Devereaux: Well, I mean, I can try, can't I? Isn't love about
  sacrifices? I mean, maybe I am being stupid, but I don't even care
  anymore.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: I think you do, Gina. I think you do
  care. I think you're embarrassed about that black eye. Believe me,
  I know about sacrifices. But I'd rather sacrifice my relationship
  than my body... or my spirit.
Gina Devereaux: Well... that's easy for you to say. You always got
  somebody.
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: That's right. And her name is Whitley.
  Gina, do you really think you need a man that doesn't respect you?
  [Removes Gina's glasses and holds her chin upwards, so that she is
  facing Whitley directly]
Gina Devereaux: [as tears stream down her face] I better not miss his
  call. [Rushes out of the room]

Shazza Zulu: Look, if we as Hillman men don't treat our women right,
  they'll go to somebody white. Kim Reese did!
Kim Reese: You pseudo-intellectual male with a pseudo-African name
  spouting pseudo-philosophy about a whole bunch of nothing! In fact,
  the only thing about you that's real are your green eyes... MY
  BRUTHA!


# "A Different World" (1987) {Honeymoon in L.A.: Part 1 (#6.1)}
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: [the Rodney King verdict is aired on a
  television in a department store. Four white cops are acquitted of
  beating a unarmed Black man. Several worried people are glued to
  the set. There is a feeling of outrage among the small throng] How
  could they acquit them? I mean, it was on tape. Hard evidence.
Ianta: Evidence?
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Solid!
Ianta: Girl, please. They can beat us, kill us, do whatever they
  wanna do - and get off - just like they always have.
Ianta: [scoffs]
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: We still have the Constitution to
  protect us.
Ianta: When that piece of paper was written, African people in this
  country were slaves - ALL of us. We sisters were considered nothing
  but bed warmers!
Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: But we have our rights now. I mean,
  they-they're not gonna deny me. I'm an African American.
Ianta: Here, Ms. Lambchop. Stop worrying about integrating and being
  accepted, and start thinking about building - for yourself, for our
  people - so that we can provide a *future* for our children.
[thunderous applause is heard on soundtrack]

Ianta: No, actually, the name is Ianta, but you can call me dark and
  lovely.

Whitley Marion Gilbert Wayne: Oh, don't let me turn street on you!

  call. [rushes out of the room]

Vernon Gaines: How about a refill?
Gina Devereaux: No thanks, Mr. Gaines
Vernon Gaines: Now, I know it's not my place, but it's old folks
  nature to butt in.
Gina Devereaux: Mr. Gaines, I've been getting a little too much of
  that lately.
Vernon Gaines: Well, I'll make it quick then. Tell you a story about
  my cousin Ida Mae. We grew up together. Ida Mae was always saying
  "I don't believe my husband loves me unless he hits me once a
  week." Well, one day her husband LOVED her to death. And we buried
  her last year.


# "A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery" (1987) {Gaudy Night: Episode One (#1.8)}
[Harriet calls Peter to talk at a restaurant with a dance hall]
Lord Peter Wimsey: Tell me, what's the matter?
Harriet Vane: I'm not sure I should.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Tell me or tango.
Harriet Vane: You know I can't tango!
Lord Peter Wimsey: You've no choice then, have you?

Miss Burrows: Excuse my saying so, Miss Vane, but given your own
  terrible experience, I wonder that you should still decide to write
  the sort of books you do.
Harriet Vane: You're saying that anyone with proper feelings would
  rather scrub floors for a living? Well, I should scrub floors very
  badly, and I write mysteries rather well.

Lord Peter Wimsey: This bowtie is a mess.
Bunter: Yes, too perfect. Quite like a made-up affair.
[Wimsey pulls off the tie and begins to re-tie it]
Bunter: Ah.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Bunter, what does "ah" mean?
Bunter: I have observed, my lord, that on the few occasions when our
  sangfroid slips, it means we have a rendezvous with Miss Vane.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Bunter, you have a wonderful gift for impudence.
Bunter: Thank you, my lord.
[Wimsey finishes re-tying]
Lord Peter Wimsey: Bunter, how's that?
Bunter: Perfect. That is to say, slightly flawed. The mark of a true
  gentleman.


# "A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery" (1987) {Gaudy Night: Episode Two (#1.9)}
[Wimsey and Bunter present their papers to the German border
  policeman]
Border policeman: Ah! An Englischer aristokrat.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Put like that, it sounds like an insult.
Border policeman: In Germany, it is the people who rule.
Lord Peter Wimsey: I see from the paper that there will be elections
  soon?
Border policeman: Ja, it is likely.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Chancellor Bruning's emergency powers will be
  short-lived?
Border policeman: You are interested in our domestic politics?
Lord Peter Wimsey: If no man is an island, then assuredly no country
  can be.
Border policeman: Except yours, Lord Wimsey.


# "A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery" (1987) {Have His Carcase: Episode Four (#1.7)}
Lord Peter Wimsey: [after realizing a new lead] Oh, frabjous day!
  Miss Vane, will you marry me? Or, failing that, will you accompany
  me to Darley's garage?
Harriet Vane: I will.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Let us be gone.
[they get up and start to head out, but Peter stops]
Lord Peter Wimsey: Uh...
Harriet Vane: The latter.


# "A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery" (1987) {Have His Carcase: Episode One (#1.4)}
Lord Peter Wimsey: May I come into your parlor?
Harriet Vane: Peter! What on earth are you doing here?
Lord Peter Wimsey: [holds up newspaper] "Famous Mystery Author Finds
  Body on Beach" So, here I am, like a bird that hears the call of
  its mate.
Harriet Vane: I didn't call you...
Lord Peter Wimsey: I meant the body. But talking of mates, will you
  marry me?
Harriet Vane: Certainly not.

Harriet Vane: I'm sorry, I know I'm being horribly ungrateful...
Lord Peter Wimsey: Oh, *hell*! Am I never to hear the end of that
  hateful adjective? I keep telling you, I don't want gratitude! I
  don't want kindness, I don't want sentimentality! I just want
  common honesty.
Harriet Vane: But that's all I ever wanted! I don't think it's to be
  had.
[silence]
Lord Peter Wimsey: Harriet, I do understand. I know you don't ever
  want to have to depend on another person for your happiness ever
  again.
Harriet Vane: That's true. That's the truest thing you've ever said.

Bunter: What the eye don't see the heart can't grieve for.


# "A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery" (1987) {Have His Carcase: Episode Three (#1.6)}
Harriet Vane: I'm sorry, I know I'm being horribly ungrateful...

[Peter demonstrates a throat-cutting on Bunter, then sees Harriet's
  shock]
Lord Peter Wimsey: I'm so sorry.
Harriet Vane: No, no, it's all right.
Lord Peter Wimsey: No, no, I'm an ass. And in a moment I shall get
  down on my knees and apologize, and probably propose to you as
  well.
Harriet Vane: Oh, Peter! What an idiot you are!
Lord Peter Wimsey: Aren't I, though?

Salcombe Hardy: You wouldn't be here for the suicide of a foreign
  gigolo. There's something more to it than that... unless it's just
  the girl? Oh, for God's sake, Wimsey, say it isn't the girl! You
  wouldn't play a joke like that on a hard-working journalist. Look,
  how about you give me a story about you and Harriet Vane? "Romantic
  Engagement of Peer's Son and Crime Novelist!"
Lord Peter Wimsey: Pull yourself together, Sally, and keep your inky
  paws off my private affairs.


# "A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery" (1987) {Strong Poison: Episode One (#1.1)}
[Thinking about Harriet Vane]
Lord Peter Wimsey: She has a sense of humor... and brains... life
  wouldn't be dull. One would wake up, and there would be a whole day
  full of jolly things to do. And then we would come home and go to
  bed... and that would be jolly too.

Harriet Vane: Have I got this right? You are proposing marriage to
  me?
Lord Peter Wimsey: I don't positively repel you or anything like
  that, do I?

[Peter is visiting Harriet in prison, meeting her for the first time]
Lord Peter Wimsey: But, um, you're not opposed to matrimony on
  principle? I mean if offered on terms not already compromised, and
  by the right person, naturally.
Harriet Vane: Oh, no.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Oh, that's good.
Harriet Vane: Might I ask why?
Lord Peter Wimsey: Makes it easier for me, you see.
Harriet Vane: [after a pause] Have I got this right? You are
  proposing marriage to me?
Lord Peter Wimsey: Absolutely right.
Harriet Vane: [laughing] Do you do this all the time, Lord Peter?
Lord Peter Wimsey: Only when I'm serious.
Harriet Vane: And you're serious now?
Lord Peter Wimsey: Oh, I know I've got a silly face, but I can't help
  that. And I am. Serious, I mean.

Lord Peter Wimsey: I-I-I'm not, um, trying to blackmail you into
  matrimony. I mean, I would investigate this case for the fun of the
  thing.
Harriet Vane: That's very good of you.
Lord Peter Wimsey: No, no, no, not at all, it's my hobby. I mean
  investigating things, not proposing to people.

Harriet Vane: Being a writer of detective fiction, I have naturally
  studied your career with interest.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Well, that's good, because then you'll understand
  that I'm not such an ass as I'm appearing at present.

Chief Inspector Charles Parker: [writing a note] "Boyes - query
  arsenic." Anything else?
Lord Peter Wimsey: Yes. Find out if Boyes visited any pub, in the
  neighbourhood of Doughty Street between 9:50 and 10:10 on the night
  of January 20th, if he met anybody, and what he took to drink.
Chief Inspector Charles Parker: [keeps writing] "Boyes - query pub."
Lord Peter Wimsey: And thirdly, find out if any bottle or paper that
  might have contained arsenic was picked up in that district.
Chief Inspector Charles Parker: Oh, is that all? Well, perhaps you'd
  also like me to trace the bus ticket dropped by Mrs. Brown outside
  Selfridge's in the last Christmas rush?

Lord Peter Wimsey: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go see a man
  about a dog - or I should say, a parson about his son.


# "A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery" (1987) {Strong Poison: Episode Two (#1.2)}
Harriet Vane: You are bearing in mind, aren't you, that I've had a
  lover?
Lord Peter Wimsey: Oh, yes, so've I. Several, in fact. It's the sort
  of thing that could happen to anyone. I can produce quite good
  testimonials. I'm told I make love rather nicely. Though I am at a
  bit of a disadvantage at the moment. One can't be too convincing at
  the other end of the table with a bloke looking in the window.
Harriet Vane: I'll take your word for it.

Harriet Vane: If anybody does marry you, Peter, it will be for the
  pleasure of hearing you talk piffle.

Harriet Vane: Peter, people have been wrongly condemned before now.
Lord Peter Wimsey: Only because I wasn't there.
Harriet Vane: Oh, I never thought of that.

Bill Rumm: We all are like sheep who have gone astray, and well I may
  say so, for I was a dark and wicked sinner myself, until this here
  gentleman laid his hand upon me as I was a-bustin' of his safe, and
  became God's instrument for turning me away from the path that
  leadeth to destruction.

Lord Peter Wimsey: I don't suppose you have the faintest idea how to
  pick a lock, Miss Murchison?
Miss Murchison: I'm afraid not - no idea whatsoever!
Lord Peter Wimsey: I sometimes wonder what we went to school for.


# "A Family at War" (1970) {...Yielding Place to New (#3.20)}

Rufus Fletcher: Adam's playing lord of the manor, he just sacked the

Mary Gage: Well I don't think he should have let him go! You have to
  keep this house up, cherish it for your great-uncle's sake.
Rufus Fletcher: Oh yes, please! I would like to become a member of
  the Grown-Ups Club, please rush me a subscription form and a
  prospectus for a musty afterlife.

Rufus Fletcher: Don't carry that guilty look around all the time. In
  South America you would have been incarcerated for that already.


# "A Fine Romance" (1981)
Harry: [to Mike and Laura] I like you two. You're odd.

Laura Dalton: [Mike stares at Laura's pajamas] I have a nightie, but
  it's in the wash.
Mike Selway: No, no, they're fine. I think they're very, uh, very
  dinky.
Laura Dalton: Dinky?
Mike Selway: It's not my day for words, is it?
Laura Dalton: Oh, Mike, it doesn't matter.
Mike Selway: Well it does, because just for once I'd like to say
  something that was right.
Laura Dalton: Why?
Mike Selway: Because you'd like me to.
Laura Dalton: Look, if you can get by without the sheer black
  nightie, I can get by without the words. [They kiss] Nobody got
  hurt.
Mike Selway: [Laughing nervously] No.

Mike Selway: You've been crying.
Laura Dalton: No, I have not.
Mike Selway: What's that water running down your face?
Laura Dalton: I'm leaking.

Helen Barker: [about Mike] He does wine-and-dine you sometimes,
  doesn't he?
Laura Dalton: Oh, yes. Well, not exactly wine-and-dine me as
  lager-and-hamburger me.

Mike Selway: You look younger since you've been sick.
Laura Dalton: Perhaps that's the answer - vomit your wrinkles away.

[Laura is high on nitrous oxide from the dentist]
Laura Dalton: Do you know where I'd like to go? Torquay.
Mike Selway: No, not tonight.
Laura Dalton: I knew a little dog in Torquay. He could hear perfectly
  well with his one ear.

# "A Fine Romance" (1981) {First Meeting (#1.1)}
Mike Selway: Let's, uh, let's talk about you. Helen said you were a
  linguist.
Laura Dalton: Yes, I translate things. It's all pretty boring.
Mike Selway: Oh, no, I'm sure it's not. What are you translating at
  the moment?
Laura Dalton: A German textbook on urinary infections.

Helen Barker: You know I've always envied your intelligence. Dad used
  to say, "Helen, you've got the beauty but your sister's got the
  brains."
Laura Dalton: How *dare* you stand there in your Janet Reger
  underwear and tell me I'm cleverer than you are?
Helen Barker: Well, you are!
Laura Dalton: Well, I don't want to be cleverer than you are! I want
  to stand there in Janet Reger underwear!

Helen Barker: Laura, do you practice conversation-killers like that?
Laura Dalton: I don't have any small talk. I don't even have any
  medium talk. Just let me go round offering the sausages and I won't
  ever refer to them again as dead pigs.


# "A Fine Romance" (1981) {The Restaurant (#1.3)}
Mike Selway: You're not Women's Lib, are you?
Laura Dalton: No! Well, not unless it suits me.

Mike Selway: It's a knack, making something out of nothing, and I
  haven't got it.
Laura Dalton: You weren't looking for a contradiction, were you?


# "A Fine Romance" (1981) {Unlucky in Love (#1.4)}
Laura Dalton: I don't like obscene telephone calls, so I'm going to
  hang up now, because if I go on any longer this is going to become
  one.

Saleslady: I definitely think Madam would turn heads.
Laura Dalton: People asphyxiating usually do. It's no good, I've got
  to get out of it. And bring your crowbar.

Christina Holt: Anna! Anna, it's me Christina.
Dr. Michael Holt: So loud.
Christina Holt: I miss you!
Dr. Michael Holt: Really? Happy Thanksgiving.

Dr. Zeke Barnes: Kate thinks he's allergic to Thanksgiving.
Christina Holt: Probably cause of the last one we spent together as a
  family.
Dr. Zeke Barnes: That bad, huh?
Christina Holt: Pretty brutal actually.

Christina Holt: This is a cosmic gift Michael!


# "A Haunting" (2005)
[introduction]
Narrator: In this world, there is real evil in the darkest shadows
  and in the most ordinary places. These are the true stories of the
  innocent and the unimaginable. Between the world we see and the
  things we fear, there are doors. When they are opened, nightmares
  become reality.


# "A Haunting" (2005) {Hell House (#1.3)}
[opening narration]
Narrator: For the Beckwith family, a new home means new beginnings
  until something from the past returns to haunt them. The family
  calls in a team of renowned psychic investigators to make contact
  with restless spirits and fight the wrath of an unholy demon.

Bonnie Beckwith: I'm not the type of person to give up my home to a
  dead person.

[closing narration]
Narrator: Today the Beckwiths have learned how to deal with their
  ghostly co-inhabitants.

[last lines]
Bonnie Beckwith: I came into this house pretty much an atheist. And
  now I've seen the powers of God, I've seen the powers of the devil,
  right before my very eyes. And it's made me a stronger person.


# "A Haunting" (2005) {The Haunting of Summerwind (#1.2)}
[opening narration]
Narrator: When the Hinshaw family moves into Summerwind, the house
  speaks to them in whispers. In time, whispers become screams and
  buried secrets lead to possession. The family must calm restless
  spirits before the house consumes them all.

[first lines]
Ginger Hinshaw: I fell in love with the house immediately. Had to
  have it. Absolutely wanted that house in the worst way. Felt sorry
  for the house. Really, really sorry.

[closing narration]
Narrator: The truth will forever remain a mystery, but what happened
  to this family will haunt them until the day they die.

[last lines]
April: When it did burn down, it was cleansing. I could feel a
  relief, and I felt the evil was gone. I would never go back, burned
  or not burned. I will never go back.


# "A Kind of Magic" (1990)
[Ringo and Linda are about to perform a sword trick on Wayne]
Wayne: Has anyone done this trick before?
Ringo: Er, King Henry the Eighth tried it on a couple of his wives!

[Ringo is about to demonstrate his ability at ESP]
Wayne: [spotting the eye holes in Ringo's blindfold] Oi!
Ringo: I've been meaning to tell you about the moths in this hat!
  Sorry about that.

Ringo: I remember the last time we did this - it was the end of the
  series and nobody told me. I spent 8 weeks in my hat thinking 'this
  audience is quiet!' I wasn't too worried, though, cause you've
  waited 8 weeks for a laugh before now!
Wayne: Oi!

[Wayne is holding a man's credit card]
Wayne: What am I holding, Ringo?
Ringo: I'd rather not say!
Wayne: Come on, Ringo, It's your flexible friend!
Ringo: That's why I'd rather not say!

Wayne: Is this your card?
Credit Card Owner: Yes.
Wayne: Thank you.
[Goes to pocket the card]
Ringo: I wouldn't put that in there, Wayne, it expired last month!
Wayne: [looking at the card] So it did!
[Wayne hands the card back]

[Wayne removes the blindfold from Ringo]
Ringo: Thanks, mate. By the way, Wayne - you wouldn't *really* have
  hit me with that hammer, would you?
[Ringo ducks into the hat as Wayne grabs the hammer]

Coach Jimmy Dugan: No crying! What's Jimmy Dugan's most important
  rule?
Doris Murphy: Never vomit on your shoes.
Coach Jimmy Dugan: *Baseball* rules!

Betty Horn: You wanna leave? You're stinking up the place.
Ernie Capadino: I'll have you know this is a 25 cent cigar.
Betty Horn: Who said anything about a cigar?
Ernie Capadino: Apparently learning to wear shoes has made them
  irritable.

Mae Mordabito: Marla, did you just fall off a melon truck?
Marla Hooch: No, not *just*.


# "A Little Princess" (1986)
Miss Minchin: Aren't you going to thank me?
Sara Crewe: Thank you?
Miss Minchin: For my kindness in giving you a home!
Sara Crewe: No, Miss Minchin, you are not kind. And this is not a
  home.

Miss Minchin: Rebecca, you forget yourself! It is not your place to
  smile at my young ladies!

Sara Crewe: Please Miss Minchin, may Becky stay?
Miss Minchin: Why, Sara dear?
Sara Crewe: Because I know she'd enjoy it. After all, she's a young
  girl, too.
Miss Minchin: She most certainly is not, she's a scullery maid!

Miss Minchin: Beg Miss Lavina's pardon.
Sara Crewe: No I won't beg her pardon because it was her fault!
Miss Minchin: Beg her pardon!
[Sara bites her lip]
Miss Minchin: Don't laugh at me you insolent child!
[slaps Sara]
Miss Amelia: Mirah!
Sara Crewe: I wasn't laughing, I was thinking.
Miss Minchin: What?
Sara Crewe: I was thinking it would be a surpise if I turned out to
  be a princess after all. Wouldn't it?

Cook: Didn't they teach you the Bible in India? "To them that hath
  not shall be taken away." *You* hath not the parsley, therefore I'm
  taking away your supper.

Cook: Books! What does a skivvy want with books? They don't teach you
  how to scrub floors do they?

Miss Minchin: I admit I never *liked* the girl.
Miss Amelia: Because she could see through you, that's why! She knew
  you for what you are, a pity-less, hard-hearted woman who cares for
  nothing but money!
Miss Minchin: How dare you Amelia! Without my care for *money* as you
  put it, you would still be a frumpish nursemaid in...
Miss Amelia: I would rather be a *frumpish nursemaid* than accept
  your values a moment longer!

# "A Man Called Shenandoah" (1965) {Survival (#1.2)}
Shenandoah: Lady, your looking at a man without a name. I don't even
  have a memory.


# "A Man Called Shenandoah" (1965) {The Fort (#1.3)}
Shenandoah: [on Amnesia] It's like living in murky, churned up water.
  And yet sometimes I feel like I'm going to recognize a place, a
  thing... maybe a word or a phrase. And sometimes a face seems so
  familiar I... I feel like I'm right on the edge of remembering and
  then suddenly something stirs the water up again. It's like being
  blinded by that antiseptic stuff and never seeing anything clearer
  than a fuzzy shape. It's like going up a dark stairway and finding
  the last step isn't there.


# "A Man Called Shenandoah" (1965) {The Onslaught (#1.1)}
Dr. Maghee: We may not know who you are, but we do know you have a
  good set of lungs.

Shenandoah: He knew me. Why did he want to kill me?

Shenandoah: You can't build much of a future without knowing about
  the past.

Dr. Maghee: Write Shenandoah... S H E N A N D O A H.
Shenandoah: What kind of name is that?
Dr. Maghee: The Indians gave that name to one of the most beautiful
  spots on earth. It means 'Lord of Silence.'


# "A Many Splintered Thing" (2000)
Elly Rawsthorne: Russel Boyd, do you swear to love me, adore me and

Stan Hooper: I just want to live a normal life.
Gary: Well you came to the wrong place.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001)
Archie: Nero Wolfe gets what Nero Wolfe wants, or he throws a tantrum
  and I get fired.

Nero Wolfe: May I sit down?
All: NO!
Nero Wolfe: I must overrule you.

[Wolfe fakes a nervous breakdown for Dr. Vollmer]
Nero Wolfe: Do you want to pay two dollars a pound for butter? Fifty
  cents for shoestrings? A dollar for a bottle of beer? Hmph. Well?
  Confound it, answer me!
Archie: I don't know if it's the willies or what, but as you can see
  -
Nero Wolfe: Just because I ask you to lend me five dollars until the
  beginning of the next war, does not mean that I'm a frugal person.
Dr. Vollmer: Who wrote this script for him?
Archie: It's been like this ever since I brought him home.
Dr. Vollmer: He's been out of the house?
Nero Wolfe: Archie tells me that you're masquerading as a doctor.
  Bah! They'll take your clothes off too! Oh, yes, they'll examine
  every inch of your skin, and they'll find the mark. The one that
  entitles you to a discount.

[Wolfe pretends to have lost his mind]
Nero Wolfe: Aren't you a physician? Don't you know a nervous
  breakdown when you see one?
Dr. Vollmer: Yes. Yes, I do.
Nero Wolfe: Well, then, what's the matter with it?
Dr. Vollmer: It doesn't seem, um, typical.
Nero Wolfe: That's a faulty observation! That's a defect in your
  training! Specifically, it's a persecution complex, you idiot!
Dr. Vollmer: And who's been doing the persecuting?

[Feigning a nervous breakdown]
Nero Wolfe: You're not going to cut me! They're coming in hordes! I
  see them on chariots with spiked wheels, waving insolent banners of
  inflation! Oh! Archie! They're pelting me with worthless coins!

[repeated line]
Archie: Nuts!

[repeated line]
Nero Wolfe: Pfui!


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Before I Die (#2.11)}
Archie Goodwin: That afternoon I had all of Nero wolfe that I could
  stand. I wasn't blaming him. We were two months into the great meat
  shortage. The boys overseas needed the rations, and there was
  nothing left for the loyal homefront. But to Nero Wolfe a meal
  without meat is an insult.

Archie 2: [as Archie opens the door] Your name's Goodwin.
Archie Goodwin: Thanks. How much do I weigh?

Inspector Cramer: How are you?
Nero Wolfe: I am the way I always am before lunch - hungry!

Archie Goodwin: [to Dazy] Listen, uh, whatever it is you wanted,
  Wolfe wants no part of it. Now, I know that I'm not laughing it
  off. People that laugh things off with you end up at funerals
  playing the lead.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Champagne for One: Part 1 (#1.2)}
Archie: I never implied that I had the slightest notion who did it,
  how or why. I'm only saying Faith Usher put nothing whatsoever in
  her glass of champagne.
Inspector Cramer: So you won't discuss it, hmm?
Archie: I won't? [looks around, puzzled]
Archie: What are we doing?
Inspector Cramer: [looks cranky]

Archie: As a dancing partner, Rose was not a bargain. She was
  equipped for it physically, but she danced cheerfully. You can't
  dance cheerfully. Dancing's too important.

Nero Wolfe: Nothing is as pitiable as a man afraid of a woman. Is he
  guiless?

Archie: Anybody who takes Wolfe down a peg renders a service to
  nature.

Austin 'Dinky' Byne: To tell the truth, I'm in a bit of a mess
  myself, or I will be if you like to see me squirm.
Archie: Depends on what kind of squirmer you are.

Archie: She was a good dancer, but she was also a very good drinker.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Christmas Party (#1.9)}
Margot Dickey: [cattily interrupting Lily and Archie dancing]
  Archie's such a good dancer. Are you his Monday night partner?
Lily Rowan: Ah, yes.
Margot Dickey: I'm Wednesdays.
Lily Rowan: Monday nights - regular as pot roast in a diner.

Nero Wolfe: Christmas - an excuse for wretched excess aptly
  symbolized by an elephantine elf who delivers gifts to the whole
  world in one night.

Archie Goodwin: I'd rather have to eat all the snow that had fallen
  since noon than explain the wedding license to Stebbins and Cramer.

Archie Goodwin: I got Margot a license to marry, not a license to
  kill.

Kurt Bottweil: I always have a Pernot after lunch. It's my secret
  public vice.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Cop Killer (#2.15)}
Carl Vardas: You're not a serious person.
Archie Goodwin: And proud of it!

Archie Goodwin: [about Janet] Well, I don't have to ask if you heard
  it all. If you shoot her, send her brain to Johns Hopkins.

Sergeant Purley Stebbins: [referring to Janet] You know, I ain't sold
  she's as unfurnished in her head as she lets on.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Death of a Doxy: Part 1 (#2.1)}
Nero Wolfe: Archie, don't try to think. You'll injure yourself.

Mrs. Ballou: I love wolfhounds. They love me.
Archie Goodwin: [humoring her] Yes.
Mrs. Ballou: When I'm in the country, my eight favorites sleep in my
  bedroom.
Archie Goodwin: Really? Your husband, uh, allows that, huh?
Mrs. Ballou: I doubt he even knows it.

Archie Goodwin: [to Julie] I doubt you could be smooth-tongued into
  anything that you wouldn't want to be smooth-tongued into... but
  more on that later.

Archie Goodwin: What do you swear on? The Bible?
Julie Jaquette: No, some of the men in it are awful. So are the
  women. We'll shake.

Julie Jaquette: [describing her dead friend] She had a good, big
  heart, but she never let it bleed.

Nero Wolfe: If Orrie killed that woman, we are not obliged to thwart
  the agents of justice. If he didn't kill her, I have an obligation
  I can't ignore. You know I have no affection for him. The question
  is, is he capable of murder? Did he kill this woman? Fred. You have
  known Orrie longer than I have. What do you say?
Fred Durkin: Jesus.
Archie Goodwin: Oh, that's helpful. Did he kill her?
Fred Durkin: I say he didn't.
Nero Wolfe: Is that your considered opinion?
Fred Durkin: To be honest, no. Orrie has always done whatever he felt
  like with women, and they've let him. So if this Isabel Kerr got in
  his way, really blocked it... Well, I don't know. I mean I think I
  know. He didn't.
Nero Wolfe: That's hardly decisive. Saul?
Saul Panzer: No.
Nero Wolfe: Is that an opinion, or a gesture?
Saul Panzer: A conclusion. Make it fifty to one. I'm not saying I'm
  superior to Archie. He's just not conceited enough to see it.
Nero Wolfe: Pfui. That is flummery.
Saul Panzer: No, sir. Say he did plan to kill her. That means when he
  planned the break-in with Archie on Friday night, he was setting
  Archie up to find the body. There's no way that he would
  deliberately arrange to sit facing him and frame a deal like that.
Archie Goodwin: All right, cross it off. Let's say he went there
  Saturday morning, no matter why. And she stung him. And he flipped.
Saul Panzer: And he killed her. Okay. He goes back to his tailing
  job. Mr. Wolfe, did Archie get any phone calls yesterday?
Nero Wolfe: No.
Saul Panzer: Yeah. That's what settles it.
Archie Goodwin: Good. Wonderful. Explain.
Saul Panzer: What is Orrie's worst fault?
Archie Goodwin: He pushes.
Saul Panzer: Exactly. And you called him. If he had killed her he
  wouldn't wait for you to call, he would have pushed. He would have
  called you. Damn it, he's not some stranger that we have to guess
  about; we know him like a book. Mr. Wolfe, if you want to use me,
  it's on me, expenses included. I have no more affection for Orrie
  than you have, but I would want to back up my vote.
Fred Durkin: Me too. I voted no.
Archie Goodwin: The trouble is, I'm personally involved. But I would
  hate to embarrass Saul, so I guess I'll have to switch and vote no,
  too.
Nero Wolfe: Grrrhhh.
Archie Goodwin: [voiceover] It was hard to take. The idea of working
  for nothing.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Die Like a Dog (#2.4)}
Sergeant Purley Stebbins: [referring to Jet] He should have bit you
  when you kidnapped him.
Archie Goodwin: Ah, you got it wrong, Purley. It's women who bite me.
  You know, I've often wondered who bites you. What bites you? Where
  do they bite you?

Archie Goodwin: [referring to Jewel] She had the damsel-in-distress
  bit down to a science.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Disguise for Murder (#1.7)}
Saul Panzer: [speaking of security at the flower show] You should put
  your foot down, Archie. From the security standpoint with all his
  enemies in New York, just let people walk in?
Archie Goodwin: Security's simple. You just don't let in anyone who's
  not wearing pearls.

Archie Goodwin: [after speaking on the phone] That's Mr. Wolfe. He
  needs me upstairs for protection. He apparently didn't realize
  there's women in the Manhattan Flower Club.

Nero Wolfe: Pay no attention, Fritz! We still have plenty of ham
  left?
Fritz Brenner: Yes, sir!
Nero Wolfe: Good!
[lividly angry]
Nero Wolfe: Sandwiches for us, for the guests in the front room...
[screaming]
Nero Wolfe: but not for the police! The police shall receive no
  sandwiches!

Nero Wolfe: I nearly cracked my head using my brains.

Nero Wolfe: The police shall receive NO SANDWICHES!


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Door to Death (#1.8)}
Archie Goodwin: [waiting for an apprehensive Wolfe to get out of the
  car and step in the snow] Let's do it! C'mon while we're young!
  [sarcastically commenting on Wolfe's awkwardness walking in the
  snow] Indeed, just like Ray Bolger!

Archie Goodwin: [reacting to a proposed bribe by Mrs. Pitcairn] I was
  liking this more and more. We had our pick of goin' to jail and
  taking fifty grand.

Nero Wolfe: [affronted] I fully expect you to lie! A fool could solve
  a case if everyone told the truth!

Nero Wolfe: All I want is a talk with you people. May I sit down?
Mr. Joseph Pitcairn, Donald Pitcairn, Sybil Pitcairn: No!
Nero Wolfe: I must overrule you.

Nero Wolfe: [after he has fallen while tangled in brush] It was as if
  a serpent had entangled my legs!
Archie Goodwin: Get up. Get up. GET UP!
Nero Wolfe: Did you see that? Did you witness that? Saul?
Saul Panzer: Yeah, I saw it, Mr. Wolfe. He went for 'ya.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Eeny, Meeny, Murder, Moe (#1.6)}
Archie Goodwin: As I entered the front room, there were words on the
  tip of my tongue - apparently that's as far as they got.

Archie Goodwin: I decided not to waste the first lie of the day and
  tell her the absolute truth.

Rita Ramsey Sorrell: You mentoned my husband. Are you brave?
Archie Goodwin: Well, I would be if you were watching.

Archie Goodwin: If you're a real top flight detective like me, you'd
  rather go after an alibi than the truth.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Help Wanted, Male (#2.12)}
Jane Geer: Fat coward!
Nero Wolfe: I hired this man, not out of cowardice but conceit. I am
  insufferably conceited. Should I be killed, I doubted that the
  murderer would ever be caught.

Archie Goodwin: Now listen, Tiger Eyes, do you see me sneaking up
  behind you?
Jane Geer: I should have known you have so many women you have to
  issue ration coupons, and yet you find so much time for me.
Archie Goodwin: Well, you know why?
Jane Geer: Do I?
Archie Goodwin: Tou've got a mirror.
Jane Geer: [pleased and purring] Mmmmm.

Archie Goodwin: [to Wolfe] Look, I admit that you're a great
  detective, a champion beer drinker, and a genius, but this is a
  hell of a way to spend a war. If Carpenter calls, and you tell him
  you can't do without me, I am going to put gristle in your
  crabmeeat and sugar in your beer.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Immune to Murder (#2.16)}
Spiros Papps: You know, there is nothing as petty as a big man.
  Little men are rarely as petty as big men.

Adria Kelefy: [to Archie as he's fishing] Who's the biggest fish you
  ever caught?
Archie Goodwin: The biggest fish I ever caught - that'd have to be,
  uh, Frankie the, uh, Shark D'Angelo.
Adria Kelefy: Was he difficult to catch?
Archie Goodwin: Yes, he put up quite a struggle.

Nero Wolfe: I resent your tone, your diction, and your methods.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Motherhunt: Part 1 (#2.6)}
Lucy Valdon: My only controversial hobby is killer fog.
Archie Goodwin: [taken aback] Fog kills?
Lucy Valdon: 32 people in 1948 - small little coal town in
  Pennsylvania.
Archie Goodwin: [sarcastically] What'd they do? Get lost in the fog
  and fall into the mine? Something like that?
Lucy Valdon: There is no humor in it.
Archie Goodwin: [Chastened] Um, oh, none really.

Archie Goodwin: Miss Tenzer probably aroused in men the feelings
  necessary for the propagation of the species.

Anne Tenzer: That's my one fault. I'm not really interested in
  anything that doesn't involve me.

Nero Wolfe: [addressing the suspects] To get rid of the baby, she
  enlisted the help of a friend - a man. Let's call him X.
Manuel Upton: [sarcastically] Make it Z. X is overworked.

Lucy Valdon: Were you followed?
Archie Goodwin: Only if he was very good.

Archie Goodwin: [on seeing Lucy's mansion] It was a modest little
  cottage with just enough room for the Russian army.

Lucy Valdon: It is nonsense to suspect me.
Nero Wolfe: Nothing is nonsense concerning the vagaries of human
  conduct.

Lon Cohen: Goodwin, you've got the nerve of a one-legged man in an
  ass-kicking contest.

Nero Wolfe: Nothing corrupts a man so deeply as writing a book.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Murder Is Corny (#2.5)}
Sergeant Purley Stebbins: [nastily as he sees Archie with a plate of

Archie Goodwin: [sardonically] Edible would have been enough.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Over My Dead Body: Part 1 (#1.10)}
Archie Goodwin: It's un-American not to earn as much money as you
  can.

Nero Wolfe: As soon as I heard that girl's voice, I knew the devil
  was around.

Archie Goodwin: [referring to Neya] She was a queer combination of
  don't-touch-me and come-hither. Right now it was all come-hither.

Archie Goodwin: [referring to Madame Zorka] She looked like the
  picture in my mother's old Bible of the dame that cut off Samson's
  hair.

Nat Driscoll: I like this place, Miltan. I've been overweight for
  years, and this is the only thing I can do to sweat that is any
  fun.

Inspector Cramer: I hate these foreign mixups. Give me an American
  murder, an American motive.

Nero Wolfe: Cicero warns us that the more laws a country has, the
  less justice there will be.

Nero Wolfe: I carry this fat to insulate my feelings.

Sergeant Purley Stebbins: So watcha got in the package?
Archie Goodwin: Oh, uh, daggers, uh, narcotics, smuggled goods, and a
  small illegal immigrant. You wanna have a look?
Sergeant Purley Stebbins: Go to Hell!
Archie Goodwin: Alrighty, well, see ya on the corner of Fire and
  Brimstone.

Nero Wolfe: Money and morals are barely on speaking terms.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Poison à la Carte (#2.8)}
Nero Wolfe: [gleefully to the murderer] This is not the trap. The

Lieutenant Rowcliff: And you had the gall to come here and try to
  cover for him by telling another outrageous lie.
Archie Goodwin: You know, I've taken great pleasure in lying to you
  in the past and surely will lie to you again

Archie Goodwin: If you get disbarred for this operation, I can get
  you a job folding napkins.

Nero Wolfe: As you may know, Mr. Goodwin is not indifferent to those
  attributes of young women which contribute the chief reliance of
  our race in our gallant struggle against the menace of the insects.
  He is also especially vulnerable to those young women who have the
  knack of stimulating his love of chivalry and adventure.

Bernard Quest: I have been in this company 62 years. In 1933, when I
  was made Vice-President by Nathan Eads, he promised me that one day
  I would be given a substantial share in the corporation. In 1942 he
  died, and when his will was read, I found he had broken his promise
  to me, and so I decided to kill his daughter Priscilla. She was 15
  years old. I decided to strangle her.
Viola Duday: [screaming] Bernie!
Sarah Jaffee: [shocked] My God!
Nero Wolfe: I even worked out the details - where to find a rope, how
  to employ it, what to do with afterward, and I practiced... I
  practiced by strangling myself.
Nero Wolfe: [coughs while Wolfe nods in understanding] But that was
  ten years ago, and in the end, I finally came to my senses. I
  didn't kill her then and... Oh, what's the point? I'm too old, my
  children are grown, and I have everything I need.
Nero Wolfe: [laconically] Oh, perhaps you should have stangled
  yourself.

Archie Goodwin: [walking into the room] I'm hungry! I had a soda
  fountain lunch. I could eat a porcupine with quills on it. Let's go
  home!

Nero Wolfe: You are disheveled.
Archie: Also dislumbered. Also disgruntled.

Nero Wolfe: You say, "stop him." I take it you mean, compel the FBI
  to stop annoying you?
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: Yes.
Nero Wolfe: How?
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: I don't know.
Nero Wolfe: Nor do I. No, madam. You invited it, and you have it.
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: [trying to goad Wolfe] I thought you were afraid
  of nobody and nothing.
Nero Wolfe: [unruffled] I can dodge folly without backing into fear.

Sarah Dacos: Say, Mr. Goodwin, you could have gone upstairs. I can't
  hear through walls.
Archie: No? You might be wired for sound and there's only one way to
  find out and... I'm not sure you'd enjoy it.
Sarah Dacos: How do you know I wouldn't?

Mrs. Rachel Bruner: [gushing] Is there anything you can't do?
Nero Wolfe: Yes, madame, there is. I couldn't put sense into a fool's
  brain if I tried.

[first lines]
Archie: [narrating] Since it was the deciding factor, I might as well
  begin by describing it. It was a pink slip of paper three inches
  wide and seven inches long, and it told the First National City
  Bank to pay to the order of Nero Wolfe fifty thousand dollars.
  Signed, Rachel Bruner, the widow of Lloyd Bruner. At least eight of
  the several dozen buildings Bruner left his wife were more than
  twelve stories high.

Mrs. Rachel Bruner: Do I need to tell you who I am?
Nero Wolfe: Mr. Goodwin named you, and I read newspapers.
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: I know you do. I know a great deal about you.
  That's why I'm here. I want you to do something perhaps no other
  man alive could do. You read books too? Have you read one entitled
  "The F.B.I. Nobody Knows?"
Nero Wolfe: Yes.
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: Did it impress you?
Nero Wolfe: [pausing] Yes.
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: Favorably?
Nero Wolfe: Yes.
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: My goodness, you're curt.
Nero Wolfe: I answered your questions, madam.
Mrs. Rachel Bruner: I know you did. I can be curt, too.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {The Next Witness (#2.3)}
Nero Wolfe: [demanding to know about the Van Gogh painting on the
  wall] I'm the inquisator, Miss Hart, not you! Where did you get
  that piece?
Alice Hart: That's none of yer business!
Nero Wolfe: [indignantly] It most certainly is not, but I will tell
  you that there will be no limit to my impertinence with you!

Archie Goodwin: Naturally the first time Wolfe was under his roof
  Saul wanted to give him good grub. Okay! But three kinds of cheese
  was pounding it on!

Archie Goodwin: By 8 o'clock Wolfe had put away three orders of chili
  con carne at a little dump in Harlem, where a guy named Dixie knew
  how to make it.
Nero Wolfe: Chili is one of the great peasant foods. It is one of the
  few contributions America has to world cuisine. Eaten with corn
  bread, sweet onion, sour cream, it contains all five of the
  elements deemed essential by the sages of the Orient: sweet, sour,
  salty, pungent, and bitter. It begins...

D.A. Mandelbaum: Did Leonard Ashe say anything else to you? [pause as
  Wolfe is contemplating his answer] Mr. Wolfe?
Nero Wolfe: I would like to be sure I understand the question. Do you
  mean, what he said that day, or on a later occasion?
D.A. Mandelbaum: That day, of course. But... what other occasion?
Nero Wolfe: Are you asking me?
D.A. Mandelbaum: In your deposition, you swore you hadn't met Leonard
  Ashe before or after July 13th.
Nero Wolfe: That was true then. We met again.
D.A. Mandelbaum: When?
Nero Wolfe: In this building at half past eight this morning.
D.A. Mandelbaum: You met and spoke with the defendant in this
  building at half past eight this morning, today?
Nero Wolfe: His wife arranged to see him, and she allowed me to
  accompany her.
D.A. Mandelbaum: Was Mr. Donovan, the defense counsel, present?
Nero Wolfe: No,sir.
Jimmy Donovan: Your Honor, I would like to state for the record that
  I knew nothing of this.
D.A. Mandelbaum: Don't you know that it's a misdemeanor for a witness
  for the state to speak with a defendant charged with a felony?
Nero Wolfe: We didn't discuss my testimony.
D.A. Mandelbaum: What did you discuss?
Nero Wolfe: Matters which I thought would be of interest to him.
D.A. Mandelbaum: What exactly did you say, Mr. Wolfe?
Archie Goodwin: *narrating* The fat son of a gun had put it over.
  Having asking him directly, Mandelbaum couldn't possibly keep
  Wolfe's theories from the jury unless Jimmy Donovan was a sap.
Judge Corbett: Do you wish to withdraw the question, Mr. Mandelbaum?
D.A. Mandelbaum: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm absolutely fascinated,
  you didn't discuss your testimony, what did you discuss?


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {The Silent Speaker: Part 1 (#2.13)}
Archie Goodwin: In the land of the secretaries a moment can mean
  anything from ten seconds to ten minutes.

Phoebe Gunther: I have nothing to lie about.
Nero Wolfe: Phooey! Everybody has something to lie about!

Nero Wolfe: A woman who is not a fool is dangerous.

Archie Goodwin: The scientific name for that disease of you got is
  acute malignant optimism.


# "A Nero Wolfe Mystery" (2001) {Too Many Clients: Part 1 (#2.9)}
Austin Hough: Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out. Treason doth
  never prosper. Fear not, Mr. Goodwin, I am laden with neither.

Meg Duncan: I wish I had clawed your eyes out!
Archie Goodwin: [nonplussed] Can I get your autograph?

Archie Goodwin: Do you like to watch?
Meg Duncan: [pausing in a sexy tone] I like to BE watched.
Archie Goodwin: [casually] Yeh? Well, watch out.

Archie Goodwin: [after Lon refers to him as Wolfe's lacky] Hold on!
  The whole world knows I'm not a lacky. I'm a, uh, flunkie.

Archie Goodwin: If you forget my curiosity about Thomas Yaeger...
Lon Cohen: Okay.
Archie Goodwin: ...I will put you on my Christmas list.
Lon Cohen: Christmas? Cohen is spelled C - O - H - E - N.

Archie Goodwin: Too many clients are worse than too few.

[Donald has demonstrated his love for Betty by organising a surprise
  hot-air balloon flight after their son's wedding]
Betty: [voiceover] As I looked into Donald's eyes, I realised that he
  *did* love me. His crime was not to show it. Craze was passionate
  and he woke a passion up in me. But maybe that's not love. Maybe
  true love is, as Donald puts it, hanging in there when you know
  you're not wanted, being there for your other half - whatever. What
  I know is, for the first time in years, I feel a glimmer of hope
  for the future.

Laura: When is Westminster going to wake up? Stand up for us and
  think of our future generations? When are they going to stop giving
  British sperm a bad name?
Gareth: British sperm! What kind of a remark is that?
Simon: Very ballsy.
Gareth: Bloody rude.
Simon: But she does seem to be speaking for the people.
Gareth: No no no. We speak for the people, thank you. The people
  don't know enough to speak for themselves, and the last thing we
  need is any untutored outbursts of democratic demagoguery popping
  up like boils on our buttocks. I think you'd better go and have a
  sniff around.
Simon: Oh. All right. Where is Flatby?
Gareth: I don't know, Simon, look at a map. They have fish, so it's
  probably on the coast.
Simon: Thank you, Gareth. Most helpful.

Laura: You should have been helping to save one of our leading
  fishermen.
Winston: [laughs] Harry Patterson's a brain-dead mullet who couldn't

Laura: People of Europe. people of England, idiots of Whitehall.
  Listen to us, the people of Flatby. This is Harry Patterson,
  fisherman. His dad built this boat with his own hands, but guess
  what; the government, our government, and the deranged ding-a-lings
  of Brussels in ten days time are going to crush this boat to
  matchwood and put Harry on the scrapheap of permanent unemployment.

Laura: I don't know why you don't get out of Flatby altogether,
  darling. I mean, you're educated. You're a solicitor. You can ruin
  people's lives anywhere.
Julie: I'm quite happy here, thank you.
Laura: But how can you be? Misery's the main qualification for living
  in Flatby-on-the-Bog. And inbreeding, of course.

Laura: If things are so bad here, why don't you both go back to
  Battersea?
Laura: Chelsea. We lived in South Chelsea, thank you.
Johnny: Views of the river.
Deidre: From both toilets.

Winston: You can't blackmail me with a twenty year old affair.
Laura: Okay! Okay! How about a two month old affair, then? You and
  the Honourable Daphne Borthwick.
Winston: How the hell did you know about that?
Laura: Suddenly the Hon. Daph starts drinking rum and coke with a
  cock-eyed grin on her face. I know when a woman round here's been
  Winstoned!

Gareth: [dictating into a small recorder] To the Minister. Sir: With
  regard to your wife's request for the return of the curved cucumber
  to our shops. Please, could you tell the good lady that it has
  taken the European Community seven years and forty million pounds

Julie: We don't like your sort here.

  gives me great pleasure as Head of the Administrative Board of the
  Indepndent State of Flatby to inaugurate this border crossing and
  unveil this wonderful sign.

Deidre: Historic tours.
Malcolm: But there was no battle in this playground!
Deidre: Yes, there was; Johnny said so.
Malcolm: But it's not the truth!

Gareth: I already have a seasoned diplomat down there; just join up
  with him, and let him handle everything.
Bill Jarvis M.P.: Well, uh, well, why should I?

  having all the subtlety and charm of a truck smash at a Dolly
  Parton concert. So...

Bill Jarvis M.P.: Now, Winston, what do you want for your support at

Gareth: Bit of grovelling poverty. That should fix the grubby little
  upstarts.
Simon: But is it legal to cut off their funds?
Gareth: Legal? Who cares! We're the government; we decide what's
  legal.
Simon: We're not actually the government, Gareth. We work *for* the
  government.
Gareth: Oh, really. Thank you. I'll note that down.
Simon: And is it moral? Is it in the tradition of British fair play?
  We just might look like a bunch of big bullies.
Gareth: We *are* a bunch of big bullies. We built an empire on being
  a bunch of big bullies. We enjoy being a bunch of big bullies.
  These people are traitors. In more enlightened times we would have
  just cut their heads off and had another cup of tea.
Simon: I, I just feel your being a bit... mean.
Gareth: I sincerely hope so. Now, while I conduct the practical
  shenanigans up here, I want you to keep up the fifth column stuff
  down there; undermine 'em, turn 'em against each other; nice bit of
  weasel work.
Simon: Gareth, I'm not sure I really like...
Gareth: Simon, Simon, hush hush a second. You do know that despite
  what they say about the civil service, your career is not exactly
  bomb-proof. And you do cherish and enjoy your insignificant little
  job, don't you.
Simon: You really are a quite awful person.
Gareth: Thank you, Simon. It is nice to know one's efforts don't go
  entirely unnoticed. Now get down there, get nasty, or get
  downsized.

Simon: I do wish you'd stop all this independence nonsense.
Laura: Why? Why the hell should we?
Simon: Because then we could be proper friends.
Laura: I rather doubt it. I like my friends to be vertebrates, thank
  you. Not spineless little newts wiggling about in a civil service

Simon: Well, not a problem, but I would say: 'Cave posteriorum'.
Gareth: What?
Simon: Look out for your backside.


# "A Perfect State" (1997) {(#1.4)}
Simon: They'll take us to court to get their power back on again.
Gareth: Which is just what we want.
Simon: But we've been through this. If we go to court, they might get
  legal recognition for their independence. What's different this
  time?
Gareth: This time the minister has preempted possible adverse
  complications by engaging in lengthy discourse with certain
  provincial legal representatives.
Simon: You've bribed the judge.
Gareth: We do not bribe. We merely conjoin in smoke-filled rooms
  where we float subtly suggested inferences related to life, the
  universe, and their future career prospects.
Simon: Who is the poor sod?
Gareth: Justice Derek Dimkins, who I gather is about as trustworthy
  as a ferret in your Y-fronts; so I want you to pop down there and
  make sure he doesn't wander off the path of righteousness.
Simon: I can't interfere with the course of justice.

[Contractors' signs outside derelict houses]
Frost: "Gas off". "Water off". "Electricity off". All that's missing
  is "Sod off"!

Frost: Yeah, well, I just wish Horn-rimmed Harry would be a little
  more choosy about his jargon. I mean anyone who spends all day with
  their pen stuck up their a-aah, there you are, sir!

Desk Sgt.: Mr Mullet wants to see you as soon as you come in.
Frost: I'll let you know when that is.

Frost: I went to London once, to see the Queen. She was a bit smaller
  than I imagined, but as we both know size isn't everything.

Frost: I'd like to stay and talk, but I've got to be in church in ten
  minutes.

Frost: Why don't you get a television like everyone else?

Supt. Mullett: One of these days you'll realize you need more than
  your well-known intuition in order to get results.
Frost: I used more than my well-known intuition, sir, at least in one
  of the cases I did - I used my charm.
[pause]
Frost: It's a joke, sir, don't bother to work it out.

[on Mullett's orders to catch graveyard vandals]
Frost: I've only got three blokes who can barely stand up, let alone
  chase a box of black magic!

[examining murder victim]
Dr McKenzie: I'd guess from the obstruction in his throat that he
  probably choked on his own vomit.
Frost: Better than choking on someone else's vomit, I suppose.

Supt. Mullett: I've had a telephone call from the vicar of St.
  Paul's. He's very concerned about this outbreak of vandalism in the
  old churchyard.
Frost: I'm not surprised, sir. It's a very grave business.

Frost: No, it's not him. He's too stupid.

Supt. Mullett: [on radio] Although it's only a matter of some three
  days since the girl's body was discovered in the church crypt, my
  officers have been working around the clock to bring the
  perpetrator of this appalling crime to justice, and I can assure
  your listeners that an arrest will be made very shortly.
Frost: [listening at home] Oh, yeah?

Frost: Were any of the others here on Sunday? Children? And a simple
  yes or no will do, Annie. I don't want a bloody lecture!

Frost: Times are hard, Clive, my son. Try and be a bit more
  charitable. You sell what you got available. Tell you what, though,
  she's nicked my bloody fags! Should have turned right there, by the
  way. Didn't I say?

[Frost's wife has just died]
Frost: The other night I sat there. All night I sat there, trying to
  feel something. She was my wife, and she was dying, and I couldn't
  feel anything for her. Things started to go wrong for us God knows
  how many years ago. When we found out she couldn't have kids, I
  don't know, she just changed. We changed. She suddenly became all
  house proud. Everything had to be clean and neat and tidy. Well,
  you've only got to take one look at me. With my job. I'm a street
  copper, that's where I belong. But that wasn't good enough for her
  now. She wanted me to go for promotion, to be ambitious, to make
  something of myself. She wanted something to be proud of, you see.
  And what the poor cow got was me. She came to despise me in the
  end. I know she did. I used to dread going home, to see that look
  of disappointment in her face. So I stopped going home. You know,
  it was any excuse. Anyway, I, uh... I met someone else. When don't
  you? I made up my mind to leave her. On the very day that I plucked
  up the courage to tell her, her doctor phoned me at the station.
  "She's got cancer. Eighteen months to live", so they reckon. She
  always had trouble with her stomach. She thought it was nerves, or
  one thing or another. Anyway, she wanted to know. She hoped she
  could cope. She went to pieces. She clung to me for the first time
  in years, her whole body shaking. "You will look after me, Billy?
  You will look after me, Billy? You'll look after me, won't you?" I
  said, of course I'll look after you. Of course I'll stay and take
  care of you. I went out and I got so drunk, and I was still drunk
  when this call came through about this nutter with a gun. And
  before they could stop me, I was moving in on him. Do you know what
  I was thinking? All I was thinking was, "Go on, you bugger, shoot
  me. 'Cause I don't give a damn one way or the other." And for this
  outstanding act of heroism, I got a medal. I think that was the
  happiest day of her life, you know. She was standing next to me in
  my top hat at Buckingham Palace. At last I'd done something to make
  her proud of me. And I wasn't even there when she died. She would
  have liked that. "You even let me down on that, Billy. Can't trust
  you to do anything."

DS George Toolan: Mr Mullett's in a flap!
Frost: I know! I'm still pulling feathers out of my hair!

[Frost has rushed to a river to rescue a teenage boy]
Supt. Mullett: Don't, Jack - You'll drown!
Frost: Yes, anything to please you, sir!

  rundown on the filing system, shall we? [Pointing out three piles

D.C.I. Allen: All you got is the uncorroburated word of a three year
  old.
DI Frost: Then I'll corroborate it.

DI Frost: Sandy, you're in the finest traditions of journalism. You
  know, I've always saidthis about you... you never let the truth get
  in the way of a good story.

P.C. Ernie Trigg: You got a minute?

Frost: [His mouth full] Unh-huh, yeah.
Dentist: I'm forever parking in the wrong place.
Dentist: [With a sadistic tone] Toffee lollipops are a bit like
  parking tickets.
Frost: Are they?
Dentist: [Obviously enjoying Frost's discomfort] Stick like hell...
Frost: Yeah.
Dentist: ...and a bugger to get off sometimes.
Frost: [In pain] Uh, oh, oh, I suppose.

Frost: Right, Doc, what have we got here?
Dr McKenzie: A dismembered corpse, Inspector.
Frost: [Sarcastically] Oh, well, not the kind of thing you want to
  find in your fridge when you come home from the holidays, is it,
  Doc?

Frost: Sewer rats go out at night, and there's one particular rat I
  want to get before he goes down his hole.

Frost: He was a bigamist all right, I suppose. Just thinking about it
  makes me tired.

Frost: When in doubt, shout. It scares the horses.

# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Care and Protection (#1.1)}
Supt. Mullett: Of course, the irony of it all is that if the girl's
  mother had been twenty minutes earlier, that body probably would
  have remained in those woods for another thirty years.
Frost: That's the first thing that struck me, sir, is the irony of it
  all. I remember saying to DC Barnard as they carted Powell and his
  wife off to the morgue..."How ironic", I said.

Frost: [to Barnard] A word of advice, son - well, two words. One,
  ever tell Mr. Mullet that I'm in the office, and, two, never wear a
  suit that you wouldn't be happy letting a drunk be sick over.

Dr. McKenzie: [Sarcastically examinung the skeletal hand they've
  found] You called me a little late I'm afraid. An hour earlier I
  could have saved him.
Frost: Hmmm... I know I tried to give him the kiss of life, but he
  stuck his fingers up my nose.

  Phyllis? The old man having a heart attack and popping off like
  that.
Phyllis Bowman: The medical profession was dumbfounded, and that was
  just the private sector. He had the body of a twenty-year-old.
Frost: Mmm, a bit too often, by all accounts.
Phyllis Bowman: You know the story, I've been robbed.
Frost: Yeah, sad. Isn't that sad, Constable?

Stella Massie: Oh, come now, Inspector! Twice in the past...
Frost: Twice in the past, your son has been charged with reckless
  driving. And twice in the past, he's got away with it- Sorry, he's
  been proved not guilty.
Stella Massie: He *was* not guilty.
Frost: And if he's not guilty this time, I shall be the first one to
  give him a lollipop.

Frost: [Sarcastically, showing his ID to the doorman] Armenian
  Express! Tell Mrs. Bowman the Sheriff of Nottingham has arrived.

Frost: [Referring to a photo of Massie and his mother] Here's him
  with Mummy. [Sarcastically] If you look, you can still see the
  umbillical cord.

Frost: [Rhetorically] Who knows what goes through your mind when you
  blow someone's head off?

Frost: You know what I think, Miss... ?
Sophie: ...Hamilton.
Frost: Hamilton, I've got this theory - for every bit of bad luck you
  get compensated by a bit of good.
Sophie: [Disinterested] Is that what they call lateral thinking?

D.I. Frost: Terrible thing... unmissed... unidentified. Yes, but
  suppose he isn't missing. see what you're sayin'? I mean to be
  missing. I mean think about it. You live and you die, and the
  difference doesn't affect a single person in the whole world. It's
  as if you hadn't been here in the first place

[King gets up to leave]
Frost: What time did you get back today?

D.S. Toolan: [to Frost] Alleged assault on a first year student -
  Helen Tudor by name, stunning by nature. Brains, beauty, and modest
  with it. Just the sort you'd kill for.

Dr. Keith Michaelson: [to Frost] To be precise because I wouldn't
  want to misinform you on what is clearly a crucial matter - water's
  not keen on me! My skin's allergic to chlorine and salt, which
  makes anything more watery than a shower a distinctly unpleasant
  experience... rather like being in the same room with you!

Sandy Longford: If there was a faculty of Discreet Sexual
  Harrassment, Michaelson would be head of the department.

Sandy Longford: [Having a drink at the bar] Are you willing to engage
  in casual sex?
Frost: Not with you I'm not.
Sandy Longford: Would you consider having an affair with a married
  man?
Frost: Are you all right, Sandy, or what?
Sandy Longford: Never better. [Motioning for them to sit down at a
  table] Spare a minute?
Frost: I'm not sure I dare.

D.I. Frost: [Speaking about a dead gigolo] What I can't understand,
  though, is what did he get out of it? Apart from her pickin' up the
  bills, I mean. I mean, you know, young good-lookin' fella like that

  think that. George had a life that wasn't just about being a
  policeman. In fact I think it was most of his life. And I know that

  without a torch.
Frost: So you get a bit of a thrill out of it, do you?

Frost: [Sarcastically referring to Sharpe's obvious attraction to
  Martine Phillips] Only I was wondering if it was your moody
  enigmatic personality with its scintilating wit that she fancied or
  whether it was something more basic like sex.
D.S. Sharpe: It's sex, I hope.
Frost: Oh, well, we all live in hope.

Frost: I know he's tellin' porkies, and priests shouldn't do that.

Martine Phillips: I think in this case the knifing's down to pure
  male anger and rage. Your killer is living an emotionally shut down
  life.
Frost: That could apply to half the male population in the country.

Frost: You don't know anything about goin' to church, do you?
D.S. Sharpe: Weddings and funerals mostly. I've had the one and I'm

  the back of the head, and according to the pathologist, he was
  unconscious *before* the fire started. So, apart from the imaginary
  Mr. Lawrence Tidyman, who else stood to gain by knocking your
  husband unconscious and leaving him to die in that fire? You think

Frost: No, I tell you what gets right up my nose and that is people
  who go and live in America and after ten minutes end up talkin'

Frost: [Sarcastically, to Mrs. Compton] You know what common people
  are like. Give us a drop of caviar and we're yellin' for rock
  salmon.

Supt. Mullett: I've had a telephone call from the vicar of St.
  Paul's. He's very concerned about this outbreak of vandalism in the
  old churchyard.
Frost: I'm not surprised, sir. It's a very grave business.

Frost: Get on the radio to the station, son. Tell sergeant Wells
  we've found a body in the churchyard.


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Nothing to Hide (#2.3)}
DI Frost: Wait, Costello, we all know you've had trouble settling in
  here, but don't you shake your beads at me, hey, son, because I'm
  inclined to get ever so irritable.

Supt. Mullett: [Slightly inebriated] Look, Jack, we've had our
  differences... of course, we have. You're a street cop. I'm one of
  those boring old farts who thinks about nothing but keeping the
  books straight. No, no, no need to deny it. I know what you chaps
  think of me, and to some extent, it's true. I've spent more time in
  college than I have on the street, and I'm...
DS Toolan: [Handing him a vodka and tonic] Sir!
Supt. Mullett: ...and I'll have to admit that when it comes to the
  practical side of policing, sometimes I'm out of my depth. Will you
  take my point, Jack?
DI Frost: [Humoring him] Yes, yes, I do... absolutely, sir.

DC Costello: [Looking around at the dirty public washroom where the
  body was found] Not the sort of place you come to for the holidays,
  is it?

Walter Peters: Did you know that more people die at 4 o"clock in the
  mornin' than at any other time? Except in China.

Eileen Grant: [to Frost] You're not exactly Warren Beatty.


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {One Man's Meat (#6.2)}
D.I. Frost: Is it true what they say, George?
D.S. Toolan: Yeah?
D.I. Frost: The more you know about people, the more you appreciate
  dogs.

D.S. Toolan: Questions are raised; we have to answer them.

Allen Deering: What kind of gobbledygook is that?
D.I. Frost: [Angrily] The correct gobbledygook!

D.I. Frost: I tell you what, I don't know much about this business,
  but there are those who say that if you eat meat, then you
  shouldn't be squeamish about watching an animal being killed and
  cut up. Perhaps you'd like to show me round.
Gerry Ryan: I've got work to do, Inspector.
D.I. Frost: [Angrily] So have I! That's why I'm here!


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Paying the Price (#4.1)}
Graham McArdy: [to Linda] Don't worry about the police. They're not

# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Penny for the Guy (#5.1)}
Sir Richard Cordwell: You're a bastard, frost!
D.I. Frost: Takes one to know one.

Supt. Mullett: [Testily] You have no business giving him your word!
D.I. Frost: That's all right, sir. I have no intention of keeping it.
  I'm a bit like Tricky Dickie in there. I do things my way.

Kitty Rayford: I couldn't send you back to your wife in that state.
D.I. Frost: You'd have a job, Kitty. She's dead.
Kitty Rayford: [after a pause] Sorry.
D.I. Frost: Yeah, that's all right.
Kitty Rayford: Must ne lonely without her.
D.I. Frost: It was lonely with her, to tell you the truth.

Supt. Mullett: [as Frost is wading into a stream] Jack! You'll drown
  yourself!
D.I. Frost: [Sarcastically] Anything for you, sir.


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Private Lives (#6.3)}
DI Frost: Years I've been in the job. You can't believe the secrets
  that people keep.


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Quarry (#3.2)}
Supt. Mullett: Eccentrics are only tolerated so long as they come up
  with the goods. Bear that in mind.
DI Jack Frost: So I will, sir. [pause] Eccentric? Huh.

D.C. Clive Barnard: I was out of order yesterday. Losing my rag.
DI Jack Frost: Forget it. I'll just tell your uncle, the Chief
  Constable.
D.C. Clive Barnard: I'm sorry.
DI Jack Frost: That's all right. I'll tell you one little trick,
  though. Out of order is no good to anyone. Out of step is much
  better. That way you tread on the bits the other people miss.

DI Jack Frost: I'm not scared of dogs. It's women that frighten me.

DI Jack Frost: [Looking at a red-stained sweatshirt] Look at that.
  It's either blood or he's a messy eater.

Tony Walder: We need the money.
DI Jack Frost: A lot of people need the money. They don't become
  contract killers.

Shirley Fisher: [to Jack] Well, what makes you think you're such a
  wonderful catch? Sruffy, middle-aged copper who only comes home
  when he feels like it.

DI Jack Frost: I'll sleep on it, sir.
Supt. Mullett: [Sarcastically] Do that. Perhaps the answer will come
  to you in a dream.


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Stranger in the House (#2.4)}
Sgt. Arthur Hanlon: Is Jack up there, George?
DS George Toolan: No, he's nipped out to see Tara Holdsworth.
  Shouldn't be long. Anything important?
Sgt. Arthur Hanlon: Oh, Mullett's beating around for his crime report
  from last night and he hasn't signed it, that's all.
DS George Toolan: Oh well. Here goes.
[Toolan forges Frost's signature]
Sgt. Arthur Hanlon: You're getting quite good. Should try banknotes.
DS George Toolan: Ssh!

D.I. Frost: [to Tara] I'll catch him. No one controls me. Ask my
  superintendent.

Les Wingham: [Indignantly] I don't leap out at women in the woods.
  That's a pervert job.

D.I. Frost: I was called away on urgent inquiries.
Supt. Mullett: I've heard that one from you too often to believe it.
  Frankly, your attitude on these occasions does you no credit.
  You're a little old to play the errant schoolboy.

D.I. Frost: [to Wallace during car chase] If you get frightened, just
  close your eyes like 'm doin'.

Sgt. Hanlon: Can't win 'em all.
D.I. Frost: Why not?

D.I. Frost: [Angrily] Then why are you letting Mullett take me off
  the case?
D.C.I. Allen: Because at the end of the day you're just a detective
  inspector, not King of Denton.

Supt. Mullett: He doesn't look like a rapist.
D.I. Frost: They never do, do they?


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {The Things We Do for Love (#4.3)}
[Det. Sgt. Frank Nash has been given a message to phone his wife]
Frost: Bit young to be married.
Det. Sgt. Frank Nash: How old were you?
Frost: I asked first. Twenty Four.
Det. Sgt. Frank Nash: Same as me.
Frost: Okay, lets drop it.

Det. Sgt. Frank Nash: [Looking at two messy piles of files] Can I
  move this stuff, Guv?
Frost: That's Sgt. Pierson's. He had a two tier system... unsolved
  and unsolvable.

Det. Sgt. Frank Nash: I can't imagine you livin' down here, Guv.
Frost: Why? Not crummy enough?

Frost: I went to London once. Had to go and meet the Queen. She's a
  lot smaller than I thought she'd be, but, then again, size isn't
  eveything as we both know.

Frost: I'm Detective Inspector Frost. This is Detective Sergeant
  Nash.
Boris Ivanovich: You don't look like police.
Frost: When you get to CID, they let you wear your own clothes.

Frost: One of the golden rules of detection is if you don't find
  anything, keep looking.

Mrs. Charteris: [Refering to a neighbor's apartment across the
  street] Sometimes they leave the curtain open.
Frost: [Sarcastically] Why don't you get a television like everyone
  else?


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {True Confessions (#5.3)}
Charlie Fairclough: Takes a lot for a woman to bake a cake these
  days. You must be fitter than you look.

D.S. Toolan: Of all the cars in all the world, you had to bump into
  mine.
D.I. Frost: Yes, and that's the worst Peter Lorre impression I've
  ever heard.
D.S. Toolan: Yes. It's Bogart.


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Unknown Soldiers (#4.2)}
D.I. Frost: [to Mullett] If I read every piece of paper that landed
  on my desk, I'd never get out from behind it. [Sarcastically] I't's
  the rain forests I'm worried about.

D.I. Frost: I'v had nothin' but guns since I got up this morning.

Barry Hockey: [Ironically] Honesty is a hard habit to break.


# "A Touch of Frost" (1992) {Widows and Orphans (#2.2)}
D.C.I. Allen: [Talking about DI Lawson] She's a good-looker. I hope
  you don't find yourself tempted.
D.I. Frost: What? Sleep with a junior officer? Gawd dear! Mullet
  would love that, wouldn't he? Actually, Jim, I've lost the, henh,
  urge. You know... women. What's that... growin' up or growin' old?

D.I. Frost: [to Bernard] Now, listen. We've had quite a run on these
  burglaries, and what I want to know is, are they down to you? Now,
  a simple yes or no will suffice, and this is Police Brutality Week,
  so think carefully.

D.I. Frost: I got a season ticket to the late night laundrette.


# "A Very British Coup" (1988) {(#1.3)}
The Cabinet - Harry Perkins: In South America, they'd call this a
  coup d'état.
The Public Servants - Browne: But no firing squad, no torture or
  retribution. No bloodshed. A very British coup, wouldn't you say?


# "A Woman of Substance" (1984)
Young Emma Harte: [to Gerald, after he has attempted to rape her
  early in the film] I mean to ruin you... all of you. The entire
  Fairley family.

Gerald Fairley: [late in the film, after Emma has purchased
  everything the Fairleys once owned] How can you cold-bloodedly set
  out to ruin someone?
Young Emma Harte: That was my plan, but you did it yourself, really.
  I just helped you along the way.


# "A World Apart" (1969) {(1971-06-25)}
Rev. Walter King: I'm sort of at a loss. It's not that I object to
  rock christenings or anything like that. But I think we ought to
  have the baby present, don't you?

Olivia Hampton: On the way over here I was thinking of what I could
  say that would be of any value whatsoever. And instead of trusting
  to my own words I thought I'd read something that I read a long
  time ago about children. "You may house their bodies but not their
  souls, / For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you
  cannot visit, not even in your dreams. / For life goes not backward
  nor tarries with yesterday."

Betty Kahlman Barry: Wait! Wait just a minute.

Olive Doyle: Someone toss something out there. No idea is a bad idea.
Fletcher Quimby: How about a bake sale?
Olive Doyle: A BAKE SALE? SERIOUSLY FLETCHER, THINK!


# "A.N.T. Farm" (2011) {The PhANTom Locker (#1.3)}
Olive Doyle: Dust is mostly made of dead human skin. There is nothing
  I'm more scared of than dust. Well, except for ghosts, vampires,
  witches, zombies, leprechauns, giraffes, double decker buses,
  balloons and [shudders] curly fries.


# "A.N.T. Farm" (2011) {TransplANTed (#1.1)}

Ahmaad: [laughs] You a fish, man? [Craig shrugs] I mean, is this your
  first time in juvie?

Lubbock: [Lubbock is taking Craig to the infirmary after he's gotten
  a dumbbell dropped on his hand] Look Craig, I know what went on in
  there. I'll be watching those boys, but I want you to know you're
  an easy mark here.
Craig Foster: What do you mean?
Lubbock: You're young and small, and you don't come off the streets.
  And you're a whiner.
Craig Foster: What?
Lubbock: [mocking] "It's not my fault", "I didn't do anything"... you
  act like you don't belong here or something.
Craig Foster: I don't. I'm not like the rest of those guys. I'm no
  criminal.
Lubbock: Oh, I see. Everyone here is a criminal besides you.
Craig Foster: Well, they're different. You know what I mean.
Lubbock: No I don't! The way I see it, you've earned your way in
  there the same as everyone else.

Lubbock: [to Craig] Ahmaad and Vato Loco broke the law, that's why
  they're here. You broke the law, and that's why you're here.

Ahmaad: [Vato Loco has gone sprawling after Craig unwittingly takes a
  chair out from under him] Man, you did it this time.
Craig Foster: I didn't do anything!
Ahmaad: That was Vato Loco who fell down. That's kid's the craziest
  in the whole gang. He'll do anything, and you made him look bad.
  Big trouble, man!

Vato Loco: [to Craig in bunk after lights out] Hey ratonita... little

Jack Melon: Am I who? [both laugh] Hey man, look at that tree, all
  bent and twisted. It looks like Old Man Eber.
Teddy: Old man who?
Jack Melon: Old Man Eber. I walked past that tree hundreds of times
  and never saw him. How come I never noticed?
Teddy: 'Cause grass helps you see things clearer.
Jack Melon: I thought it was supposed to cloud things up.
Teddy: Just the opposite. You see things for less of what you want
  them to be and more for what they really are.

# "ALF" (1986)
ALF: [about Lucky] Last time I saw him he was high-tailing it out the
  window.
Willie: And why was that?
ALF: Cause I was chasing him with a fork.

ALF: I know my rights, I watch People's Court.

Brian: ALF wouldn't eat Lucky, would he?
ALF: I'm not saying nothing until I speak to my attorney.

Willie: Stay away from the window, we've got a very nosy neighbor -
  Mrs. Ochmonek.
ALF: Ochmonek? Sounds like a typo.

ALF: Willie. If a window was broken in the woods, but there was
  no-one there to hear it, would it really be broken?
Willie: If you were in the woods.

[catch phrase]
ALF: Haaa! I kill me.

ALF: On Melmac, we have 1st class, 2nd class and ham.

ALF: A minute and a half, Luckmiester, then I'll be down on you like
  a buzzard on a gut wagon.

ALF: I wasn't known on Melmac as the whiz kid for my scholastic
  ability.

ALF: Putting humans in charge of the earth, is the cosmic equivalence
  of letting Eddie Murphy direct.

ALF: How about a hug for the ol' ALFer.

ALF: [slowly enters kitchen] The Great Orange hunter stalks his prey.
[opens fridge] Ah, he sees it. The illusive loin of Pork the most
  prized catch in the refridgidary jungle. What's this?
[picks a note off the food and reads it] "ALF don't eat this" Why
  would I eat this?
[throws away the note] Ever so deftly the great orange hunter
  maneuvers his weapon. He strikes.
[as he does this an earthquake starts] Whoa. Has the hunter angered
  the gods? Okay, I won't eat pork.

Brian: Do you get Sesame Street where you live?
ALF: No, and frankly I don't get it here either.

Willie: Go back to the tent.
ALF: It's too dangerous out there. I had to kill a fifty-foot snake
  with my pocketknife.
Willie: There are no fifty-foot water snakes in the backyard.
ALF: I'm telling ya, it was bright green and it spit water. Ths Ths
[spitting water sound]
ALF: .
Willie: That was my new garden hose.
ALF: Oh, no wonder it was sucking on the spigot.

[the cat Lucky has died and the Tanners are having a funeral for him]
ALF: I'm reminded of a prayer he used to recite every night before
  going to bed, "And if I die before I wake, chicken-fry me like a
  steak."

[at the cat Lucky's funeral]
ALF: Where I'm from, this is ludicrous. It's like having a funeral
  for a hamburger.

ALF: Kate, have I ever lied to you?
Kate: Yes. Several times.
ALF: I meant today.

ALF: If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it's
  yours. If it's run over by a car, you don't want it.

Willie: Some people are so blinded by the thirst for money, that it
  causes them to lose their values and do things they shouldn't do.
ALF: Well, that explains Ghostbusters II.

[ALF is trying to be a professional shrink and he's annoying Kate and
  Willie]
ALF: Speaking of aggravation, we've got to do something about Brian.
Kate: What's wrong with Brian?
ALF: He's been experiencing some negative stroking from Kate lately.
Kate: [in a sudden burst of anger] All right. That's it.
Willie: Calm down.
ALF: Stop ventilating.
Kate: I am not ventilating. I am talking. [to Willie] And I resent
  the implication that I'm having a negative effect on my son's
  outlook. Oh I give up. I give up.
ALF: You're letting out your emotions. Good. Now we can make some
  real progress.
Willie: And you are spouting out a lot of psychological clichés you
  don't even understand.
ALF: Why so hostile, Willie? I'm okay. You're okay.
Willie: This must stop.
ALF: That's right. A good scream. Let it fly.
Willie: You cannot keep aggravating people like this.
ALF: Why do you hate your mother?

[ALF has just squirted Willie with a squirting flower]
Willie: You amaze me. You're 229 years old and that's what you think
  is funny.

Brian: You'll have to chew with your mouth closed tonight, ALF.
ALF: All right, but on my planet, that's considered very rude. People
  think you're hiding something.

Kate: Don't break that remote.
ALF: Kate, have I ever broken anything?
[Kate stares at him] Well, lately? [pause] This week? [pause] Today?
  [pause] Since breakfast?

ALF: We only have ten major organs, eight of which are stomachs.
Willie: I would have guessed all ten.

[ALF and Lynn are trying to get their parents to stop fighting]
ALF: To get a couple back together on Melmac, we'd recreate the
  happiest moment of their marriage.
Lynn: I wonder what Mom and Dad's happiest moment was.
ALF: The day they met me?
Lynn: Think again.
ALF: The day after they met me.
Lynn: Keep thinking.
ALF: I can't. My brain hurts.

Brian: Your name's really Gordon?
ALF: Yeah, Gordon.
Brian: That's funny.
ALF: It was my mother's maiden name, all right?

ALF: Back home on Melmac, I had a cousin, Pretty Boy Shumway. He was
  so mean, if he didn't like your looks,
[points at Willy, imitating machine gun sound]
ALF: ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.
Willie: You mean he'd shoot you if he didn't like how you looked?
ALF: No. He'd just point at you and go, "Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak."

Willie: How long are you gonna keep this up?
ALF: Well, in the words of Porky Pig "tha-tha-tha-tha-That's all
  folks." Speaking of Porky, do I smell bacon?
Willie: No.
ALF: Well, I'd like to.

[ALF is sitting on Willie's bed, and a burglar comes through the
  window]
ALF: [off-screen narrating] Then it happened. *He* came into my life.
  At first, I thought it was Santa Claus. Then it hit me, Santa
  probably wouldn't smell of cheap wine. Besides, he was beginning to
  fill his bag with things that didn't belong to him.
ALF: Can you take a little constructive criticism? What you're doing
  here is wrong.
Burglar: [examines ALF] Must be one of those talking dolls.
ALF: Oh, yeah? Ever had a talking doll rip out your voice box?

[ALF has to stay in the garage because Kate's mother is visiting]
ALF: Kate, there's no TV in here.
Kate: We'll let you use the portable TV.
ALF: The black and white one with the 1 inch screen? Good. I'll tape
  it to my eye.

ALF: And have you thought about what happens to me, when that "human
  babysitter" rummages trough my fridge?
Kate: What do you mean your fridge?
ALF: Okay its your fridge, but the fuzz in the meat door is mine.

Willie: When the babysitter is here, ALF, you are going to have to be
  in the attic.
ALF: Oh, great, prison. Why don't you just stick me in a sweatbox?
Willie: Were all making adjustments here, ALF. Your not gonna be
  there all that much...
ALF: Attica. Attica. Attica.

ALF: Mind if I showed you a trick ?
Kate: The last time you showed me a trick, it took three weeks for my
  eyebrows to grow back.
ALF: I told you not to lean in.

Lynn: You have a cousin named Blinky?
ALF: Well, we call him that because he likes to eat lightbulbs.

[Kate tries to help Jake to talk to a girl]
Kate: If it would be any help at all, you could practice on me.
Jake Ochmonek: It wouldn't be the same, Mrs. Tanner. Laura's much
  more... she's beautiful.
Kate: [coldly] I see.
[she leaves]
ALF: [to Jake] You've got a way with women.

Jake Ochmonek: Laura's very curious about her secret admirer, so I
  was thinking like actually saying something to her.
ALF: Danger, Will Robinson.

ALF: Trust me, I'll have her running trough the streets screaming
  your name. If the cops don't pick her up, she'll be yours.

[Kate refuses ALF to baby-sit Eric]
ALF: But why, why?
Kate: Why? Cause you're irresponsible. You trashed the living room,
  blew up the kitchen, wallpapered the shower...
ALF: It was a rhetorical question.

ALF: [sings to the tune of Camptown Ladies] Uncle Neal has gone away,
  doodaa doodaa. I can eat out here today, all dooday long -
  Everybody. Gone the holy day...
Willie: ALF. I really don't appreciate that at all.
ALF: Okay, so do you wanna hear how I changed the words to Helter
  Skelter?

[the Tanners talk about ALF getting to know Willie's brother]
Lynn: He's a wonderful guy, with a terrific sense of humor.
ALF: I'm not gonna marry him, if that's what you're getting at.
Willie: You're meeting my brother, it's not the Pope.
ALF: I'd rather meet the Pope. I love his hats.

ALF: I'm a cursed Melmacian, I belong to the room of the goshdarned.
Kate: Goshdarned?
ALF: Ours was a polite society.

[ALF is determined to prove the man next door is Elvis Presley]
ALF: I can be logical if I have to. The man's name is Aaron King.
  Elvis' middle name was Aaron and he was king of Rock 'n' Roll.
Willie: I'm not convinced.
ALF: OK. How about this. Hank Aaron is baseball's home run king and
  Elvis loved baseball.
Willie: ALF, you are grasping at straws.
ALF: [shouts]OK. Listen to this. Aaron Burr wanted to be King of
  America and he was from the South, just like Elvis.

Willie: You can't vote, ALF , you're not a citizen.
ALF: I'll apply for a green card.
Willie: That's only if you want a job.
ALF: Pass.
[pause] I know, I'll marry Lynn. Become a citizen, vote, then drop
  her of like a hot potato.
Willie: ALF...
ALF: Sure it will be hard on her first. She'll cry, drink a little
  too much. Join with a bongo player named Waquine.
Willie: ALF.
ALF: You'd like Waquine, he doesn't like beets.
Willie: Neither you or Waquine may marry my daughter and you may not
  vote.
ALF: Fine. I have not voice in government, Waquine will get deported,
  and they'll make him eat beets.
Willie: How many cups of coffee have you had?
ALF: Forty. Why?

Willie: If you had eaten that dish towel, I would have been very
  angry.
[pause] That's a sentence I never thought I would hear myself say.

[the Tanners help ALF becoming a minister. They are asking him
  questions from Melmac's holy book]
Brian: What's is the kindest thing that you can do for someone else?
ALF: Burp down wind.
Willie: He's right. It says, "He who burps down wind can party with
  me any time."

ALF: I don't want to be an orphan. I saw "Annie." Orphans have to eat
  gruel and tap dance with mops.

ALF: I hate musicals. Out of the blue people burst into songs.
Willie: Hence the term "musical."
ALF: Yeah, but wouldn't it get on your nerves if all of a sudden I
  started singing : "Hey, Kate, ain't it great? Hey, Willie, you look
  silly. Hey -"
Willie: It's getting on my nerves.
ALF: So what musical are you going to go see today?
Willie: "Cats."
ALF: Take me, please! Then afterwards, we can go backstage and eat
  the actors!

Willie: This is a jigsaw puzzle.
ALF: It's broken.
Willie: That's the object, ALF. You're supposed to put it together.
ALF: Why? I didn't break it.

ALF: All right. Let me see if I've got this reindeer thing straight.
  There's... uh... there's Dasher, Dancer, Comet, Cupid... Matthew,
  Mark, Luke and John.
Lynn: No, it's Prancer, Dancer, Vixen, Blitzen...
ALF: Huey, Duey and Luey.
Brian: No, those are ducks.
ALF: Then how do they pull the sleigh?

ALF: Oh, by the way, don't bother looking for your laxative on a
  rope.
Willie: Oh, you mean my soap on a rope?
ALF: Trust me on this one.

ALF: I can see you're still one sandwich short of a picnic.

ALF: Once we add sound, color and stick Eddie Murphy in there
  somewhere, it'll be a smash.

ALF: Hey, you. Get offa my cloud.

ALF: Raining cats? You open the skylight and I'll get the relish.

ALF: Hey, Willie. Let's throw a cat on the barbie.

ALF: The only good cat is a stir-fried cat.

Dorothy: You don't have to make rude noises.
ALF: That's okay. I don't mind.

ALF: A ceremony doesn't have to be long to be effective. A Melmacian
  wedding contains a priest saying "You're hitched, go for it, babe."

Jake Ochmonek: Why do we have to wear meat at this ceremony anyway?
ALF: 'Cause the high priest on Melmac was also the butcher.

Willie: I never meant to bring Jimbo over.
ALF: You brought an elephant home to dinner?
Willie: I said Jimbo, not Jumbo.

Jake Ochmonek: What are you, anyway?
ALF: I'm an alien, from the planet Melmac. I have powers you can only
  dream of.
Jake Ochmonek: Like what?
ALF: Uhhhm... I can watch 10 hours of TV, without ever getting up to
  go to the bathroom.

ALF: I'm on a new diet. I can eat as much of whatever I want.
Lynn: And you lose weight that way?
ALF: You do?

ALF: Justice will not rest.
Kate: What if I gave justice a cookie?
ALF: Justice will think about it.

Kate: ALF, you can use the portable TV in the bedroom.
ALF: But it's too small. It makes everyone look like Danny DeVito.

Kate: Do you remember when you thought Mr.Littwak was building an
  atomic bomb in his basement?
ALF: It was an atomic bomb.
Willie: It was a pool heather.
ALF: Hah. The Littwak's don't even own a pool.
Kate: Yes, they do.
ALF: They do? Can we go over?

ALF: Carl Jung was a big weenyhead.

ALF: [ALF is trying to hypnotize Lucky] You are getting sleepy.
  You... are no longer a cat. You are a bagel.

[ALF has just broken Willie's shortwave radio]
Willie: Do you know how long - *looooooong*... It took me ten years
  to put that thing together.
ALF: I'm glad to see you haven't wasted your life.

[Willie and Kate are debating on whether or not they should tell
  Kate's mother about ALF]
Willie: I suppose we just sit her down and ask her if she's ever seen
  E.T.?
ALF: Why do you keep comparing me to E.T.? You know, Willie, someday,
  when people ask me what you're like, I'll ask them "Did you ever
  see 'The Nutty Professor'?"

Willie: There's more than one way to skin a cat.
ALF: You've been looking at my recipe book.

ALF: Are you gonna throw a hissy fit every time I squander a couple
  thousand dollars?

Kate: Where's Lizard taking you?
Lynn: To a science fiction movie. Something about this guy being
  shrunk and then injected into someone else.
ALF: That's not science fiction. A friend of mine did that once. He
  took a wrong turn and got stuck in a guy's nose.

ALF: Melmac was the name of my planet. It's also what it was made out
  of.

Willie: Well, ALF, while we're gone, I trust you won't be getting
  into any mischief.
ALF: You do?
Willie: Not really, but we gotta go.

Willie: Isn't there anybody else you could bother?
ALF: We voted. You were the people's choice.

[ALF and Lynn are preparing a surprise dinner for Kate and Willie]
ALF: I just need to finish spit-shining these plates here.
Lynn: [grabbing the plates] That won't be necessary.
ALF: Fine, let them eat off dirty dishes.

[ALF enters the Tanner's bedroom]
ALF: Are you decent?
Willie: Does it matter?
ALF: Not to me.

ALF: Like my old skeelball coach used to say: "Find something you're
  not good at, and then don't do it."

Willie: [to Kate about ALF] He's odd. Even for an alien.

Willie: I'm gonna have my hamburger medium.
ALF: Medium? They are all the same size. Extra large.

Trevor Ochmonek: Hey, Willie! Could we borrow some of your tools?
Willie: Sure. They're in your garage.

Willie: You know, Trevor. It seems this young man is a little Mister
  Fix-it.
Lynn: Little Mister Fix-it. How cute.
Jake Ochmonek: You want me, don't you?

ALF: [picking up Willie's glasses] Yeah, what is it about this Lash
  that you don't like?
Willie: Lash? How do you know about Lash?
ALF: Well, Lynn and I were talking last night and she seems to
  feel...
[tries on Willie's glasses]... Geez, you're blind as a bat, aren't
  you?

[the Tanners are preparing for a garage sale]
ALF: How about this? A genuine, Melmacian, survival knife.
Brian: There's no blade.
ALF: Well, life on Melmac wasn't that tough.

ALF: Tell me, which side of the earth does this nose come from? Ha!

ALF: It's the day before Christmas, I've hidden all the eggs.
Willie: ALF, we hide eggs at Easter, not at Christmas.
ALF: Oh, that's right. Christmas is where we carve the pumpkin.

Lynn: Oh, Alf. What are we gonna do with you?
ALF: I guess you'll have to love me as long as it lasts.
Lynn: We will.

Willie: I'm trying to make this vacation more fun. You might do it
  yourself instead of complaining all the time.

[on a camping trip]
Willie: One more word out of you, and you're not eating with us.
ALF: Right. Let the alien starve.
Willie: I think the alien could skip a meal. It might be a new
  experience for you!
[pause]
Willie: How would you like your hamburger?
ALF: Medium rare. Hold the lightning.
Willie: How would you like to be 50% hair?
ALF: You know, you're a different person when you're on vacation.
Willie: I'm just trying to make this vacation fun.
ALF: How, by drowning us?
Willie: By trying to keep a positive attitude! You might do that
  yourself... INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING ALL THE TIME!
Kate: [annoyed] Guys, please.
ALF: Well, not everyone enjoys spending their vacation in a
  rainforest!
Willie: We're in this rainforest because of you!
ALF: I vote we go home.
Willie: You're not voting in this.
ALF: Call the newspapers! Democracy is dead!

[about ALF's "car"]
Lynn: What's that thing?
ALF: It's not a thing. It's an ALF Romeo.

ALF: Who said I'm gonna walk? I'm gonna drive my new Mercedes. What
  do you say? Burgundy with the tan interior.

ALF: [ALF blows up the kitchen] I guess we'll have to order in.

ALF: How can I read with all this quiet?

ALF: [ALF almost kills Willie with the TV] Willie, it was an
  accident!
Willie: An accident? An accident? You almost killed me, and you say
  it was an accident?
ALF: Alright, let's call it a mistake!

ALF: Uh, can I make a suggestion? Hello, read my lips.

ALF: Opens curtains "I decided to go outside and wait for the pizza,
  big mistake" Window falls on his head, then his fingers, then ALF
  falls out the window.

ALF: Hey, what's going on in here?
Willie: We're having a family meeting.
ALF: Oh I get it, freeze out the alien. I guess I'm not part of the
  family.
Kate: Uh ALF, we thought you were watching The 3 Stooges.
ALF: I turned it off. Somehow I just can't buy Shemp as a surgeon.
Brian: Curly was a senator once.
ALF: True, and Moe was Speaker of the House.
Willie: Could we put an end to the Stooge talk here for a minute?
ALF: Sootaintly, whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo, ha ha ha.

ALF: Yo Kate, where do you keep your casserole dishes?
Kate: Why?
ALF: The cat won't fit in the toaster. Never mind, I'll make a peanut
  butter sandwich, where's the blender?
Kate: Try it without the blender this time, and don't get hair in the
  peanut butter jar.
ALF: Rules rules rules.
ALF: Grease fire grease fire.
ALF: Never mind the curtains put me out.

ALF: That's it. I say we fight violence with violence. That's how we
  used to solve things back home.
Willie: But ALF, don't you remember what happened to your planet?
ALF: Well, it blew up in a nuclear holocaust. Why?
Willie: Don't you see the connection?
ALF: [pause] What connection?
Willie: I give up.
ALF: Me too. I'm gonna lay down. My head is spinning. Maybe a cold
  cream sundae.

Lynn: [giving ALF a haircut] ALF, hold still. I want to get it even.
ALF: Well, don't cut it too short. It'll look like I have a big
  schnoz.
Kate: I didn't realize you were so concerned with your appearance.
ALF: You think I wake up looking this good?
Kate: [doorbell rings] Doorbell.
ALF: Hide in the kitchen, ALF. Hah! Beat ya to it.
Lynn: Ahem. Two dollars, ALF. Pay up.
ALF: Two dollars? I didn't even get my medicure.
Lynn: Welcher!

Jake Ochmonek: Can't I stay with the Tanners? I'm allergic to Kitch.
Lynn: Go, enjoy. Drink the water. Adios!

Kate: What are you doing?
ALF: [with a sunlamp in front of his head] Oh, soaking up rays, Babe.
  Your sunlamp's not working. I've been sitting here for five hours,
  Nada.
Kate: Five hours? ALF, you're lucky you didn't get a sunburn.
ALF: [Kate touches him] Aaah!
Kate: Sorry.
ALF: Aah, oh, it hurts, it hurts.
Kate: Well, would you like some cold cream?
ALF: Yeah, but just one scoop, I'm on a diet.
Kate: It's for your nose.
ALF: That's where I'm trying to lose the weight.
Kate: ALF, I'm talking about cold cream. Not ice cream. Cold cream.
  You understand?
ALF: You're talking like they're two different things.
Kate: They *are*! Haven't you been listening?
ALF: What is this, healing through hollering?


# "ALF" (1986) {A.L.F. (#1.1)}
[sound of cans opening, Alf and Brian come out with two cans of
  something in their hand]
Kate: I said no soda pop.
Brian: It's not soda pop, it's beer.
Gordon 'ALF' Shumway: [burps] You're about out of Coors!

ALF: Why must you needlessly complicate everything?

Kate Tanner: [after ALF claims that according to a magazine article,
  he is a thrill-seeker] This from the same person who watched the
  movie Aliens from under the couch?
ALF: Hey, I thought I owed one of those guys money.


# "ALF" (1986) {Prime Time (#2.5)}
Willie Tanner: Let me just try to understand, ALF. [sic] The
  operative word in People Log is "people"... one of which you are...
  not... one.
ALF: That's cruel. Not to mention poorly constructed from a
  grammatical standpoint.


# "ALF" (1986) {Someone to Watch Over Me: Part 2 (#2.18)}

'ALF': I don't know, what color is it? Ha! I kill me.
Brian Tanner: Ha! You kill me.

Willie Tanner: ALF why are you answering the phone?
'ALF': I live here.
Willie Tanner: I called to speak to Mrs Ochmonek
'ALF': Hold on, I'll get her.
Willie Tanner: I'll call back.
'ALF': Your dime.
[ The phone rings again, as Mrs Ochmonek approaches the phone, it
  steps]
Willie Tanner: Why do you keep answering the phone?
'ALF': You keep calling
Willie Tanner: Where's Mrs Ochmonek?
'ALF': I don't know, the last time I saw her, she was stealing my
  pizza oh and don't worry about the cat.
Willie Tanner: Why? What happened to lucky?
Willie Tanner: I might've stepped on him when I opened the fridge
  door.
Willie Tanner: You were in the kitchen?
'ALF': I had to break in through the back door after I fell out the
  window.
Willie Tanner: Where are you, what are you doing?
'ALF': I'm in the bedroom wearing a blue dress.
Willie Tanner: Don't go anywhere
'ALF': Where would I go? I'm not wearing the right shoes
Willie Tanner: [ Hangs up] I should've locked him in the garage! [ To
  a fellow social worker] Kids

# "ALF's Hit Talk Show" (2004)
Drew Carey: Yeah, I, uh, had heart surgery a couple years ago. People
  always ask me about it.
Alf: Yep.
Drew Carey: I had angioplasty and a stent. Uh, same thing Dick Cheney
  had, except they left my heart in.


# "Aaagh! It's the Mr. Hell Show!" (2000)
Mr. Hell: Being red with pointy ears doesn't make me a devil, being a
  bastard does!

Tough Cop: Shoot first, ask questions later. Maybe at the funeral.

Mr. Hell: I'd like to introduce you to my lovely co-host, whose name
  I can't remember since I had sex with her and no longer care.

Mr. Hell: It takes 9 months to make one episode of The Simpsons?
  We're doing a whole series in that time... but it's still good!

Damien: Father I don't really see the point of trying to enroll in an
  all girls school
Mr. Hell: Are you sure you're my son?

[Victorian lady detective accidentally exposed her ankle]
Man: [throwing rock at her] Ankle slut!

[Serge has just finished his career as a porn star]
Serge: Come on Lucky, let's go get laid!
[Lucky squeaks]
Serge: Okay, okay give a guy time to adjust

[after Serge tries to shoot Lucky's new girlfriend, Lucky shoves her
  out of the way but she gets run over by a truck in the road]
Serge: I know if I get a girlfriend you can kill her, okay?

Mr. Hell: [doorbell rings] Oooooooh that must be the pizza boy!
  [opens door while getting baseball bat ready]

Mr. Hell: [seeing his half-devil half-angel son Damien at the door,
  he looks at the screen] It was a holiday thing.

Mr. Hell: This show is the last in the series, unless they're showing
  them in the wrong order, in which case see you next week.


# "Aaahh!!! Real Monsters" (1994)
[Krumm's hair disappears]
Ickis: Hey, Krumm, I think you're having a bad hair day.

Oblina: What is that noise?
Krumm: Maybe it's my stomach.
Oblina: Even your stomach is not that loud, Krumm.

Ickis: [refering to the blob] And when he looks at us that way, you
  know he's thinking... breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Krumm: I wanna be dinner.

Security Guard: Hey! No running in the mall! Darn dogs.

Ickis: All those stories he told were really great, are they all
  true?
The Gromble: Of course they were all true, great monters never lie.
Ickis: Even the one about the shoe store?
The Gromble: No!
Ickis: But you just said [The Gromble glares. Ickis laughs nervously]
  Well, maybe he, exaggerated a little...

Ickis: [seeing fireworks] Wow, instant sky flowers. Boy, are they
  noisy!

Helix: [Aaron and STAN have been captured and are taken to the
  genetics lab. Helix is peering into a microscpoe. He looks up and
  faces Aaron] A teenager? That's the best Hall can do?
Charlie Landers: Yeah, it is kind of unfair to you old guys.
Helix: [chuckles] Though I must admit you have proven yourself a very
  impressive opponent. Too bad you're working for that fool, Hall.
Charlie Landers: He's not a fool.
Helix: Even his own people are willing to sell him out. How you think
  we knew about you, hmm? You should come and work for us.
Charlie Landers: No way. I will never help the Omega Defiance. No
  matter what you do to me.
Helix: You'd be surprised what I can do to you. You met my creatures
  in the forest. Imagine what you'll look like with a tail of
  crocodile or head of the dog or a snout of pig, or all three of
  them! What your family will think of you then?
Charlie Landers: I think they'd make me sleep outside.

Hall: [Aaron and Emma have been hauled on the carpet for disobeying
  orders] Your irresponsible actions nearly ended in disaster. And
  they cost me an SSJ [supersonic jet] .
Charlie Landers: I'll pay for a new one.
Hall: They cost 1.7 billion dollars. [pauses] Apiece.

  important.

Sasshi: I don't know if I'm supposed to be happy or scared, I'm so
  confused!

Arumi Asahina, Sasshi: All things extant in this world, Gods of

# "Absolute Power" (2003)
Simon Wellington: It's very simple. I was looking for a fox.
Colin Priestley: Right. Jesus. It's our own fault. We train you guys
  to talk bollocks in the House of Commons and the television studio,
  but please spare me the dispatch box stare. I'm not Leader of the
  Opposition. I'm an intelligent man.
Simon Wellington: A fox. Really. There are foxes on the heath. It's
  quite a sight. I like to go there after doing my red boxes.
Colin Priestley: Simon. Simon. As the Prime Minister's Press
  Secretary, you take more confessions than a priest, so I've heard
  the best lies in the business and yours is the political equivalent
  of "the dog ate my homework".
Simon Wellington: If I were making up a cover story, I'd make up
  something less ridiculous than this.
Colin Priestley: You had scratches and torn clothing.
Simon Wellington: I was mugged. Regrettably, these two men stopped to
  help me. That's how the story got out. Where's the selfish,
  uncaring society when you need it?
Colin Priestley: Simon, do me and yourself a favour. You're gay. It's
  what we call a "moma".
Simon Wellington: I'm sorry?
Colin Priestley: Moment of madness. That one's a bit inky. Have to
  think of a new one for your press release. Minute of misjudgement.
  Flash of... Well, maybe not flash, but whatever.
Simon Wellington: Look, call me a leaker, call me a plotter, call me
  anti-European, but I'm not gay.
Colin Priestley: Simon, you probably think that being gay is the
  wrong answer, which is why you're lying, but it's the right answer.
  The PM's got most of the country now, but even after a couple of
  gay Cabinet ministers the pink flag doesn't exactly flap for him.So
  we're going to appoint a minister for fudge packers and muff divers
  - as the electorate will learn to stop calling them - except we
  can't find a gay minister.
Simon Wellington: Well, what about...
Colin Priestley: Mandelson won't take it. Said something about
  stereotyping. But then look what the fox dragged in.
Simon Wellington: I'm not gay.
Colin Priestley: Simon, you have 48 hours to decide. "Out and proud"
  is the press release I'm planning. If you're out, you're in, and if
  you're in, you're out.

Charles Prentiss: Now. So... er... paintings... in the style of John
  Sell Cotman, Tom Girtin, Turner... The great tradition of English
  watercolourists and by extension, therefore, your enemy is...
  painters who prefer to use acrylics? Um... help me out. Um...
  right. "A.H." They're all signed A.H. Er... That would be Alice?
  Agatha? Give me a clue.
Martin McCabe: Adolf Hitler.
Lord Harcourt: The Commandant's desk from Auschwitz. His chair. This
  key once unlocked the main gate at Belsen. And over here, and this
  is particularly recherche, a little canister, unused, marked
  "Zyklon".
Martin McCabe: Could you spare us a moment, please?
Roddy Growse: Oh, yes, of course. It is a bit overwhelming. Take your
  time.
Martin McCabe: God forgive me, Charles. We've got to get out of here.
  This is quite impossible.
Charles Prentiss: Nothing's impossible, Martin, if we've set our mind
  to it. We don't falter.
Martin McCabe: What?
Charles Prentiss: When Edwina revealed so vividly to us that she was
  actually a man, did we hesitate in promoting her memoir?
Martin McCabe: Charles, we need to get you back to London.
Charles Prentiss: If I want your opinion, Martin, I'll give it to me.
  No. We took the client. We're not about to ditch the client because
  things have got a bit eggy.
Martin McCabe: A bit eggy? Charles, they're fucking Nazis.
Charles Prentiss: That's the ultimate PR challenge, isn't it? Decades
  of terrible press, but what did they actually achieve?
Charles Prentiss: Apart from the slaughter of millions of Jews? I
  can't believe I'm hearing this! You cannot spin the Final Solution.
Charles Prentiss: They gave us Gewurztraminer, Riefenstahl, the
  Autobahn, the Volkswagen, the iconic use of dark leathers and they
  made the sausages run on time.
Martin McCabe: You cannot spin the Holocaust.
Charles Prentiss: Well, 20 years ago you couldn't pay people to have
  an Alsatian. Devil dogs. Then rebrand them as German Shepherds -
  German - and suddenly, bingo, they're top of the poochy pops. You
  don't have to "buy" the video, you can "own" it. See? All in a
  word.
Martin McCabe: Poochy pops?
Charles Prentiss: Above all, Martin, think of the money. The money's
  going to be bloody outrageous.
Lord Harcourt: [leaving the basement] The Hebrew - it's always him.
  2,000 years and nothing's changed.
Charles Prentiss: Yes. I've never really understood this thing about
  the Jews, why they're such a menace. They look and behave just like
  us.
Lord Harcourt: Exactly.
Martin McCabe: I'm a Jew. [all look at him menacingly]
Charles Prentiss: [getting in their car] Never, never, never let us
  do anything like that, Martin, ever again.

Colin Priestley: [about the Democrabus] He loves it.
Charles Prentiss: What?
Colin Priestley: It's quintessentially British, it has tradition, it
  has flair, it has...
Charles Prentiss: ...wheels.
Colin Priestley: Yes. It's also got democracy. It's modern.
Charles Prentiss: It's a bus.
Colin Priestley: It's in tune with the people, it's blue-skies
  thinking. It reminds one of childhood, of day trips, of the
  seaside. It's radical but rooted.
Charles Prentiss: He wants it?
Colin Priestley: He wants the whole package. This'll get rid of the
  old bastards once and for all, spending the rest of their lives in
  some travelling, never-ending Radio Five Live phone-in. It'll look
  like sweeping reform, but the beauty of it is that essentially it's
  totally meaningless.
Charles Prentiss: It's certainly that.
Colin Priestley: It's a pity we can't acknowledge your part in all of
  this, Charles. It seems so unfair that I get all the credit. Still,
  who knows? I might be able to swing it with the PM for you to get a
  seat in the Lords. Which would you prefer, top or bottom deck?


# "Absolute Power" (2003) {The House of Lords (#2.6)}
Colin Priestley: [to Charles, about taking all the credit for
  Prentiss-McCabe's Democrabus idea] Maybe I'll be able to swing it

  prefer, top or bottom deck?


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992)
Eddie: What do you think of the kitchen, Pats?
Patsy: I think it's fabulous.
Saffie: It isn't done yet.
Eddie: No, sweetie. Maybe she's right. Maybe this IS fabulous.

Eddie: Patsy hasn't eaten since 1974.
Patsy: A crisp, darling. A crisp.

Eddie: [in front of Saffy] Ooo, she's so cold, sweetie! I'll just bet
  she has her period in cubes.

Bubble: Ooo... Bear with me, see, I am HOPELESS with names, faces and
  people.

Eddie: Look at me Sweetheart, huh, huh? One day you'll turn into me!
Gran: [sweetly] And you will turn into me, dear.

Bubble: Don't ask me. I for sure *don't* know.

Eddie: But darling, that dress was awful! How did you manage to get
  her to wear it?
Patsy: Oh, I just told her a cock-and-bull story about how I was a
  slave to my mother in her dying years and how I always strived to
  make her like me and she never loved me at all, ha!
Eddie: Ooh!... [reflects for a second] But Pats, sweetie... That is
  all *true*. Your mother never loved you at all.
Patsy: DAMN!

Eddie: Where's my thing? You know, my thing... my vibrating thing...
Patsy: Right by your bedside drawer, darling.
Eddie: Not THAT, not THAT!... My beeper, my beeper!
Patsy: Oh. [fishes inside her skirt] Here.
Eddie: [disgusted] Keep it. I don't want it now. Don't WANT it now.

Eddie: [to Saffy] Oh, darling, Mummy loves you. On the day you were
  born I *knew* I wanted you...
Patsy: However, the day after...

Saffie: I am getting married.
Bo: [delighted] Hallellujah! Praise the Lord! Let's speak in tongues
  - boolooloolooloolooloo!

Eddie: Is champas all right with you Pats?
Patsy: Lovely darling.
Eddie: Should we finish off the beluga or should we have some smoked
  salmon nibbly things?
Patsy: Oh whatever sweetie.
Eddie: All right, we'll finish off the beluga.

Eddie: La Croix sweetie, La Croix.

Eddie: Get ready for this sweetie

Patsy: It's fabulous darling.

Eddie: Let the music lift you up, sweetie.

Eddie: Bloody Pet Shop Boys, sweetie.

Eddie: [ shouting] I DON'T WANT MORE CHOICE, I JUST WANT NICER THINGS
  .

[Edina has lost her speech which she has to present to the PR
  meeting]
Eddie: Yeah I was gonna' make a- [taps microphone] Testing. Testing.
  -Yeah I was gonna' make a speech, but I just can't be bothered
  anymore. I mean, this used to be like fun you know; yeah it used to
  be fun, but I'm getting bored of all the 'fun' bits now. You know,
  your endless bloody lunches and launches, you know, no-career
  celebrities and party desperates. And what for, huh? Some colony of
  crap tags and mags! Well I'm sorry there has to be a little more
  than that doesn't there? [slams her handbag down] Hmmm? You know I
  had a speech, you know, my... my
  integrated-projected-global-tele-network system bloody
  system-system. But you know, if that's what the worlds coming to I
  don't want to be in it. No I don't want that. I don't want to be in
  some sort of cyber-space-hypervirtual bloody reality. I don't want
  that- exchanging e-mails with some old age bloody hippies with more
  information at their fingertips than is safe to know about. I don't
  want that! What kind of reality is that, huh, you know, with a
  thirteen-amp plug on the end of it? Huh? Huh?... That can be
  un-plugged like that? Come-on I'm going. [She turns to leave,
  but... ] No I'm not going yet! No, you! [points to her competition,
  Claudia Bing] You, you, just sit there like your velcroed to some
  bloody add-man! You know those crap-head add-men over there, you
  know, those kings of bastardization that have just taken everything
  that was ever real and genuine and honest and original and attached
  it to a toilet cleaner! Whereas I, I... Like a bird on a wire...
  Like a drunk in a midnight choir... I have tried in my way to be
  free. [Then she sings] Like a bird, on a wire.
Patsy: Go for it Eddy.
Eddie: [singing]... Like a drunk in a midnight choir. I have tried in
  my way to be free. [Claudia Bing and her colleagues are laughing]
  Yeah you can laugh, but you know something- I don't want more
  choice I just want nicer things! And you, you can take that look
  off your face, sitting there with your... with your wheels and AIDS
  and starvation. You know, skimming a neat profit of the whole of
  human misery. Labeling us all with this- with this global guilt.
  Well it may not be all great and good but it ain't that bad, so
  cheer up world it may never bloody happen! [slams her bag down
  again] Come on I'm going. [Edina walks off making rude farting
  sounds at everyone in the room]

Patsy: Easy going sex with gorgeous, underage youths...
Eddie: Yeaaah.

Eddie: Pats...
Patsy: Yes, Eddy?
Eddie: You have no morals, darling.

Eddie: I want total sensory deprivation and back-up drugs.

Saffie: I'm sorry, mum, but I've never seen what it is that you
  actually do.
Eddie: PRrr.
Saffie: Yes, but...
Eddie: PR. I PR things. People. Places. Concepts...
Patsy: ...Lulu.
Eddie: Lulu... I make the fabulous... I make the crap into credible.
  I make the dull into...
Patsy: ...Delicious.

[on the significance of awards]
Eddie: They don't matter, do they, darling?... Awards, Pats?
Patsy: Oh, Eddy. We've been here before.
Eddie: It's just... you know... I WANT one. I don't just want one,
  darling, I NEED one. My career is on a toboggan run of failure at
  the moment... I just need one. It's the only thing that seems to
  mean ANYthing these days... I need one now before the menopause
  drags me into her gaping jaws. Before my creative hormonal oil-well
  dribbles to a halt. Before my bottom becomes just a patch-work
  quilt of monkey glands, darling.
Saffie: But, Mom, menopause can be a very exhilarating and positive
  experience for a woman.
Eddie: Oooh, yes. And the curse is a blessing and childbirth is
  painless. No. Unless that gaping hole on my mantle piece is filled
  pretty soon, darling, I might as well... I might as well lick this
  light-switch and do us all a favour, darling...

Patsy: [to Saffy] You piece of filth!

Eddie: I have been a paradise, but I've never been a me.

[to daughter Saffron]
Eddie: With any luck we'd get Roman Polanski interested in you.
Patsy: She was never young enough for him.

Saffie: I didn't know you still had the shop.
Eddie: Oh, still got it, darling, but it's not doing very well. The
  supply's dropped off. You know... India's: had it, been there...
  Africa's dried up completely now... It's ridiculous... Thank God
  for Grozny. Honestly. Well, darling, if it wasn't for that lovely
  little Russian army advancing, thrashing out all those gorgeous
  little heirlooms in my direction, I don't know what I'd do... Oh,
  you should see, darling, in the shop I've got at the moment this
  fabulous little samovar with a little old woman still attached to
  it, sweetie. Clinging on for dear life. Having to lure her off with
  dry bread crumbs so that I could get a decent price...

[Eddy comes into the kitchen to find her mother making a cake]
Eddie: What? This is all my stuff you're using?
Gran: What, dear?
Eddie: All this. This wheat powder... what's... This.
Gran: Flour, dear?
Eddie: Flour. Yes. All this is mine, is it? I mean, I am now paying
  for old people to eat cake.

Patsy: Take a holiday, darling. South of France.
Magda: I don't do holidays. Everybody's a nobody in a bikini.

Eddie: What do you see when you look in the mirror, darling?
Patsy: Me looking fabulous. What do you see?
Eddie: Yeah... Just the room.

Eddie: Pats. Pats. You know, like, when you are in a room or
  something, and you think someone is like staring at you...
Patsy: In a room?
Eddie: Or in a plane. Anywhere... anywhere... And you are sort of
  doing things because you think someone is looking at you like
  people are looking at you, you know?
Patsy: On a plane?
Eddie: Well, anywhere... anywhere... And then you look at them and
  they are just sort of asleep but their head is flopped in your
  direction, you know? Well, I don't want THAT to happen. I don't
  want THAT to be my life, you know. The whole world asleep.

Eddie: The word on the old grave marker, the words on your grave
  marker. What is that?
Patsy: Oh, your epitomb.
Eddie: Your epitomb. What is that you want on your epitomb?
Patsy: I want: "She was fantastic."..."Patsy was here."
Eddie: No, daring, you can just have "Patsy Stone".
Patsy: Oh, Eddy, Eddy. Wait for this. Wait for this: "Eddy: Still no
  thinner."
Eddie: These are really funny. We could sell those.

[Saffron is living "on campus" and Eddy tells her she wants her to
  move back home]
Saffie: Mum, what is the problem? I have my life and you have yours.
  This is what you wanted.
Eddie: I feel orphaned, you know.
Saffie: What is the matter? Has the deal fallen through?
Eddie: No the deal. Not the deal. Not that. It's just...
Saffie: What?
Eddie: Well, darling, you have just sort of abandoned me in this sort
  of wilderness of potential greatness and fabulousness, haven't you?
  All my walls have gone "flop", "flop"... I'm just like this kind of
  prisoner that's released... RELEASED PRISONER, darling, that is
  walking out into the squinting sun. I mean, you've cast me adrift
  with no oars.
Saffie: You have oars.
Eddie: I haven't.
Saffie: You have. You're just too lazy and fat to use them.

Eddie: All right, time for another little drinkie before we go?
Saffie: Where are you going?
Eddie: New York.
Saffie: I didn't think they let people with convictions in.
Eddie: Darling, its not a conviction.
Patsy: Just a firm belief.
Eddie: Yes.

Patsy: I'm not happy!

Sarah: Does your mother know you write plays and things?
Saffie: No, and I don't want her to either, so don't say anything.
Sarah: Oh, you don't need to worry. I don't speak to her anymore. Not
  since she gave me that chemical peel.
Saffie: Well, it wasn't so much chemical. And not so much peel. She
  set fire to your pig-tails.
Sarah: It's good job I'm thick-skinned... Well, except for the
  shoulder.

Saffie: My life just flashed before my eyes.
Eddie: What was it like? A Bergman film without the jokes?

Eddie: Had two husbands, one was too short one was gay. Still sweetie
  if you want to know how to peck a dwarf on the cheek as he's
  walking out of the house to the disco in your dress , then I'm your
  girl.

Patsy: I thought a little mosey down Bond Street, a little sniff
  around Gucci, sidle up to Ralph Lauren, pass through Browns and on
  to Quags for a light lunch.

Eddie: I did tell you the facts of life didn't I sweetie?
Saffie: If you mean that time you sat on my bed and shook me awake at
  two in the morning, stoned out of your brain, and slurred into my
  ear 'By the way sweetie, people have it off,' then yes, you told me
  the facts of life.

Eddie: Sweetie what are you drinking?
Patsy: Oh this? Chanel No. 5.

Patsy: They want you filleted and splayed on the butcher's block so
  they can photograph all your organs for "Heat" magazine.

Patsy: I can get you a man.
Eddie: Well, how?
Patsy: Pay.

Patsy: [to Saffy] Oh you little BITCH TROLL FROM HELL.

Patsy: [to Saffy] Miserable little turnip.

Eddie: Family? Family? God, I hope you're not inviting that bloody,
  bollocky, selfish, two-faced, chicken, bastard, pig-dog man are
  you?

Bubble: I turned on the, ah, watchamacallit this morning. I want to
  say telephone. No, that's not right. You look at it.
Eddie: Television?
Bubble: That's it.

Patsy: One whiff of a cocoa bean and our customers would fly like
  vampires before garlic. Jeremy's must remain a sterile oasis, free
  from street eaters and coffee carriers. Aseptic and razor-sharp as
  our customers hipbones. These women shop for lunch! labels are
  their only sustenance! Their skeleton legs in Manolos have worn
  trenches down the pavement of Sloane Street. Their arm sinews have
  just enough muscles left in their arm to lift up a credit card.

Eddie: Mother, are you still on the computer?
Gran: Yes, dear. Sometimes you get into a porn loop and just can't
  get out.

Saffie: [commenting on Patsy's new Botox look] You look like a haggis
  with pointed toes. A tight old bladder skin holding together some
  rotting offal.

Eddie: I thought I told you to buy a laptop.
Bubble: A lap... top? Top? [opens her bag and reveals a small lap
  dog]
Eddie: Get rid of it.
Bubble: Oh! But I've grown so fond! And it's SO cute. And... it's not
  just for life! It's for Christmas!

Gran: Talking to yourself dear? That's the first sign of madness, you
  know.
Eddie: Really? I thought it was talking to you.

Patsy: Pretty big tits.

Bubble: Black matter is dragging us all towards eternal dalmatian...
  And before long we will all be cloned and turned into sheep. So, to
  avoid this fate, I am being picked up by a spaceship that is hidden
  in the tail of an approaching comet. [doorbell rings] That'll be
  them buzzing now.

Patsy: [about Edina's cell phone ringing] Oh, Eddie... is it... Is it
  a bee?

Eddie: In this body there is a thin person dying to get out.
Gran: Just the one dear?


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Birth (#2.6)}
Patsy: [to Saffie] Oh, you little bitch troll from hell! You mean,
  ungrateful, little bit of dirt! You think you've had it so hard. I
  never had the things you had when I was born.
Saffron: Oh, here we go.
Patsy: I never had friends or parties or presents. Ya know? The first
  few years of my life I was just locked in a room!

Patsy: [to Saffie] I resent you!
Edina: [Trying to calm Patsy] No you don't.
Patsy: Yes I do. I hate you! Just when my life hit a good patch,
  along you came, you miserable piece of flesh. You should've ended
  up in the dust bin! The incinerator was too good for you! You know,
  when I heard that Eddie was pregnant, I told her to abort! ABORT,
  ABORT, ABORT! I said "Chuck it down the pan!". I said "Bring me..."
Saffron: [Interrupting] A knitting needle?
Patsy: [Fiercely] A knitting needle!
Saffron: [Saffie slaps Patsy's face]

Patsy: My mother didn't give birth. She had something removed!


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Birthday (#1.5)}
[At Edina's 40th birthday party]
Oliver: I think we should leave. I see no point in celebrating the
  fact that she's lived so BLOODY LONG.

Eddie: So, Marsh. Where's my pres.?
Marshall: Sweetheart...
Bo: I have the gift. Oh, many more.
Eddie: What the buggery bollocks is this?
Bo: It's a copy - it's a signed copy - of my book on ancient oils.
Eddie: [flinging it behind her shoulder] Next!

Eddie: [on turning 40] This is something that is happening to me.
  This is something that I've got to deal with, alright. I'm sorry if
  that sounds selfish, but it's me, me, me!

Eddie: Do you think we ought to get some hormone replacement packs in
  for emergencies? Do you think so, darling? I mean, one day,
  sweetie, you could come home and find me just a little toothless
  old wad of gum on the floor. You'd have to slap some glands on me,
  quick. I'll get some.

[first lines]
Saffron: Morning.
Eddie: Hello death, hello oblivion. What time is it, darling?
Saffron: Ten.
Eddie: Oh, God, I'd better be off.

Eddie: If my mother hadn't uncrossed her legs, I could be two weeks
  younger.

Eddie: No! No, no, no darling! I will not have a surprise. I will not
  have a surprise party. If it's going to be a surprise, I want to
  know about it, alright! Because I want to decide when I'm going to
  come and what I'm going to wear if I do come, alright? You can't
  expect me to go to any old bloody party, darling.

Saffron: Look, I didn't know what you'd want, so I invited a few
  people round for family lunch.
Eddie: Family? What are you calling family, darling? We're hardly the
  bloody Waltons, are we. Not just you and my mother, I hope. Is it?
Saffron: Look, will you stop behaving like this, please?
Eddie: Darling, this is how I behave. Anyway, I'm allowed to behave
  however I want on my birthday. House rule, remember, sweetie? Hmm?
  Especially to someone who didn't even think I might like a
  champagne breakfast. Not even a bloody cup of tea to wake up to on
  my birthday, no that would be asking too much, wouldn't it?

Eddie: Oh, sweetie, sweetie... Oooh, sweetie, darling... Darling,
  they're gorgeous. Where did you get them, sweetie? Hmm? Was it
  Harvey Nichols, darling?
Saffron: Yes.
Eddie: Well, you should tell me. I can get a discount there, sweetie.
Saffron: I'm glad you like them.
Eddie: Well, darling, they're hardly the ill-judged tat you normally
  give me. I mean, Lacroix, darling... They are Lacroix, aren't they,
  darling? They're not just something you put in the box, are they,
  sweetie?
Saffron: Do you like them or not?
Eddie: I like them if they're Lacroix.
Saffron: Well they are.
Eddie: Oh, good. I like them, darling.

Eddie: Oh, sweetie, oh, darling. Can you help me, sweetie, darling?
  I'm having a hot flush. Darling, darling, quickly, feel my skin.
  Feel my skin. Feel it.
Saffron: You're standing too close to the kettle.
Eddie: I thought I was drying up there for a minute, sweetie.

Eddie: All my friends are gay. All my friends are gay.

Eddie: God, I hate Morgan Fairchild.
Patsy: I hate Jane bloody Fonda.
Eddie: I hope all their old skin comes back to haunt them.
Patsy: I bought that bloody woman's tapes. I paid for those plastic
  domes on her chest. I want them when she dies.
Eddie: You know, there must be a moment, about a week after death,
  when all those women finally achieve the figure they desire.
Patsy: Skeleton thin with plastic bumps.
Eddie: The flesh will rot away, but the bumps will still be there.
  Little coffins full of bones and bumps.
Patsy: Yes.

Eddie, Patsy: [singing] They say our love won't pay the rent...
Eddie: I'm Cher, Patsy. I'm doing the Cher bit.

[last lines]
Eddie, Patsy: [singing] Wheels on fire, rolling down the road / Best
  notify my next of kin, this wheel shall explode.
Patsy: Mash potato. Watch out, darling.

Patsy: [singing] I can't get no... satisfaction.

Saffron: You stay and talk to them.
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: Oh no.
Saffron: Go back and talk to them, please.
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: I'd rather kiss a baboon's bottom.

Eddie: You are what you eat remember.
Saffron: Which makes you a large, vegetarian tart.

Oliver: Justin and I have a shop.
Eddie: A shop? That' s what you're calling it is it? A few miserable
  bits of furniture. You have to ring a bell before they'll let you
  in. Unwelcoming? Vincent Price could take lessons.

Eddie: [to Patsy] I went to a party the other night, Pats. I thought
  I looked so gorgeous, so cool, darling. I just flirted and was loud
  and gorgeous all night. You know, I was Kathleen Turner, Marisa
  Berenson, everybody...


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Book Clubbin' (#5.2)}
Plum Berkeley: Is that your daughter downstairs?
Edina 'Eddy' Monsoon: Did you see her?
Plum Berkeley: A bit fat, isn't she?
Edina 'Eddy' Monsoon: She's not fat, she's pregnant.
Patsy Stone: Yes, well anyway...
Plum Berkeley: By that big black guy?
Edina 'Eddy' Monsoon: What?
Plum Berkeley: Is she pregnant by that big black guy?
Patsy Stone: Shut up, Plum, just salute the sun!
Edina 'Eddy' Monsoon: Pats?
Patsy Stone: No, Eddie.
Edina 'Eddy' Monsoon: He's Black? [visions of a mixed-race toddler
  dance through Edina's head] I'm gonna have a mixed-race baby! I'm
  gonna have a mixed-race baby, darling!
Patsy Stone: It doesn't make any difference, it's still a baby!
Edina 'Eddy' Monsoon: It makes a difference, darling, a mixed-race
  baby is the finest accessory a person in my position could ever
  have, sweetheart! Oh, my God, it's the must-have of the season!
  It's the CHANEL of babies!


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Cleanin' (#5.1)}
Eddie: [to Emma "Baby Spice" Bunton] Well, see, the trouble with you
  is you're not giving me anything. You know, if you want something
  from the tabs, you gotta give 'em something back. You're just kinda
  flatlining nice and sweet, are you? And they want a little bit of a
  heartbeat. They don't wanna know your mum's your best friend, do
  they? They want it to be some one-armed, lesbian assailant seeker!
  They want the full cellulite shots! They want a forty-in-the-bed
  party with your Spice mates! They want your main lining,
  arm-jacking, smack-crack nightmare, darling! They want you fileted
  all over the butcher's block so they can photograph all your organs
  for "Heat" magazine! I mean, frankly, for once, I would like to see
  you foaming at the mouth, stinking of piss in the gutter with this
  little thumb stuck up Justin Timberlake's ass and you wearing
  nothing but a Gucci belt!


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Cold Turkey (#5.8)}
Edina: And for lunch, sweetheart, for Christmas lunch, who comes to
  that?
Saffron: Well, there's me and John...
Patsy: Is he from Gabon?
Edina: What?
Patsy: Is he from Gabon?
Edina: Gabon?
Patsy: Yes, is he from Gabon?
Edina: Why are you saying that...
Patsy: Gabon.
Edina: Will you stop saying that!
Patsy: Will you ask her if he's from the Gabon.
Edina: [Irritated] Is he from Gabon?
Saffron: NO!
Edina: No, he's not from Gabon, so shut up!


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Death (#2.2)}
Eddie: You only work in a shop you know, you can drop the attitude.

Eddie: God, it's a rather depressing thought that you might live on
  after me, isn't it? You, huh. That's how I'm going to be
  remembered, is it? What, through you?
Saffie: Well what do you want, a statue?
Eddie: YES.
Saffie: A great big, fat, ugly, armless statue?
Eddie: [pause] I've got arms. I've got arms. I just want to bequeath
  something to the nation, that's all, not just you.

[Eddie is in a body wrap]
Saffie: Mom, can you come downstairs please?
Eddie: Sweetie, have you seen what your talking to? Tutankamun.
Saffie: Mom, it's important. I've got some bad news.
Eddie: Darling, I can't move for an hour, I'm being shrunk and then
  I've got to go pick Patsy up from the hospital.
[Saffie sighs in annoyance]
Eddie: Well don't "tu-tuhhh." You think she wanted to get her stomach
  pumped again? No! She thought they were her antibiotics, darling.

[first lines]
Patsy: Do you want some ecstasy Eddy?
Eddie: Are you mad, darling? Nobody's taking that any more. People
  have been dragged from raves bleeding from every orifice.
Patsy: This isn't a rave. It's a "happening".
Eddie: Don't force to take it, Pats. I promised Saffy I wouldn't,
  darling.
Patsy: She'll never find out. She didn't scare me.
Saffie: Mum! Keep the noise down.

Eddie: Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.
Saffie: That's lovely.
Eddie: I hear you call my name and it feels like home.
Saffie: Who said that?
Eddie: It's Madonna darling.

Nurse: I'll see what I can do. But personally, I think you're wasting
  your money. You want to lose weight?
Eddie: Mmm...
Nurse: You want to move that fat bottom of yours and get your mouth
  sewn up. You want to help the environment?
Eddie: Mmm...
Nurse: Use your fat bottom and plug up the ozone layer.
Eddie: Alright! Are you trained at this?
Nurse: I am a nurse. Bandaging is what I do best. And I've got the
  manual.
Eddie: Good.
Nurse: Right. Have you recently had or are you due for your period?
Eddie: Well, yes, both. Is that important?
Nurse: No. I'm just making conversation.

Eddie: Is it alright if I move?
Nurse: Oh, there you go again. Mistaking me for someone who gives a
  damn! Who cares if you're fat or thin? Who cares if you live or
  die?

Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: Edwina dear, your father is dead.
Saffie: Well done.
Eddie: "Well done"? Did she finish him off or something?
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: That was it, wasn't it, dear? I'm
  not going mad, am I?
Saffie: Grandad has died! Is that all you can do? All you can say?
  Don't you think Gran needs a little bit more?
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: Oh, don't drag me into it, dear.
  She's doing her best, I'm sure. Now don't you get yourself into a
  state.
Saffie: Your father is dead! What does that make you feel, mum?
  [Edina is smiling]... And you can stop smirking!

Nurse: My God, woman! What have you done?
Eddie: What?

Eddie: [to Saffie] I've put on twelve inches all over my body! I
  mean, my body absorbs mud! Every pore is now an over-eater!

Eddie: [to Saffie] I do care, darling. Did he leave a will? What? I'm
  just asking! You know, asking!

Art Gallery Assistant: Can I help you?
Eddie: I want to buy some art.
Art Gallery Assistant: Have you seen something here?
Eddie: I don't know. I just... you know. I just want to get some.
  What else have you got?
Art Gallery Assistant: We're a specialist gallery. Perhaps if you
  knew what you were looking for I could help you.
Eddie: Is there someone else who can help me? I want to, you know,
  buy some art. I'm a collector. You know, that sort of modern stuff.

Eddie: No, no grave for me, darling. I'm a Buddhist anyway. I want to
  be laid down on a rock in the middle of the Ganges darling, and
  just be pecked by birds. I don't want to end up as some drugged-up
  zombie in a hospital, alright?
Saffie: I thought that would appear to you.
Eddie: I want to die with a bit of dignity, you know. I don't want
  the last words I hear to be "switch her off'.

Patsy: What am I supposed to do if you die?
Eddie: Get cabs!

Patsy: Eddie tells me that Mr. M... you know... dead.
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: That's right.
Patsy: Well, I um... condole you.
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: Thank you dear.
Patsy: He chose the right season to go.
Saffie: What do you mean?
Patsy: Well Harvey Nicks have got some really tasty little black
  numbers at the moment. And black is like "in". You wouldn't have to
  wear it only the once. It's my job to know these things.

Eddie: Family? Family? God, I hope you're not inviting that bloody,
  bollocky, selfish, two-faced, chicken, bastard, pig-dog man have
  you?
Saffie: You could just say Dad! I'd still know what you meant.

Saffie: So Marshall, how's the script coming?
Eddie: Oh no, do we have to know?
Marshall: Well it's at a real interesting stage.
Sondra Lorrance: You're doing just fine.
Marshall: We had Keanu Reeves pull out, which, which we feel really
  positive about now because it's taken a different course entirely.
  And, and a Japanese company has taken up the option to do it in
  animation form.
Sondra Lorrance: Pat yourself on the back for that.
Eddie: A cartoon...?
Patsy: A cartoon!
Marshall: Animation!
Eddie: A cartoon!

Sondra Lorrance: I too have felt great sadness. You are talking to
  someone who has sat through "Beaches" twelve times.
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: Really?

Patsy: Do you think the Yankee bimbo from hell is gone?
Eddie: God, I hope so, darling!

Eddie: This is... This is a, sort of... corpse... in an open, oaken,
  oblong coffin... Silky lining. It's a dead body, Pats.
Patsy: Yeah, but is it art, Eddie?
Eddie: No, sweetie, it's my father.
Patsy: Are you sure?
Eddie: Yeah, I think so. But I've just never seen him in a suit
  before.

Eddie: I mean, what's the point of grieving if there's no one there
  to see you do it?
Patsy: You're right, Eddie. You're always right!

[last lines]
Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: Let's hope someone fills them in
  before they get help.
Patsy: Eddie!

Eddie: I should be there! Shouldn't I? I mean, he would want me to be
  there.
Patsy: He'd want you to be there.
Eddie: He'd want me to be there. He'd want me to be there!
Patsy: Yeah.
Eddie: He'd want you to be there, as well.
Patsy: No, I don't... I don't think he'd want me to be there.
Eddie: If you want the house darling.
Patsy: He'd want me to be there!
Eddie: He'd want you there!
Eddie, Patsy: Come on, darling.

Eddie: I don't want to die! I don't wan to die!
Saffie: Oh, dear!


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Donkey (#4.4)}
Edina: I'd just once like to take my clothes off and not be marked by
  them...

Patsy: Eddy, you know your stomach's like a dog that doesn't know
  when it's going to be fed next. It just hangs around until you want
  to kick it.


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Fashion (#1.1)}
[first lines]
Saffie: [Edina turns off the music] Thank you.
Eddie: [gasps] Panic attack! Panic attack! Panic attack!

Eddie: [drunkenly] I don't know why it went wrong with Justin. I
  mean, you know, cause we did just adore each other, you know.
Patsy: He's gay.

Eddie: Everybody's there, everybody! Big names, you know. Chanel,
  Dior, Lagerfeld, Givenchy, Gaultier, darling. Names, names, names.
  Every rich bitch from New York is in there. Hockwenden,
  Ruttenstein, Vandebilt, Rothschild, Hookenfookenberger, Dachshund,
  Rottweiler, sweetie.
Patsy: A row of skeletons with Jackie O hairdos.
Eddie: Harper's, Tatler, English "Vogue", American "Vogue", French
  "Vogue", bloody Aby-bloody-ssinian bloody "Vogue", darling. Jeff
  Banks and Selina Scott couldn't even get a ticket, darling.

Eddie: Sweetie, make mama a cup of coffee. You're so clever and you
  know where everything is, darling, don't you? I think it's
  marvelous the way that you know where things are, darling. I think
  you're marvelous.
Saffie: Flattery won't turn me into your servant. The coffee is on
  the table in front of you. Pick up a spoon, put coffee in cup, pour
  on boiling water...
Eddie: ...Yes, yes, and scald hands and get third-degree burns,
  screaming in agony. Do you really want THAT on your conscience this
  morning, darling?
Saffie: All right...
Eddie: Thank you, sweetheart. No, not instant, darling. Not instant.
  Grind some beans, for God's sake. Instant coffee: is just old beans
  that have been cremated. I don't want THEM. I want them entire,
  with life force today. Could you not pull that face while you
  grind? I don't really want to drink a cup full of your anger...
  Anyway, I shouldn't be drinking coffee, I shouldn't be bloody
  drinking coffee! I don't want any coffee, darling! Throw all that
  coffee away! I don't want any bloody coffee! I just wanted some
  fennel twig tea, or something, I don't know.

Saffie: Major motion pictures are made, huge concerts are put on in
  stadiums. I mean, for God's sake, five hundred thousand troops were
  mobilized in the Gulf, and a war fought and won in less time, and
  without everyone included having a nervous breakdown and being sent
  flowers. It cannot be that difficult.
Eddie: Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Darling, every troop didn't have to contain
  Yasmine Le Bon. The generals didn't require big hugs after every
  maneuver, and the whole operation did not have to be co-ordinated
  to rap and Japanese avant-garde pipe music because, you know,
  darling, I think if it HAD, the outcome might have been rather
  different, don't you? Hmm?... Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
  to go and get dressed.

Eddie: Why do you have to pick on everything I do? Darling, all I
  want is a few little things, a few little pleasures, a few little
  crutches to help me get through life, darling.
Saffie: Get through? Mum, you've absolved yourself of responsibility.
  You live from self-induced crisis to self-induced crisis. Someone
  does your hair, someone chooses what you wear, someone does your
  brain, someone tells you what to eat and three times a week someone
  sticks a hose up your bum and flushes it all out of you.
Eddie: Oh. OH... It's called colonic irrigation, darling. It's not to
  be sniffed at.
Saffie: Why can't you just go to the toilet like normal people?
Eddie: Is that what you really want me to be, darling? NORMAL? Some
  boring, old, normal, old, toilet goer, huh? HMM? "Where is mommy?"
  "She's on the TOILET." "But I want to go somewhere interesting and
  meet exciting people". "Well, she can't take you while she's on the
  bloody TOILET". Why, anybody can go to the toilet, darling, these
  days.
Saffie: Well, they obviously haven't seen YOU drunk.

Eddie: Right. Now, Bubble. I want a list of every PR company, every
  record company in this country. I want a copy of "Who's Who" and
  the latest edition of "Hello!" magazine. Let's get
  "celebritied"-up!... Come on! Bubble, I want four huge video
  screens down either side of the catwalk. I want to flash-up
  pictures of sad, but beautiful children, happy gay couples, slogans
  like "World Health", "No Pollution", "Fashion Cares", all right
  darling? And print up thousands of new invitations on green,
  totally recycled paper, and cab them around to everybody. Now, now!
  Now, darling. Now, sweetie! Now, now!... Okay, get on to Princess
  Anne's people and tell them that everybody there will be mentally
  ill. Tell her we'll sponsor her to wear a designer dress okay? And
  make sure she realizes that if she doesn't, those little children
  won't get anything... Bubble, press release: "Free Champagne
  Reception". Get on to Moët et Chandon, and tell them it's for
  charity! Get on to Joan Collins, and tell her it's free champagne!
  Oh, listen, look, darling. I don't want to wear this, sweetie. I
  want to look completely happening and unbiased. I want to... No,
  sweetie, just get me something from every collection. Alright,
  darling, come on! Come on! Leave that, darling, leave that.

Eddie: Stop looking at me like that, sweetie! What do I have to do to
  convince you I've given up drinking? Hmm? I had one bloody drink,
  sweetie! Are you accusing me of something?
Saffie: Have you looked in the mirror this morning? Your eye bags are
  ruched.
Eddie: What are you eating, there? What are you eating?
Saffie: Toast.
Eddie: What is that on that toast?
Saffie: It's honey, Mother.
Eddie: Honey, darling? That's not honey, that's my bloody royal jelly
  moisturizer, sweetie. Good God, you're eating three hundred pounds
  worth of royal jelly, darling. It's been hand-squished out of a
  bee's backside. And not any old bloody bee, but the bloody Gucci of
  bees, darling. This is the stuff, sweetie, that Jackie Stallone
  would kill for this, darling. [scrapes it off the toast] That's
  better. Make me a cup of coffee, darling.
Saffie: You know where it is, make it yourself.
Eddie: I don't know where it bloody is, do I?
Saffie: Please don't swear.

Eddie: Oh, look at the time, sweetie. I should be in the office!
  Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie! Tell them, tell them the car
  hasn't arrived, there's traffic door-to-door, and I'm not well! I'm
  not well!
Saffie: Hello? My mother's sitting here in her dressing gown, with
  her face...
Eddie: [Edina starts screaming and snatches the phone from Saffy]
  Yes, it's me, darling. "Dressing gown", she knows nothing about
  fashion. Anyway, now listen, sweetie. I'm literally out the door
  when my bloody car turns up, alright? And I'm managing to keep a
  lid on things this end, alright? I know you can manage that end,
  Bubble darling, alright? I'm chanting as we speak, bye-bye,
  darling. [hangs up. Saffy is staring at her] You're not a Buddhist,
  darling. You wouldn't understand.
Saffie: Mum, you did for a week, which admittedly for you is a
  record.
Eddie: It's not a fad, darling. It's not like crystals. [Buddhist
  chanting] Omrankatingtingtong... Omrabremnimah...
Saffie: Please, stop it!
Eddie: Sweetie, you wouldn't say that if you knew how much we owe to
  my chanting, darling. A lot of things in this house, this HOUSE
  wouldn't be here, darling. I chanted for this gorgeous house! I
  chanted to be successful and believe in myself... [aside] Please,
  let me make some more money so I can buy Saffron some more books
  and a car... Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!... Please. [to Saffy] In
  Buddhist, obviously, darling, not in English, when I do it
  properly.
Saffie: What is it? Some sort of a cosmic cash machine?
Eddie: Oh, God! Could you try not to be so cynical today. You know,
  today I need just a little bit of bloody support.
Saffie: Well, why is today such a panic, anyway? It's only a fashion
  show, and you've had six months to prepare it. I mean, why is
  everything always so hysterical? I mean, all you've got to do is
  play a bit of music, turn on the lights, get some people who've
  thrown up everything they've ever eaten and send them down a
  catwalk. Greater feasts have been achieved in less time and with
  less fuss.
Eddie: Not quite with it, darling, are you?

Eddie: I forgot to ring Chukhani. He was going to channel a color for
  me today. [dials a number on the phone] Chukhani, it's Edina.
  Green. Thank you, darling. [Saffron laughs to herself] Don't look
  at me like that. There's more to it, you know.
Saffie: Of course, there is. The bill.
Eddie: Sweetie, sweetie. He doesn't just choose the color... Listen,
  because you might learn something, now. He doesn't just choose the
  color himself, darling. It is related to who I was in a previous
  existence.
Saffie: And who was it you were in a previous life, then? I suppose
  you were the Elizabeth Taylor of the Ming dynasty?
Eddie: Well, close, yes.
Saffie: So how come you've ended up just a mad, fat, old cow?
Eddie: Will you stop saying the word "fat"? Stop it, now! Stop it! I
  know you're only saying it to annoy me. Aren't you, darling?
Saffie: No, I'm saying it because it's true.
Eddie: Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God!
Saffie: What happened then?

Eddie: Darling. Darling, look at Mummy. Look at Mummy, sweetheart. Do
  I need surgery, darling?
Saffie: Yes.
Eddie: Alright.
Saffie: Get your mouth sewn up.
Eddie: I'm still here, darling. I heard that.

Eddie: Yes, but I pay you to interpret my dreams, so why can't you at
  least find a hidden depth? Well, I, I'm not willing to believe I'm
  simply THAT obvious. And, if you are bloody psychic psychologist,
  how come I'm always having to call YOU, hmm? Oh, just stuff it!

Eddie: La Croix, sweetie! It's alright, isn't it? A bit tight, but
  it's alright, isn't it? You know, people will think, "Wow, it's a
  La Croix!", okay? I just can't find anything to go with it.
Saffie: Maybe I can throw up on something for you.
Eddie: [puts on a jacket] I'll wear this one.
Saffie: Oh, I see. Somebody already has.
Eddie: Jean Muir.

Patsy: What are you wearing, Eddy?
Eddie: La Croix.
Patsy: It's fabulous.
Eddie: Good... Thank you.

Eddie: Darling, stop me drinking today because Saffy's threatened to
  leave home again.
Patsy: Darling, you don't drink.
Eddie: Yes, I know I'm not a drinker, but you know what she's like, I
  mean...
Patsy: A pig.
Eddie: God, I must ring in and tell them I'm coming.
Patsy: What will you drink if you stop drinking?
Eddie: I shall drink water. [pause] It's a mixer, Patsy. We have it
  with whiskey... I mean, you know what it's like, you've given up
  drinking before.
Patsy: The worst eight hours of my life.

Eddie: Right, it's me. I'm on my way in. Everything's completely
  under control this end, how is it with you? Lights... Models...
  Guest list?... Just do your best, darling. I'm rushing. Bye.

Patsy: [Saffron has refused to go to Edina's fashion show and her
  son, Serge, is also unavailable] You know, I sometimes wonder what
  the point of having children is if they're not going to turn up for
  your launches? Did you tell him how important for you it was,
  darling?
Eddie: Yeah, I tell him. I faxed the bloody dean, the bollocky halls
  of residence and the buggery mountain rescue. I mean, what more can
  I do?
Patsy: Nothing, and you shouldn't have to. I mean, look at you.
  You've been a fantastic mother. You've let them ruin your figure.
  Your stomach's stretched beyond recognition, you've got tits down
  to your knees, and what for, for God's sake? For a potholer who's
  worn nothing but a purple nylon tracksuit and a Gazza t-shirt for
  the past two years. Cut the cord, darling.

Eddie: Right. Now, Bubble, did all the models turn up?
Bubble: Yeah, every single one.
Eddie: Good, good, thank God.
Bubble: Except one.
Eddie: Except one? You're not going to tell me it's Yasmin Le Bon,
  darling?
Bubble: No.
Eddie: Thank God!
Bubble: Oh, no, sorry, yes. Yasmin Le Bon is ill.
Eddie: Oh, my buggery bollocks. Why the bloody hell didn't you tell
  me earlier?
Bubble: Well, her husband's just phoned, and said "Simon Le Bon",
  which I thought was really amusing.
Eddie: Amusing, darling?
Bubble: Yeah. Very modern of him to have taken his wife's name.
Eddie: Oh, Bubble, sweety...
Bubble: I phoned around, and I think I may have found a replacement.
Eddie: Good. Who? Who?
Bubble: Betty Boo.
Eddie: Shit!

Eddie: Now, come on, come on, come on. How's the celebrity and V.I.P.
  list looking?
Bubble: Good, I think. But you know me, I don't know anybody.
Eddie: Now, come on darling. Come on darling! Just tell me about Joan
  Collins, Stephanie Powers, Paloma Picasso, Charlotte Rampling,
  Catherine Deneuve. Give me some names, darling.
Bubble: So far?
Eddie: So far.
Bubble: So far Sinnita and Anne Robinson definite. We're still
  chasing Anneke Rice. Gave up on Norma Major.
Eddie: Now, just get me my phone book now, would you, darling? Get me
  my phone book. I mean Princess Di has...
Bubble: Anne.
Eddie: ...to have somebody to sit next to. You don't get Princess Di
  to a major...
Bubble: Anne.
Eddie: ...fashion event.
Bubble: Anne. Princess Anne.
Eddie: As well as, is it, darling?
Bubble: Instead of. Only. Oh, possibly with daughter.
Eddie: Why, why?
Bubble: Well, there was a bit of a mix-up. I didn't make the call,
  but she's very game and a really nice person.
Eddie: Oh, I wouldn't care if she was Mother bloody Teresa, darling!
  It doesn't matter for our purposes! What we need is a Princess with
  a press following and a designer dress on her back!
Patsy: Not someone who looks like she runs up her own.
Bubble: Well, her people were a bit cagey about which designer she
  favoured.
Patsy: The only label she wears is "Drip Dry".

Patsy: Right I'm off. Are we eating?
Eddie: Yes, after. French, Italian, whatever you like, sweetie.
Patsy: No darling, no one's eating that sort of food anymore. There's
  a fabulous new Japanese in Mayfair. Everything is raw. Anything
  with a pulse is lunch.
Eddie: Alright, darling, whatever.

Bubble: Oh, the magazine called for you, Patsy. They need some
  decisions about this month's cover.
Patsy: Oh, really? Whatever can they need to know? I mean, it's the
  same every month: a model in make-up with a vacant look on her
  face...

Patsy: Have you got something I can pee into? I want to do another
  test.
Eddie: Bloody hell, Patsy! Wash it this time, will you? Anyway,
  darling, who was it you were with last night?
Patsy: Oh, he was just a windscreen washer I picked up at the traffic
  lights...
Eddie: Oh.
Patsy: Buns so tight he was bouncing off the walls.
Eddie: Bye Pats. Darling, bye.

Patsy: Darling, you are a fabulous, wonderful individual.
Eddie: Oh, thank you.
Patsy: And remember, I've known you longer than your daughter, and
  anything you do is alright by me. You're my best friend,
  sweetheart. Can I take your car?

Eddie: I'm going down in history, Pats, as the woman that put
  Princess Anne in a Vivienne Westwood basque.

Patsy: I mean, Betty Boo and Dannii Minogue did their best, but
  frankly...

Eddie: If I squat down I'll piss myself.

Eddie: Sweety, darling. Sweety, darling, Mummy's here. Sweety,
  darling, Mummy is... Sweety, darling, let me in. Sweety, darling,
  let me in!

Eddie: [to Saffron] You've probably got something rather interesting
  to listen to on Radio 4, have you?

[last lines]
Saffie: [on the phone] Oh, hang on a moment. [to Edina] Mum, it's the
  Betty Ford Clinic.
Eddie: What do they want, sweetie?
Saffie: They say they're confirming the booking for four weeks from
  next Monday.
Eddie: Sweetie, I think it's the only way. Don't you, darling?
  [Saffron nods] I'm going to swallow my pride and do it, if that's
  alright by you. [Saffron nods again] You've been very good to me.
  Thank you.
Saffie: [hugging Edina] Well done!
Eddie: Thank you, Sweetie. [as soon as Saffron leaves, Edina talks
  into the phone] Thanks, Pats.


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Fat (#1.2)}
Eddie: You took from me the only man I ever really loved. You're just
  a spiteful bitch, Penny Caspar!
Penny: Morse. Penny Caspar-Morse, now.

Saffie: [Edina is chanting in Buddhist] Oh, dear.
Eddie: Morning, sweetie. I'm only going to wear orange from now on,
  darling. Religious purposes.
Saffie: You've been getting dressed for three hours and you still
  look like a bloated citrus fruit.
Eddie: Sweetie, it is a very healing color, a very positive color.
  [continues chanting] I'm getting rid of all my other clothes.
Saffie: Is that really the best you could come up with?
Eddie: Oh, God! Well, only this and the deaded kaftan fitted. Well, I
  say fitted. It was filled to capacity. I mean, all my clothes have
  got stretch marks, darling.

[explaining why she never did exercise]
Eddie: In the sixties, we were too stoned to jog. In the seventies,
  we had platform shoes.
Justin: That high.
Eddie: and in the eighties...
Justin: Brain cells destroyed in the sixties. See, you know, she
  can't remember. The Age of the Punk.
Eddie: Yes, punk darling. We were too busy putting pins through our
  noses.
Saffie: But you were too old to be a punk, weren't you?
Eddie: Darling, I was a punk.
Saffie: I know.

Eddie: [looks in mirror] Euch!... I am a little "Germaine Greer-ish",
  aren't I, sweetie?
Saffie: I think she's great!
Eddie: Oh, darling, she was once cool, but Mr. Gravity's been very
  unkind to that woman!

Eddie: Honestly, I mean, you wouldn't believe how much I weigh.
Saffie: I would.
Eddie: I know I don't look hugely overweight, darling...
Saffie: You do.
Eddie: I mean, what I saw in that mirror shocked me. Barbara Bush
  with no clothes on. I don't believe it.
Saffie: Who did you expect?
Eddie: Well, Marisa Berenson, of course.
Saffie: Who?
Eddie: I have only ever seen Marisa Berenson. Sometimes Cher.
Saffie: Pre-knife. Do you want a cup of tea?
Eddie: Oh, no. Coffee. Black, I shouldn't drink milk.

Eddie: Oh, God. Why am I so fat?
Saffie: You're not SO fat.
Eddie: I am! Why?
Saffie: Well, for start, you eat too much, you drink too much and you
  take no excercise.
Eddie: Darling, darling, please. It's far more likely to be an
  allergy to something, you know... You know, sort of a build-up of
  toxins, or something, or hormone imbalance, isn't it? Hmm? And
  also, sweetie, did you know I've got a very heavy aura? Did you
  know that? That's why animals love me, darling.
Saffie: They just see you as something to hibernate in.

Saffie: Look, mum. All you've got to do is eat less and take a bit of
  exercise.
Eddie: Sweetie, if it was that easy, everyone would be doing it.
  Anyway, I don't know what you mean. I do take exercise!
Saffie: You get out of bed, it ends there.
Eddie: I know what I'll do, I'll wait 'til Patsy gets here and phone
  her doctor. He'll do anything. And if that doesn't work, darling.
  I'm gonna go down to that Chinese clinic...

Eddie: Well, sweetie. The reason... It's not what I eat or how much I
  eat, it's these things in here. This fridge is just filled with
  crap, darling. Just filled with crap. Honestly. Look at this! I
  should only be eating organic food, food with the dirt still on it,
  darling... Throw out all the food in this fridge. It's revolting. I
  should just be eating green and white holistic food, shouldn't I
  sweetie? I shouldn't be eating... Oh, that's still got some in it,
  sweetie. I shoudn't be eating all this, should I, darling? Anyway,
  first I'm going to go on a fast. [Saffron stares in disbelief]
  Well, it's not the sort of fast you're thinking of, darling. It's a
  special fast.
Saffie: Sort of an "eating a lot" sort of fast?

[on the subject of Eddy's fatness]
Eddie: Just try and help me. Try.
Saffie: Well, what can I say?
Eddie: Well, darling, just try to be little bit less Western in your
  thinking, if you can, please. I mean, you realize, of course, that
  in Zen terms everything in the universe is just molecules, don't
  you? Ying and yong, ping and pong... Mmm? You know that, darling?
  These are my molecules and that's your little clump of molecules
  over there, sweetie. I mean, in real terms, there's no difference
  between me and the coffee, me and the table, me and a tree, me and
  Madonna, for God's sake!
Saffie: Except that you have a fatter bottom.
Eddie: Oh, shut up!
Saffie: Well, what you want me to say? Mum, it doesn't matter to me
  that you haven't seen your navel in twenty five years, or that you
  can wear your stomach as a kilt. Just tell me you're happy.
Eddie: How can I be happy with this great bulk hanging off of this
  skeleton? I can't.

[still on the subject of Eddy's fatness]
Saffie: All right then. Do something about it but do something
  sensible.
Eddie: Pshst. Can you not use that word in this house, please,
  darling.

[still on the subject of Eddy's fatness]
Saffie: I mean, you're not ill. You don't have a disease...
Eddie: As far as I know.
Saffie: You're not menopausal?
Eddie: No, still very much menstrual, thank you, sweetie!
Saffie: You've been tested for everything under the sun, so you're
  not allergic to anything...
Eddie: Wrong. Jelly fish!
Saffie: There's more of your blood sitting in test-tubes around the
  world then is currently circulating in your veins. I mean, you've
  tried every fad-drug, every fad-diet that's ever existed. I mean,
  more money is being poured into your quest for "Twigginess" than
  goes in aid of most Third Word nations and somehow, Mum, somehow,
  you're still two stone overweight.
Eddie: One stone, actually!
Saffie: Mum!
Eddie: Well, darling, I mean, you know, for my height.
Saffie: How tall?
Eddie: Six foot.

Saffie: Well, you can't have anything in common. You can't have
  Anything to talk about.
Eddie: Ha. She doesn't want somebody to talk to, darling.
Patsy: I've got you to talk to.
Eddie: Exactly. I mean, no one blinks an eye if an older man goes out
  with a young girl bimbo, do they? Or what's really sick... , Listen
  now Patsy, what is really sick, darling, is when a non-bimbo girl
  goes out with a really old man. That's sick, isn't it, darling.
Patsy: Brrrr.
Saffie: Mum, what is this world you live in? What does "bimbo" and
  "non-bimbo" mean?
Eddie: The real world, darling.

[first lines]
Eddie: Yes, yes, yes, yes... It'll be alright with a bit of
  jewellery. [weighing herself] Oh, God, this is stupid. No, no, no,
  no! I've never been this heavy. There's not enough room on my bones
  for that sort of weight. No, no, no, no, no, no... [drops her
  earings to the floor] Those are real gold, they must weight more
  than that. God!

Saffie: I take it you want a chocolate croissant then?
Eddie: "Pain au chocolat", we call it in this house, darling. And no
  thanks, I won't. I'll just nibble a corner of yours. There's only
  one thing to be done... It's just the chocolate I have to avoid in
  these, darling. I'm alright with the pastry.

Eddie: [on the phone] Can I speak to Doctor Jackson, please. It's
  Edina.
Saffie: Mum!
Eddie: [to Saffron] Shh, sweetie. [into the phone] Philip, darling!
  It's Eddy. Look, can I have a few more of those pills I had last
  time? I want to lose a stone... Two weeks... Hmm, but it must be
  years since I had them last, isn't it?... Hmm, but they were just
  palpitations, for God's sake! Hmm? Are you telling me I can't have
  them?... What is the point of having a private doctor if he won't
  do what you want? Listen!... Please?... I want them to kill me!...
  Pilip? [to Saffron] Can you believe he's not going to give them to
  me, darling!
Saffie: Good. You can't just take huge quantities of speed to lose
  weight.
Eddie: You can, darling. He treats royalty, believe me. Anyway, who
  wouldn't suffer a minor coronary for that degree of weight loss, I
  ask you?

Patsy: Good morning, Eddy.
Eddie: Oh, Pats, look, just stand there. I'm going to lift my shirt.
  I want an honest opinion. [lifts her shirt up]
Patsy: Surgery. Liposuction on the stomach and hips, umm bum lift,
  tit lift, lose a rib.

Patsy: Eddy, do you remember that time I went out with Ferruzzi?
Eddie: Saffy, this man was fifty five years old, for God's sake.
Patsy: The only thing that got him up in the night was his bladder.
  Did you get it, Ed? Did you get it? The only thing he got up for
  was to have a slash. Remind me not to tell that one again when I'm
  sober.
Saffie: Sober? Chance would be a fine thing.

Eddie: Yes, you're right, I do need a bit of inspiration. I mean, I
  could go out and buy a lot of new clothes two sizes too small. but
  ooh I've done that before.

Eddie: [to her ex-husband Justin] How you could have chosen to live
  with an evil, vicious, pot-bellied, ugly little dwarf is beyond me!

Saffie: Oh, I just find it strange, that's all. I mean, I just can't
  understand how someone who could have been into absolutely
  everything over the past twenty years, I mean, not one trend has
  passed her by, yet somehow, she has conveniently dodged ever having
  to take any exercise. I mean, that fad, that craze was missed by a
  mile.

Patsy: Don't let her torture you, Eddy. I mean, she ruined your
  figure in the first place.
Eddie: Exactly!
Patsy: She's the one who turned you into this potato that we see
  before us.
Justin: Now, now, now, now! That's unfair. I mean, I liked you when
  you were sort of heavier. You know, you were more umm... umm
  cuddly.
Eddie: Oh, God! I'm sick!
Patsy: I'm going to throw up.
Justin: I mean, tough, really tough. Really tough.
Patsy: Let's go.
Eddie: We'll go on a public transport, Pats.
Patsy: Are you mad? I've got nothing to wear on public transport.
Eddie: Yes, but sweetie, I will not have my daughter thinking she's
  so great, because she can use public transport. Anybody can use
  public transport, darling!
Saffie: I know. That's the point.
Eddie: Come on, Pats. I'll go and get that... map thing I always use.
  You know, the "A to Street Map" thing-book. Come on!

Eddie: [after taking a cab into work] I mean it's public, and it's
  transport.

Eddie: Now is there anything I should look at?
Bubble: Yes, a few of them what-you-call-thems have come through.
Eddie: What?
Bubble: Paper comes out...
Eddie: What, what paper?
Bubble: Very important, urgent paper.
Eddie: What? Tell me, tell me.
Bubble: The paper that comes out of the answering machine.
Eddie: Fax?
Bubble: Messages, letters, the lot. It comes and it comes. Anyway,
  them. I've managed to get a couple of them down. I copied them onto
  me pad.
Eddie: Let's have a look. [reading] "We've been saved by English
  Heritage." What does that mean?
Bubble: Where?
Eddie: It's here, "saved".
Bubble: No, "sued".
Eddie: Well it's only four letters out, I suppose that's alright.
  Sued, why are being sued, darling?
Bubble: Well, that last fashion shoot you organised. Apparently,
  someone moved a couple of rocks, or something.
Patsy: Moved a couple of old rocks? My God!
Eddie: Stonehenge, Pats. Anyway...
Patsy: So? They should be glad of the publicity.
Eddie: Exactly, exactly. Send that one to my lawyers. Now... [reads]
  "Penny called from L.A.". Penny who?
Bubble: It'll come to me. It's only urgent-ish. She's coming over in
  a week or two. She wanted to talk to you about a shop, or
  something.
Eddie: Yeah...
Eddie: She wanted to sell you some things, or something.
Eddie: My shop, remember? I'm opening a shop, Bubble.
Bubble: Ah...

Eddie: I'm opening a shop, Pats.
Patsy: Ooh, what are you going to sell?
Eddie: Oh, just gorgeous things, you know.
Patsy: Ooh, lovely.
Eddie: Gorgeous, tasteful, little stylish little gorgeous things.
Patsy: Expensive...
Eddie: Obviously, yes. They'll be present-y Anoushka Hempel-y sorts
  of things everywhere.
Patsy: Chocolates?
Eddie: Garden implements, that sort of thing. [flicking through a
  magazine] I can't find anyone I want to look like... Oh! Oh, she's
  not bad. Who's that?
Patsy: That's Ivana Trump.
Eddie: She's good, isn't she?
Bubble: Do you think so? She looks like a classic bimbo to me. All
  that terrible blonde hair piled on top of her head. False tan.
  She's far too thin. Always pouting. Absolutely no character. The
  skirt's too short. I mean, it's pathetic these older women
  struggling to look twenty five... Sorry.
Patsy: I think she's tremendous.

Eddie: You're very thin, aren't you, Bubble
Patsy: She's emaciated, like her brain!
Bubble: I know, it's awful. I can eat as much as I like and I just
  don't get fatter. I cannot put on weight.
Eddie: Oh, how terrible...
Bubble: I know. I wish I was more curvy. I wish I had breasts like
  yours.
Eddie: No, you don't.
Bubble: Yes, I do.
Eddie: No, you don't.
Bubble: I do! Great, big, large, pendulous breasts. I'd like to fill
  a bra.
Eddie: No, you wouldn't. Just stop saying you do. You don't know what
  it feels like. You think, just because you feel better with a
  couple of oranges stuffed down your cups, that you know what it
  feels like. Well, you don't. It's hell.
Bubble: I don't have to wear a bra. I just stuff the oranges down me
  vest.
Eddie: Listen, you little bookmark. You know I only employ you
  because you make me look better, don't you?
Bubble: I've remembered what she's called. Penny Caspar-Morse!

Penny: Who's that? Pat Ast? Now, there's a girl who gives the word
  "hippy" a whole new meaning. Move over, Mama Cass! Move out of the
  way, sweetie. You're blocking my light. Is it an eclipse? No,
  Edwina's in the room. We can cancel Woodstock, everybody. They can
  play on Edwina's behind!

Patsy: [about Edina] Poor old fat old thing. Look at her, like a
  beached whale in designer sheets.

Eddie: I mean, what you two don't seem to realize is that inside of
  me... , inside of me, there is a thin person just screaming to get
  out.
Mother: Just the one, dear?

Eddie: And do you know, darling, the real problem started, sweetie,
  because I wasn't even breast-fed.
Mother: Oh, don't be ridiculous, dear. It wasn't done in those days.
  [points to Edina] Imagine me having that clamped to my breast.
Eddie: Mmm... I want better for you, darling. I want better for you,
  I don't want you ending up like me, with all my complicated, but
  still rather marvelous hang-ups. I don't want that, sweetie. I
  don't want that. At least you were breast-fed.

Saffie: Was I? By whom? You told me your milk dried up, your tubes
  blocked and your nipples dropped off.
Eddie: Well... Well, they did, they did!
Saffie: So who was I breast-fed by? Not one of the many saggy-tittied
  hippies who lived with us at the time, I hope.
Eddie: Darling, it was a commune. That was the point. Anyway,
  sweetie, I mean, they gave you a good start in life, didn't they? I
  mean, you're alright, aren't you? Sweetie, you're alright, aren't
  you?
Saffie: How many? Which ones?
Eddie: It doesn't matter, they've all died of overdoses since. I mean
  it doesn't matter. Anyway... Anyway, sweetie, can I just say that
  at least you're not fat like me.

Patsy: [about Penny Caspar-Morse] Okay, okay. She's here. Eddy, great
  news.
Eddie: She's fat?
Patsy: No, no, no. Better than that.
Eddie: She's dead!
Patsy: No. She's blind.
Eddie: Yes! Yes, she's blind! Yes!

[last lines]
Eddie: Now you come back trying to sell your little bits of tat for
  my shop. My shop! Well, what a comedown! Because I'm the successful
  one now, aren't I? I, I'm rich and happy and I've got a wonderful
  family and friends.
Penny: I want you to know that I am no longer coping with this.
Eddie: Well, I don't have to go to a plastic surgeon to keep my body
  together, do I. No, no, no. Because I want to tell ya, I've got my
  fantastic bone structure. I am thin and gorgeous!
Penny: Thin? Ha!

Saffie: [to Eddy] You've been getting ready for three hours and you
  still look like a bloated citrus fruit.

Saffie: My hair is not anywhere near you!
Patsy: Your face hair.

[last lines]
Eddie: So you've been diddled. It's happened to us all, once in a
  while.
Patsy: But it's not the money, Eddie.
Eddie: What is it?
Patsy: It's the horrible realization that I must have actually
  enjoyed playing ping-pong.

[first lines]
Eddie: Come on, wake up! Come on! Come on, Bubble, try and
  concentrate! I've got some important information I have to tell
  you. I am going to be in France for nearly a whole week and I am
  counting on you to cope. Now, there is only one thing that you have
  to concentrate on this week, and that's the refurbishment of
  Bettina's apartment.
Bubble: The refurbishment of Bettina's apartment.
Eddie: It's very important, I promised it would be finished this
  week. When she said "Third world chic", I was hoping she would
  stick to it, but it took me hours to get hold of that fly-blown mud
  Hessian for her kitchen walls. I mean there is a nomadic tribe in
  the Northern African desert that's going to be traveling rather
  light this winter, thanks to Bettina. Also, when the wood arrives
  for the kitchen surfaces, remember to stamp "Greenpeace approved"
  on it.
Bubble: "Greenpeace approved".
Eddie: Alright? Yes, and if the silk for the cushions doesn't arrive
  by tomorrow, then fax Calcutta and tell them to weave faster. God,
  what can they be doing? Squatting inside the room, making
  chapattis? Poor Bettina. Bonjour, bonjour. Oui, oui! Also, darling,
  I'll try to phone you from my mobile, but I'm not sure that it'll
  work from France.
Bubble: Even if it does, I'm not sure I'd understand what you were
  saying.
Eddie: Oh, darling...
Bubble: You do speak French, don't you?
Eddie: Of course I speak French. Someone has been stealing from me.

Mother: It's a sort of space-age teapot, isn't it dear? A teapot to
  boldly go, where no teapot has been before, to seek out new life
  forms.

Mother: What might one use to put the tea in the pot with, dear?
Eddie: A teaspoon, a bloody, buggery teaspoon!
Mother: Ooh! A bloody, buggery teaspoon. That sounds rather clever.
  And what did one fill the kettle from? The bloody marvelous tap, I
  suppose?

Mother: This filtered water boils very fast.
Bubble: That's because there's less of it.
Mother: Ah.

Eddie: You! Remember: Cancel my aromatherapy, my psychotherapy, my
  reflexology, my osteopath, my homeopath, my naturopath, my crystal
  reading, my shiatsu, my organic hairdresser... and see if I can be
  re-birthed next Thursday afternoon.
Bubble: Consider it done.

Patsy: [to the air hostess] Sullen, stingy, bloody French bitch.
Air Hostess: [drops a packet on peanuts on her lap] Madame.
Patsy: Moiselle. Mademoiselle.

Patsy: You can't go to France and not drink.
Eddie: Huh?
Patsy: The chateau we're staying at is in the middle of a vineyard.
  The area alone is fifteen percent proof.

Eddie: Am I on the wrong side of the road, or the wrong side of the
  road? I can't go on until I'm sure.
Patsy: Keep driving, Eddy. You haven't hit anything yet.
Eddie: This is here. I should be on the right-hand side of the road.
Patsy: Look, do you want me to drive?
Eddie: Oh, so speaks the woman whose head has been lolling around
  like a bladder on a stick for the best part of the journey. Read
  the maps, get the maps. [Patsy hands Edina a map] This is Spain.
  Read the instructions.
Patsy: "Leave airport, turn right..." Blah, blah, blah.
Eddie: Right. Now, get in, Pats. I shouldn't have gone left, should
  I? I mean... We're going back to that bloody airport, Pats, or
  we'll never find it. Oh, God! I hate France, I hate it!

Eddie: A cockroach! A cockroach! A dead cockroach! No don't kill it,
  darling! I'm a Buddhist, I could come back as one of those. Oh!
Patsy: I think that one had a coronary, sweetie.
Eddie: Oh, God! Insects, insects! They followed me, those bloody
  insects. Insects follow me everywhere, darling. From Tuscany to the
  Caribbean. Insects, insects, insects! You know, I usually see
  pictures of glamorous houses in Marrakesh, for God's sake. You
  don't see spiders scuttling into the corner. You never see a
  picture of Jane Seymour with a centipede dangling from her bloody
  tiara! No, they just follow me, they bloody follow me. I mean, a
  mosquito has never bitten you, for God's sake!
Patsy: The last mosquito that bit me had to book into the Betty Ford
  Clinic.

Eddie: Well, I'm very sorry about the bloody ozone layer, but this is
  a matter of human surival here.

Bubble: Oh, this sort of thing's never happened to me before.
Saffron: Well, you've never done anything before.
Bubble: I know.

Saffron: [answering the phone] Hello?... Mum?... No... How can you
  have malnutrition?

Patsy: Eddy! Rosemary's Baby has arrived with food!

Saffron: It's lovely here.
Eddie: It's lovely, yeah.
Saffron: How can you not be enjoying it? It's so peaceful and
  relaxing. Just walking, and reading, and playing games. It's fun.
Eddie: Fun? Hmm. I can see it should be fun, I know it should be fun,
  sweetie. It's... It's like a secret no one's let me in on. You
  know, it's your sort of fun. Mmm? Yeah.
Saffron: Yes. Well, I think I'll go and have a stroll in the village.
Eddie: Alright. I won't come.

Eddie: [Patsy is trying to snort a glass of wine] Darling, don't
  snort it. Just drink it, sweetie.

Eddie: [drunkenly getting into the right side of a French car] Shit!
  Someone's taken the steering-wheel!

Eddie: [trying to complete a jigsaw puzzle] It's so stupid! I mean,
  they, they've made the holes the wrong shape for the pieces.

Bubble: [playing Monopoly] Oh, I'm broke.
Patsy: Take another mortgage. Don't give in.
Bubble: What, on a "get out of jail free" card?
Patsy: Well, try.
Saffron: I thought you were broke. Where did you get all that money
  from?
Patsy: Don't question me.
Saffron: Where did you get it?
Patsy: I borrowed it from the bank.
Saffron: Well, you can't do that. That's cheating.
Patsy: Listen, you little stoat. I own Park Lane. I can borrow as
  much money as I like.

Patsy: [to Bubble] Listen, you little gonk. If you tell anyone what
  he said, I'll kill you.

Eddie: [to Bubble] I don't know why I don't sack you.
Saffron: [Bubble starts to cry] Don't be silly, Mum. Where else are
  you going find someone who makes doing nothing into an art form?
  [to Barry] I'm sorry. I had to say that.
Bubble: It's alright. I didn't quite understand what you meant.

Patsy: I need to see my lawyer. I must be allowed to make that
  telephone call before my freedom is finally snatched away from me.
Customs Officer: That won't be necessary Miss Stone. The white powder
  we found was a perfectly harmless innocent substance.
Eddie: [gasps] Oh!
Customs Officer: You're all free to go.
Patsy: I beg your pardon?
Customs Officer: You're free to go. Be a bit more careful next time.
Patsy: Just hang on there! I demand that you re-test it! Come back
  here! I paid a, a huge amount of money for that substance! Don't
  tell me it was talcum powder!

Patsy: Goodbye aging obscurity and 'Hello.' Magazine.

Patsy: [Patsy's affair with an MP has become front page news on all
  of the papers] Oh well, heigh ho, Eddy. [pours some champagne into
  a glass] I mean, you know, let them write what they want . . .
  [starts to read another feature] Continued on page five. I mean, I
  shall just rise above it. I shan't let this thing affect me in . .
  . bastard! No! No! No!
Eddie: Who, who? Where, where? What, quick, what? Show, show, show!
  [Patsy hands Eddy the newspaper, Edina reads aloud] Source is . . .
Patsy: No, no, no - further.
Eddie: Pasty is . . . uh?
Patsy: Yes?
Eddie: Aged forty-seven!
Patsy: Aagh! I'll sue!

Patsy: [tears up newspaper] Oh . . . it's just not fair.
Gran: [Gran enters reading the newspaper headlines] Another pig-ugly
  MP making a fool of himself with some scrawny old hooker, I see.
Patsy: Old? Old! Old, old, old!

  Patsy comes in, I want you to treat her with a little bit of
  respect, alright?
Patsy: [entering] Click, click, flash, flash. Click, flash, flash,
  flash, click, click, click. Flash, flash, flash. Guys, guys, just
  give me a break, darlings! Just give me a break. I have a life to
  lead! Click, click. "This way, Patsy!". Fellows, fellows, fellows.

Eddie: You alright, darling? You're not letting this get to you, are
  you?
Patsy: No, of course not.
Eddie: A little bit of Bolly?
Patsy: Yes, just a smidge. [looking at newspapers] Oh, are these
  todays?
Eddie: Yes, sweetie.
Patsy: Anything in them?
Eddie: Not much, darling, no.
Saffie: [reading from the paper] "M.P. in drug-crazed sex romp with
  shock with fash-mag slag".
Patsy: Damn!
Eddie: I know. Well, there is that, thank you very much, sweetie.
  Well, in fact you're front page on most of them, darling. But it
  has only been a day, you know.
Patsy: I mean, who could still possibly be interested in reading all
  this?
Saffie: His wife?
Patsy: Listen, Saffy. I am the victim in this case. I mean, he's just
  using me for publicity. He's just riding on my back to get his
  pathetic little face in the papers.
Eddie: Exactly, sweetie! Patsy's had the hassle and trauma. She's
  been forced to leave her flat, darling.
Saffie: Forced? Even the cockroaches left that whole of their own
  accord.
Eddie: They are trying to make out, darling, that Patsy is some kind
  of sex-crazed, morally corrupted, drunken, high-classed,
  prostitute, darling!
Saffie: Pretty accurate, so far!

Eddie: [reading newspaper headlines about Patsy] Look at this! "Four
  Letter Patsy In M.P. Sex Row!".
Patsy: "Orgy Of Alcohol And Sex Near M.P.'s House!".
Eddie: Ridiculous! Those bastard scum filth parasites of the press,
  darling.
Saffie: Well, make up your mind. One minute they're scum, and the
  next you're giving them lunch and pouring booze down their throats
  in the great name of P.R.!
Eddie: Booze? Booze, sweetie? Booze, darling? Is that what they call
  it down the Uni bar? Booze, sweetie? Is it? Will you be popping in
  there, darling, after a hard day's lecture for some half a pint of
  shandy-booze? Some pork scracklings? Oh, God. Where was I? [picks
  up another paper] "Illicit Passion For M.P.'s Posh Clothes Mag Gal
  Pal!". Oh, God. "Shocked Wife Of M.P. Keeps Silent!".
Eddie, Patsy: Bitch!
Patsy: Bitch!
Patsy: [picks up another paper] "Queen Furious". That's not you.

Patsy: You know, in my day...
Saffie: Your day? Which century was that?
Patsy: In my day, there was a sense of style about the whole thing,
  you know. Christine Keeler, Mandy Rice-Davies... Gorgeous little
  women who kept their mouths shut and just looked gorgeous, and gave
  the whole thing an air of dignity. You know, that's the way I
  should play it, Eddie. Not like these penny tarts of recent times.
  Kiss and tell, blurt it all out, for the promise of a quick buck
  and instant fame. Not me, sweetie. My lips are sealed.
Saffie: You'll do "Hello!" magazine, though?
Patsy: Ooh, yeah!
Eddie: Might as well do it in the comfort of your own home.

Patsy: [to Antonia] Would you like to follow me into my gracious
  drawing room?

Eddie: Sweetie, darling, could you just stop that minute and come and
  help me here? Come, unwrap all these things. They're all objets
  from my shop, darling, so keep the price tags showing. The woman
  from "Hello!" magazine is here, and I haven't finished decorating
  the room.
Saffie: Why bother?
Eddie: Because, sweetie, what you can't tell about a person by what
  they have chosen you to see on their coffee table isn't worth
  knicker elastic. [holding up an object] What do you think darling?
  Look, look, look. What do you think? It's an Eskimo papoose. Huh?
  Don't look like that, sweetie. Any chance of a quick buck in the
  Artic, they tip the babies out and ship them down, I tell you.

Antonia: [interviewing Patsy for "Hello!" magazine] Is it a miracle
  that you are walking again?
Patsy: It is a miracle that I can walk at all... I bless the wonder
  of life... and the newness of living.

Sarah: Jed might be around tomorrow night, as he and I sort of...
  hang out a bit, you know. Catching up on lecture notes and that
  sort of thing.
Saffie: Ooh...!
Sarah: No, nothing like that. I know what you're thinking.
Eddie: You may be sorely disappointed there.
Sarah: Although, the other night... He did get locked up in our part
  of the hall.
Eddie: Poor bastard!
Sarah: And he did have to sleep on the floor in my room, but...
Eddie: Only because he couldn't chew through the restraints with his
  bare teeth, I should think.
Sarah: You see, Jed's really, really lovely...
Eddie: [to Saffron] Could you just shut Titicaca up here for a
  second?

Antonia: [interviewing Patsy for "Hello!" magazine] And when will the
  baby be born? Do you hope to have a big family? Of course! How
  stupid of me. Those questions were transparently for a much younger
  woman. [pause] And you're not Annabelle Croft?
Patsy: No, I'm Patsy Stone.
Antonia: Stone? [thinks about who Patsy is] Oh! Did your life change
  much after "Basic Instinct"?

Eddie: [on the phone] Yes? Bonjour. Oui. Just put me... [to Saffron]
  Four bloody languages and they can't specialize in one. [back to
  the operator] Just put me through to Zermatt! Zermatt!
Saffie: Who are you calling?
Eddie: My Doctor Philip, darling. He's skiing in Switzerland. [into
  the phone] Hello? Hello, Philip? Yes, it's Edina... You know that
  foot of mine, darling? Yeah, I just bashed it on the door-frame.
  It's very painful. Huh? Huh?... Oh, God! [to Saffron] He just hit
  the grand slalom. I can't hear him from wind noise.
Patsy: Eddie?
Eddie: Oh, Pats, darling, how did it go?
Patsy: [pointing to sticky face lifts on her face] Do these work?
Eddie: For how old, sweetie?
Patsy: Thirty five.
Eddie: You might need a few more for thirty five, I think, darling.
Patsy: How much more?
Saffie: A bungee jump with the elastic tied to the back of your head
  should get that back into shape.
Eddie: [on the phone] Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, oh! Operation?
  Darling. Hospital, yes. Alright, alright, thank you. [hangs up] Did
  you catch that, darling? I've got to go to hospital.
Patsy: Hospital, Eddie? I'll come with you.
Eddie: Alright, I'm going to have to pack and order the ambulance and
  everything.
Saffie: Why don't you take your car?
Eddie: Because, sweetie, I do not pay huge insurance premiums, so I
  can just drive myself to hospital, alright? And not stay overnight,
  okay? Come on, Pats. Which one shall we go to? Cromwell? Heritage?
Patsy: Champneys.
Eddie: They've got a pool, don't they?

Nurse: [looking at what Edina is wearing] Mary! Mary, come in here a
  minute and look at this?
Nurse Mary: Mother of God! What is it?
Nurse: You know, my daughter could get away with wearing something
  like this?
Eddie: Maybe she'd get away with it, but I doubt very much if she'd
  be able to afford it!
Nurse: Why, she's only three years old.
Eddie: Well, just furnish us with the appropriate drugs and then
  leave the room please.

Eddie: [to the Nurses] I want a drip and a little heart-bleep
  machine, here. Alright? I've seen "Casualty", I know what goes on.

Nurse: [looking at Patsy] Hello, dear, I thought I recognized you.
Nurse Mary: It's that old slag in the papers last week.

Antonia: Where am I here?
Patsy: In my gracious drawing room.
Antonia: No, I mean where is this? Shepherd's Bush?
Eddie: Holland Park! Holland Park! It's not on the outskirts, either.
  It's not the edge of Holland Park. This is the rich heartland of
  Holland Park here. All right, is the photographer here yet?
Antonia: No, we never do photos on the same day. Next week.
Eddie: It's a seventy-foot drawing room with west-facing garden. One
  point five million.

Catriona: And she believes chairs are as important to civilisation as
  a masterpiece of something. I wrote it down somewhere. So we could
  print that up and do some lovely photos.

Eddie: I demand to see a doctor!
Nurse: Mr. Simpson will be round in a minute.
Eddie: Mr. Simpson? Mr. Simpson? I want a proper doctor in a white
  coat who's going to take me seriously. And give me some more
  painkillers now, all right.
Mr. Simpson: Right, Mrs. um, um...
Nurse: Monsoon.
Mr. Simpson: I'll be operating on your um, um, um...
Nurse: Foot.
Mr. Simpson: ...tomorrow morning.
Eddie: Hold my hand, darling. He could be the caretaker for all I
  know!
Mr. Simpson: We could do this under local. It's not a very serious
  operation. It's very quick.
Eddie: Local? Local anaesthetic? Are you mad? God, what is this?
  Eastern Europe?
Mr. Simpson: You wouldn't feel any pain.
Eddie: I won't need to feel it, but I'd be able to see it! I'm not
  totally lacking in imagination you know. I want total sensory
  deprivation and back-up drugs, all right!
Saffie: Believe me, she's much happier unconscious!

Nurse: [pointing to Patsy] Face-lift
Mr. Simpson: Oh, it'll be a doggle. Just grab her by the scalp,
  shaker her up and down a bit and chop off the slack. Tomorrow.

Eddie: [to the Nurse] Oi, you! Bitch-nurse. You just keep me on the
  threshold of pain. I want some more painkillers. Look. I have two
  tiny little paraplegics or something in this cup. Over an hour ago!
  And don't look at me like I'm mad, I know you've got Valium out
  there.

Patsy: Magda!
Magda: Hello, Pats! How are ya? Unlucky business with the M.P. Still
  the "Hello!" thing should sort that out. I better make this quick
  I've got a lingerie opening and a feminine wash launch to get to by
  six, and all this with my working champagne lunch with Anouska
  bloody Hempel floating about here. This month I want articles about
  how lovely spending money is. Expensive things, the better
  cosmetics are great. I want money, money, money. Spend, spend,
  spend. I don't want to see any more photos of gormless skeletons
  with no brains, no make-up and no bloody tits.
Patsy: Promoting bored teenagers won't sell a Chanel suit.
Magda: Naw, they're too thin!
Patsy: Too young!
Magda: If the models get any younger, Pats, they'll be chucking
  foetuses down the catwalk!

Fleur: Couldn't we make a feature: Our Editor.
Catriona: Yes, and then we could use all these lovely photos.

Dream Mother: [to Edina] I was just passing dear. Goodness, you're
  looking young. You hardly seem to have changed since you were a
  little girl.

Eddie: Saffy. Sweetie, you wore the La Croix.
Dream Saffron: I will always wear LaCroix from now on when I'm in
  town, Ma.

Eddie: NHS! NHS! NHS!

[last lines]
Eddie: Never mind, darling.
Patsy: Hey-ho!
Eddie: You're not crying, are you, darling?
Patsy: No, sweetie. There's just this little wound under my eye that
  won't heal. The wound on this side won't heal either. Eddy!


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {ISO Tank (#1.4)}
Eddie: Bubble? Listen! What is your job?
Bubble: What's me what?
Eddie: What is it you do, darling?
Bubble: I don't really know. Nothing. Get paid?

[first lines]
Saffron: [phone rings] Hello?
Eddie: Saffy, it's me. Listen... Darling, I'm in the isolation tank
  in my bathroom. Don't leave the house without telling me. Alright?
  I'm going to see if I can last another fifteen minutes.
Saffron: A call came through for Patsy, but I couldn't find her.
Eddie: Alright. Okay. [to Patsy] There's a call come through for you
  Pats.
Patsy: I'd better go, Eddy.

Eddie: Is champers all right with you, Pats?
Patsy: Lovely, sweetie.

Eddie: Now, Pats, shall we finish off the Beluga or should we have
  some smoked salmon nibbly things?
Patsy: Oh, whatever sweetie.
Eddie: All right, we'll finish off the Beluga.

Patsy: Well, shall we have a bitch through "Hello!" magazine and the
  "Enquirer"?
Eddie: Oh... no...
Patsy: Come, on, sweetie. Catherine Oxenberg, Liz Taylor, Khashoggi,
  Shahpari Khashoggi, darling. All that money and she's still got a
  moustache. Oh, sweetie, one more facelift on this one and she'll
  have a beard. And darling, why do we think Pricilla Presley wears
  gloves?
Eddie: Oh, I don't know.
Patsy: Liver spots, sweetie. Don't you remember?

Eddie: Oh, where is Bubble? What's happening here? What is it? What's
  happening?
Bubble: I'll just go through a few of the things in this week's
  diary.
Eddie: Alright.
Bubble: Charity: Emporio Armani, drinks, lunch, launch, Gucci
  opening. Invites for fashion shows: Westwood, Hamnett, Jackson,
  Richmond. I said yes to all. But you can do Westwood. Party, party,
  party, party, party... Koo Stark is having a retrospective of work
  she has yet to do. That'll be drinks and a press call. Book
  launches: One. Bill Wyman's "Coping With Cystitis". Press call and
  ribs at Sticky Fingers. Party, party, party, movie meetings. Two.
  Paula Yates, her book, "If I Can't Have A Career, Why Should
  They?". There will be a party, and she will be expressing milk
  throughout.
Eddie: Oh, I'm not going to that.
Bubble: Linda McCartney, Joan Collins, Emma Freud, Marie Helvin,
  Ivana Trump. Ivana Trump, the launch of her new perfume "The Smell
  That Lingers Longer Than He Does". Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York,
  Paris...

Patsy: [about Saffy] Don't let her talk to you like that, Eddy. Tell
  her she's adopted.

Eddie: You can't even tell Patsy about arranging balls, darling. She
  was always very good at genetics.
Saffron: I'm not surprised. She's been a walking sperm bank most of
  her life.

Saffron: Look, mum, it's not my fault I dont't want to loll around
  naked, painted day glow, with a flower stuck in every orifice...
  humping the air to Jefferson Airplane.
Eddie: It was The Grateful Dead, darling.

Eddie: Right. sweetie, I'm going to go to my isolation tank now. I
  may be some time. I could sink!
Saffron: Not with your ballast.

Eddie: Sweetie, if you don't let me come. I'll adopt a Romanian baby.
  I would.

Patsy: [seeing Saffron] Oh, my God, there's something horrible on the
  stairs.
Saffron: It's me.
Patsy: I'm not blind.
Saffron: What are those pills?
Patsy: Don't question me.
Saffron: Mum?
Eddie: Darling, they're just hormones, so I can breast feed the
  Romanians when they come.

[last lines]
Patsy: You want to hear a new joke, darling?
Eddie: Oh, yeah.
Patsy: It's not in very good taste.
Eddie: No.
Patsy: The thing is this... You know Elizabeth Taylor?
Eddie: Mmm...
Patsy: Well, I hear that she is the new ride at Disney World.


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Magazine (#1.6)}
Patsy: [nervous on TV] You can never have enough hats, gloves and
  shoes.

Patsy: Yeah. Cheers. Thanks a lot.

[first lines]
Edina: Oh, God! Oh, sweetie! [burglar alarm starts wailing] Oh, God!
  Saff! Darling! [Saffron turns off the alarm]
Saffron: [explaining how to turn it off] Zero, zero, zero, enter.
Edina: Stupid little thing...
Saffron: I made it the simplest number possible, so that even a fool
  could remember it, but I overestimated you again.
Edina: Well, what's the point of it, if it's just going to make a
  bloody racket all the time?
Saffron: It's supposed to.
Edina: I wouldn't care if someone came and took all the furniture,
  darling. I can get it back on the insurance. I can't get a
  perforated eardrum back from insurance, can I, sweetie?
Saffron: Look, I've got to go and call the central station and let
  them know my mother has the memory span of a fruit fly. And then I
  need to speak to you.
Edina: Oh, darling! Yes, speak to me, sweetie. I'm shaking in my
  boots, darling.

Saffron: What are you smirking at? Do you think this is funny?
Edina: Oh... Funny what, darling? Funny ha-ha-ha?
Saffron: You might have rung and let me know what you were doing.
Edina: I was too busy doing it, darling. What's the matter? Are you
  jealous?
Saffron: No, worried.
Edina: Oh, worried about me having some fun? Well, I was darling.
  Bloody great, bloody fun, alright?
Patsy: Ask her who with?
Saffron: Who with?
Edina: Jean-Pierre.
Patsy: That bastard! You didn't tell me he was around.
Edina: Oh. I sort of ran into him by accident, darling. He's over
  here directing a new video for a hip-rave-rap... band, darling.
Patsy: I thought we were going out. [about Saffron] Thanks to you, I
  had to spend the whole evening alone in this house with Helena
  Bonham Carter, here! I'm going back to bed. There's no point in me
  being up at this hour. [gets a bottle of scotch] Helps me to sleep.
Edina: Yeah.
Saffron: Back in your coffin.
Edina: Darling! Patsy's an insomniac, sweetie.
Saffron: More like the living dead.
Edina: Oooh! Oooh!
Saffron: [about Patsy] How long is she here for?
Edina: I don't know. How long are you here for?
Saffron: How long?
Edina: Well, until her flat has been fumigated, darling. She can't
  live in it breathing fumes all day, can she?
Saffron: Why not? I thought sniffing chemicals was what she did best.
  I'm surprised she's not up there already with a straw stuck up her
  nose. She should try it, you know. It might actually be the one
  substance that makes her socially acceptable.
Edina: Darling, it would kill her!
Saffron: Exactly!
Edina: A few hormones, talking there, haven't we, sweetie? Huh?

Saffron: So, Jean-Pierre...
Edina: Yeah, yeah!
Saffron: Is he over long?
Edina: Well, it sort of depends on me, you know, darling. He sort of
  made it very clear last night that he was very well re-smitten. If
  you know what I mean?
Saffron: Did you...?
Edina: Of course, darling. I know it's been a long time for me, but
  it must be like riding a bicycle, really. It's something you never
  forget.
Saffron: Well, I hope...
Edina: Very careful, darling, yes! The whole packet!
Saffron: Mum!
Edina: Well... Once you've brushed off the cobwebs, there's no
  stopping me.
Saffron: Oh, please. I don't want to know.
Edina: Well, darling. You asked the question. No point getting all
  umphy about it now, is there? Anything else you'd like to know,
  sweetie?
Saffron: No, thank you.

Edina: I know it's a sensitive issue with someone your age, darling.
  And a bit embarassed to talk about it, aren't you, sweetie? Mm? My
  analyst says that I should let you sort it out in your own time,
  and everything. But Jesus Christ, darling! Not one bloody boyfriend
  in the whole time that I've known you! I mean, you're not that
  bloody ugly! What's the matter with you? Huh? Have you read that
  "Karma Sutra" I gave you? No! That Dutch cap has only ever seen the
  light of day. I mean, God! Here I am, your mother, poised for your
  first sexual experience and night after night, dry bloody sheets!
  I'm sorry, darling, but I don't want a little moustached virgin for
  a daughter, so do something about it! Unless of course...
Saffron: Mum, don't!
Edina: Well, darling...
Saffron: Mum, please!
Edina: Unless of course... Unless of course you're gay, darling.
Saffron: Mum!
Edina: Sweetie! Are you darling? You can tell me, sweetie. Are you
  darling?
Saffron: Yes, I'm gay.
Edina: Oh, hoorah! [pause] Well done, darling, well done!
Saffron: I'm glad it makes you happy, but actually, I'm not.
Edina: What?
Saffron: I'm not gay! [Edina looks disappointed] Sorry.
Edina: Oh! Break it to me like that, why don't you? Yes... I suppose
  it's not your fault, really, is it? Just your old mother clutching
  at straws. Trying to find one exotic, interesting feature about
  you, but there we are.

Saffron: [to Patsy who is coughing up her lungs] All night I've had
  to hear that! Any more hacking, and you'll bring up oil.

Patsy: Are you going to the office?
Edina: Yeah, I have to sort out a few things about the shop, darling.
  It's going very well, by the way. I've got gorgeous things coming
  in from Kashmir, Afghanistan, Albania... I've got blankets and rugs
  coming in from Ethiopia. Dirt cheap, darling, honestly. And some of
  those lip plates from dead Amazonian Indians. I thought we could
  sell them as ashtrays. [Saffron looks appalled] Don't look at me
  like that, darling. We do take the lip off, you know! Honestly,
  sweetie... I've got some lovely cooking pots coming in from
  Somalia. I mean, they don't need them. They've got no food to put
  in them at all. And also, sweetie, best news of all time, darling.
Patsy: Yes?
Edina: You know those villages that were deserted by the Kurds?
Patsy: Yes.
Edina: I bought the entire contents.
Patsy: Oh, well done, Eddy!
Edina: I know, I know, the trucks are moving in.
Saffron: Coups, revolutions and disasters, they're all bargain
  basements to you!
Edina: Oh, darling! They're happy camping.

Edina: What are you doing today, Pats?
Saffron: I hope she's not lolling around the house again.
Edina: Will you shut up? Will you just shut up? I'm not talking to
  you. I'm talking to my friend. Is that alright? God, it's like
  living with a chronically-depressed budgerigar, living with you.
  Shut up! Pats?
Patsy: I'm going in to my office.
Edina: Your...
Patsy: ...Office.
Edina: Office? The magazine, darling? Is that still there?
Patsy: Of course it is. There's a little meeting, you know. So I've
  got to go, you know. About ten minutes.
Saffron: What do you do?
Edina: Darling! Patsy is one of the top fashion editors in a top
  magazine.
Patsy: Director.
Edina, Patsy: Executive Fashion Director.
Saffron: But she's never at work.
Patsy: I am always at work.
Edina: Yes, thanks to our friend, Mr. Mobile Telephone. Anyway,
  Patsy's got that job for life.
Saffron: [about Patsy's job] You don't mean to say she's actually
  good at something?
Edina: No, darling. She slept with the publisher.
Patsy: ...And I'm bloody good at it!
Edina: Bloody good at it!

Saffron: So, what does a fashion director do?
Edina: Oh, darling! She get's a fifty per cent discount at Harvey
  Nicks.
Patsy: It's not only that. There is work involved. You know, skill.
Edina: Yeah, of course there is.
Patsy: I... I decide what goes in the magazine.
Edina: Yeah.
Patsy: You know, one snap of my fingers and I can raise hemlines so
  high, that the world is your gynaecologist.
Edina: Exactly. You get lots of free champagne, don't you?
Patsy: Yeah. I direct...
Edina: The fashion. Yeah. You get lots of little free goodies, little
  things, you get.
Saffron: You two have never had to pay for anything! Have you?
Edina: I paid for you, darling.
Patsy: A hundred times over!

Catriona: [describes what can be done with the magazine] Well, we
  could tie that in with some... glasses. A friend of mine has got a
  shop with some lovely... glasses.
Fleur: Henrietta?
Catriona: Yes. Maybe we could do some lovely... photos.
Magda: What about people? You know... Who's in, who's out, who's
  sexy, who's not sexy, who's clever, who's not clever.
Catriona: Right. Who's in, who's out.
Magda: Here's my list. Cross her off, she screwed me. Oh, and put him
  in, he screwed me. Do something on River Phoenix, I really fancy
  him.
Catriona: Right.
Magda: River Phoenix, Mickey Rourke, Liam Neeson. Don't do anything
  on anyone called Freud. I don't like them. Bunch of no-talents with
  an ancestor.
Catriona: But they were in last month.
Magda: So? I'm not running a bloody charity. Just because some old
  granddaddy invented penis-envy doesn't mean I have to lick their
  boots!

Saffron: [to Patsy] Would you mind dragging your old carcass out of
  here, now?

Patsy: [to Saffy] You may dress like a Christian, but the similarity
  ends there. I think you do it on purpose. How long does it take you
  to get the crease so crisp down the front of your jeans, you
  torturer?

Patsy: Yes, well... I never knew my father. My mother only knew him
  fairly briefly.

Patsy: [about her mother] She didn't want a child. She would've got
  rid of me, but she mistook being pregnant for the menopause. When
  she found out it was too late.

[last lines]
Edina: What are you doing tonight, Pats?
Patsy: Seeing the publisher again. You know, just to be sure.
Edina: Darling, even Amanda de Cadenet would remember the word
  "accessories".

Kathy: Now... umm, later on, we'll be taking an in-depth look at
  acute schizophrenia from nine twenty to nine twenty three. And
  afterwards, what else but euthanasia? We're going to be talking to
  a couple of people who pulled the plugs on their elderly mothers,
  so you better watch out, dear!

Patsy: [talking to Eddy] Look, I just don't want you to make a
  horrible mistake again.
Edina: What do you mean?
Patsy: Darling, I'm your best friend. And let's be honest: Your taste
  in men is famously bad. You know, sweetie, I've had to save you
  from two disastrous marriages, and some ghastly pathetic affairs
  you might nearly have had.


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Menopause (#4.6)}
Jobo: [to the MO group members] Come on sisters. We're getting
  nowhere. [stands] My name is Jobo, and I'm happy to be having the
  menopause. [group members clap for her] I have hot flashes and
  cramps, and sometimes when I sneeze, I pee.
Beth De Woodi: [stands up] Beth De Woodi. The sands of time are
  trickling through my hour glass!
Patsy Stone: [raising her hand] Patsy Stone. I hope you're wearing
  thick underpants!

Eddie: The mouse.
Bubble: Yeah! The mouse! That's got the tele with VD!
Eddie: All right... [sighs] The VD... The Word Processor.

Eddie: You broke the computer?
Bubble: Yeah!
Eddie: When?
Bubble: Who can say?...

Eddie: We've got everything.
[Leaves the house. Two seconds later storms back in]
Eddie: Tickets, money, passports! Tickets, money, passports!

[Listening to headphones and singing]
Bubble: No no... No no no no. [Shaking crazily] No no no no! No no!
  There's no limit! No!...
Eddie: Bubble! Bubble! Bubble! Bubble! Bubble! Now listen, darling
  please.

[first lines]
Eddie: Sweetie! Oh, darling! Oh, God, sweetie! What a day! What a day
  I've had, sweetie, darling, darling, darling! I have been at work
  since I left here this morning!
Saffron: Do you want some lunch?
Eddie: No, I had lunch in the studio. Studio, sweetie, studio.
  Studio, darling. Action, lights, camera.
Saffron: What have you been doing?
Eddie: Pop -Specs ad.
Saffron: What?
Eddie: You know I represent Pop-Specs darling? We're doing a new ad.
  We're up marketing the image.
Saffron: What are Pop-Specs?
Eddie: What are Pop-Specs! Are you dead? Are you dead? These are
  them! These are them! Look, darling. These are Pop-Specs! They are
  great. Look. Do you see that one? Here's another one, darling.
  Schizophrenia! They're fantastic!
Saffron: How can you up market those?
Eddie: Well Patsy's agreed to put them in a photo shoot in her
  magazine. And there s a new ad darling. New ad, sweetie, which is
  mainly my idea. My original idea. It's very clever. God! It better
  bloody work otherwise my company is gonna be left with one minor
  department store, two student designers, Smudgibars and Lulu paying
  for your upkeep, darling. And Lulu is like that, sweetie. You could
  show a little enthusiasm, you know.

Saffron: Mum, why should I be happy that you're going to spend
  thousands of pounds on...
Eddie: Hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Saffron: ...persuading people to buy some cheap bit of plastic junk
  that they don't even want?
Eddie: Don't know they want yet... sweetie.
Saffron: ...That will then be thrown away after a couple of months
  once the novelty wears off and sit around polluting the planet.
Eddie: That's it, is it? That's it, is it? Can I show you, can I show
  you something, sweetie? Can I show you something on this? Look at
  that. [Eddy points to "Pop-specs" bag] What do you think that is,
  there? What is that?
Saffron: It's a sticker with a green tree on it.
Eddie: Yes.
Saffron: What does that mean?
Eddie: Kind to trees, sweetie.
Saffron: How are they kind to trees?
Eddie: Well, they ain't made of wood. How kind do you want them to
  be?

Eddie: Study? You don't go to Marrakech to study, darling.
Patsy: No you don't!
Eddie: There are lots of reasons to go to Marrakech and studying is
  not one of them, sweetie. You go to Marrakech for I don't know,
  drugs, dirt-cheap plates and rugs.
Patsy: Yeah, easy-going sex with gorgeous, under-age youths...
Eddie: Yeaaah. Sex changes, doesn't it, Pats? Well, not now, anyway.
  Not now, anymore.

Saffron: Well, mum...
Patsy: No, Eddie!
Eddie: What?
Patsy: No, to whatever she's going to say!
Saffron: I'm talking to my mother!
Patsy: Just say no, Eddie!
Eddie: What?
Patsy: Just tell her no.
Eddie: I don't understand!
Saffron: Let me go to Morocco.
Patsy: No!
Eddie: Well why not let her go to Morocco? We're going to Marrakech.
Saffron: It's in Morocco.
Patsy: This little scud from hell is trying to slime her way onto a
  trip, and we don't want it.
Saffron: But, Mum!
Patsy: Don't you "But, Mum" her!

Eddie: Just do whatever you want sweetie.
Patsy: Eddie!
Eddie: Well... But as your mother, I cannot be held responsible for
  your well-being. Alright? If you come with us, you're on your own.

Eddie: [to Bubble] Now listen, you bloody brainless bimbo, I need
  this client! I don't need some bollocky vegetable
  Yankee-bloody-doodle to mess it up for me, alright!

Eddie: [to Saffy] Help mummy, darling.

Eddie: [to Saffy] Well, if you could try and look a little less like
  a Christian missionary, I'm sure we'll all be a lot safer. They're
  all Muslim around here, you know darling.

Uncle Humphrey: [to Saffy] I hope you didn't think I was some sort of
  dirty old man.

Uncle Humphrey: Now, would you like to try a local speciality?
Saffron: Oh yes, I'd love to.
Uncle Humphrey: Well, you take a pot of scented honey mixed with
  goat's cheese yoghurt, sprinkled with almonds from the Atlas
  Mountains. You spread it all over your naked nubile young body, and
  allow a man old enough to be your father to lick it off. Just like
  her mother. Tease, tease, tease.

Patsy: Let's do that Sonny and Cher number. [singing] They say I...
  [spoken] Hang on, I'll just get this chord right. [singing] They
  say I...

Saffron: Mum, that was Patsy?
Eddie: Don't worry about it darling. It was only for a year and then
  it fell off.

Saffron: Mum! That man pinched me!
Patsy: Darling, don't worry. He's obviously very old and completely
  blind.

Eddie: Have you eaten something?
Patsy: No, not since nineteen seventy three.

Patsy: [about Saffy] Pretty big tits.

Eddie: The stench, the heat. That's the last time I ever set foot in
  a toilet bowl in Northern Africa. I mean, how dare they spit at me!
  A nation that has a pillowcase with a slit in it as a national
  costume.

Ali: And they have to arrange catering for a movie they've been
  shooting here too.
Eddie: Oh, what movie?
Ali: 'Life of Jesus Christ II'.
Eddie: Who is Jesus these days?
Ali: Uh... Charles Dance.

Eddie: There's no bell! Hello? Hello? Hello? Have you got a toilet
  for the Madam.
Patsy: Madamoiselle. Moiselle.
Eddie: Can't you just not go in a hole somewhere?
Patsy: Go on Eddy, over there. Come on!

Patsy: [to Edina] Don't question me!
Eddie: The only thing I was in danger of sleeping with was a donkey,
  and even he did a runner.

[last lines]
Saffron: Come on. Wake up!
Eddie: Oh, God! Did I fall asleep here? Oh, damn. Wake up, Pats! Wake
  up, darling. Let's catch up on a bit of luxury, sweetie. Oh! I'm
  going to have some breakfast and sit by the pool or something.
Saffron: We've got to go, it's Friday.
Patsy: Friday?
Saffron: You've been unconscious for three days.
Eddie, Patsy: No!
Eddie: What's that smell? What's that smell? Is that you, sweetie?
  That sort of honey, yoghurty smell? Is that you?

Patsy: Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
Eddie: A bit of bad news, darling?
Patsy: Yeah, it appears the equipment has turned up.


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {New Best Friend (#2.4)}
Patsy: [about Bettina] Neat? She was so anally-retentive, she
  couldn't sit down for fear of sucking up the furniture!

Patsy: So no lunch then, Ed?
Eddie: Not unless Bettina arrives early. Then I shall have lunch with
  her.
Patsy: [in funny voice] Can I borrow the car?
Eddie: No, I'm picking up Bettina from the airport.
[Patsy puts her head down, upset]
Eddie: [under breath, annoyed] Oh god... Oh god... Well , what's the
  matter?
Patsy: I'm not happy.
Eddie: Well take the car. Just go. Go.
Patsy: I don't want the car.
Eddie: Well just go and be unhappy somewhere else. Go on... Go on!
[nudges Patsy]
Patsy: Don't touch me!
Eddie: Well just bug off! Bug off! Bug off!
[Patsy knocks an ash tray off the kitchen table and knocks
  candlesticks and ornaments off a shelf as she goes up the stairs]

Patsy: Oh hi Brit, it's Patsy.
Britt Ekland: Patsy?
Patsy: Stone.
Britt Ekland: Stone?
Patsy: Patsy, Patsy Stone, Stone Patsy, Patsy Stone.
Britt Ekland: Oh Patsy.
Patsy: Oh Brits.

[first lines]
Eddie: [to Saffy] Why didn't you wake me, sweetie? Well, I'm not
  going into the office today because Bettina and Max are coming, and
  I've got to clear the whole house up for them darling. Anyway, did
  I tell you Bubble's not there anymore, she's gone. I mean, someone
  offered her a pathetic junior post at 'Marie Claire', so I accepted
  for her. Let them pay her, darling, while we've got no work on. So,
  darling, sweet... Sweetie? Honey?

Saffron: You were checking the fly, weren't you?
Eddie: I have to, darling!
Saffron: I didn't think you still did that. It's been ten years since
  you saw that film, and Jeff Goldblum is now full-sized, wingless
  and living happily ever after in L.A.
Eddie: I know that, darling, but you'll be laughing the other side of
  your face the day you squash something with a little tiny human
  head against that window, darling. And it screams out "No, no! I'm
  a professor of physics! Take me back to my laboratory!" You'll wish
  you were a Buddhist then, darling.

Eddie: You don't seem to realise Bettina and Max are coming.
Saffron: So?
Eddie: Bettina, the Queen of minimalism! Look how I'm dressed,
  darling. Minimalist.

Eddie: Is this yours?
Saffron: Yes.
Eddie: Could it not be left around? Doesn't it have a home to go to?

Bettina: [monotone on minimalism] We like it. We think it's the new
  millennium.

Patsy: I should have sued. I was cut to ribbons, scarred for life.
Saffron: Extraordinary how it managed to hit you in exactly the same
  place behind each ear.
Eddie: Sweetie!
Patsy: Go on, Eddie, go on
Eddie: What?
Patsy: Well go on, go goon. You're going to tell this little trail of
  cat sick that I was badly injured and not to question me.
Eddie: No, I wasn't. I was gonna say, "Sweetie, darling, if you want
  to be some help to Mama, go upstairs and clear surfaces. Go on,
  darling." Mwah, mwah, mwah. [points to June] Take her with you,
  take her with you. Clear her, clear her. Neat and neat and neat.

Patsy: Where's Mags' diary? I want to know what she's doing for
  lunch?
Bubble: She's got a meeting.
Patsy: Why haven't you written it in?
Bubble: I'm not completely useless, you know. It's all in here.
  [points to her head] It's with someone called... it's gone.

Eddie: Bettina and Max! Clear, clear, clear, clear!
Saffron: I'll just say hello and then I'll go.
Eddie: No, you are not going to say hello. You must get in here. Flat
  against the wall, hold your bag close, and when they come, you go.
  Hi, hi.
Max: Hi, hi.
Bettina: Hi, hi, hi. Max, can you bring me the other cloth?
Max: Where is it?
Bettina: Blue bag, not the terry one. You know, the one near the
  bottle warmer by the playpen.
Max: The bag that fits the buggy or the backpack?
Bettina: No, the one that's by the mat near the music centre. That
  one, sam material as the sling.
Max: You used it on the plane.
Bettina: No, I didn't. Oh, Christ Max, we only had those four bags
  and the Moses basket on the plane.

Bubble: What you gonna do?
Patsy: Don't question me.

Mrs. June 'Gran' 'Mother' Monsoon: [listening to Edina cheat with Max
  on the baby monitor]... Is that Radio 4 dear?

Eddie: Where have all my surfaces gone, darling? It's like living in
  a small regional branch of Mother-Bloody-Care darling, isn't it?
  They've got to go, darling, so I can return to some degree of
  normality.
Saffron: Whatever that is.
Eddie: Yes, whatever that is, darling. It's not this no-fun bloody
  baby world, is it?

Patsy: [to Eddy] Darling, darling, do think it's time for a little
  collagen? Plumping?
Saffron: It'll take more than collagen to fill your face.
Patsy: It's just a little plumping.
Saffron: How many whales will have to die to fill those crevices?
Patsy: It's just a little filling!
Saffron: If you pull out the whaling fleet they may not be able to
  cope with the demands.
Edina: [to Saffy] Sweetheart, just a little filling.
Saffron: Mountaineers have died falling into shallower raveens than
  your wrinkles.
Edina: Oh, shut up!

Bubble: Minnie Driver? Is it a dwarf?


# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Parallox (#4.1)}
Edina: [Edina had an overdose of parralox and cannot speak
  coherently, nor move her facial muscles, so she seems spastic]

Labour Party Man: [shocked] Oh my god! What's the matter with her?
Edina: Gggglll... doodoo... ggggllll... Oooo... gggggg!
Saffron: She always does this! [smacks her, revolted] She does it for
  attention!

Edina: No Twiggy, we want to go with you for this. We could've gotten
  Kylie, but we know you have more class. You don't need to parade
  around with a pair of gold lame hot pants wedged up your chocolate
  starfish to make an impression.
Saffron: What's happened to your face?
Edina: Darling, she's just had a bit of the botox.
Patsy: No, it's not botox. It's "parralox."
Saffron: You look like a zombie.
Edina: She still has emotions, you know. She just doesn't have to pay
  for them in wrinkles.
Patsy: I'm happy about that, can't you tell?
Edina: No.
Patsy: Money well spent.

# "Absolutely Fabulous" (1992) {Poor (#2.5)}
[Edina is sitting in court next to her lawyer, with Patsy, Saffron
  and Gran behind. They are looking up at the magistrate, who is
  reading out the list of charges against Edina]
Judge: ...driving without a license, driving without insurance, not
  wearing a seatbelt, having no tax disc displayed, driving over the
  legal speed limit, driving under the influence of alcohol, allowing
  another person to drive your vehicle under the influence of
  alcohol. In the region of £5,000 of parking fees owing, £6,000 of
  damage to property. Charges of assault and abuse - the charges of
  attempted murder and robbery have been dropped. Shoplifting...
Patsy: [to judge] My name is Patsy Stone. I'm an alcoholic, and what
  she did was an act of humanitarian mercy.
Judge: That is hardly a reason to steal a crate of champagne.
Eddie: Have you any idea how much champagne costs these days? I was
  forced to steal it. My daughter wouldn't have allowed me to buy it.
Judge: I must ask you to sit down as stop wasting the court's time.
  The sum of £50,000 is to be paid by you in damages, and a further
  fine of £2,000. You will also be liable for all cost incurred.
Eddie: [to Saffron] Well, getting rid of my chauffeur was a little
  bit of a falso economy, wasn't it sweetie?
Judge: ...and a lifetime ban on driving. And, finally, Mrs.
  Monsoon...
Eddie: Can I just say one word in my defense, um?
Saffie: I don't think that's a very good idea, Mum. Your mouth is
  working for the prosecution.
Eddie: Oh, darling, this is what I do well, sweetie. You might pick
  up a few tips for the Debating Society, you never know. Without
  notes, Saff.
[Gran claps]
Eddie: Thank you, thank you.
[to judge]
Eddie: Right - I, the proposed accused, think that, well, I mean, you
  know, well the day in question was not a good day for me, all
  right? But I put it to you that I don't see how any day could have
  been good the way this bloody country's run. Well, you know, I was
  just trying to do my best, trying to get from A to B, do a little
  shopping. I was trying to take control of my life, you know, only
  to find that it's actually controlled for me by petty bureaucracy
  and bits of bloody paper - ignorant bloody petty rules and laws
  that just obstruct every tiny little action until you've committed
  a crime without even knowing it! I mean, you know, why can't life
  just be made a little easier for everybody, eh? Why can't it be
  more like the Continent, and then run down the street in front of
  charging bulls whilst letting fireworks off out of his bloody
  nostrils without anyone blinking an eye? Uh? Because it's probably
  a local holiday and nobody's at work because they all want to have
  just a little bit of fun and they're not intimidated by some
  outdated work ethic. I mean, there has to be more to life than just
  being safe...
Judge: Is there a point to all of this?
Eddie: [explaining to the judge her problems with the law] Yes,
  Yes!... Why, oh why, do we pay taxes, hmmm? I mean, just to have
  bloody parking restrictions- and BUGGERY-UGLY traffic wardens, and
  BOLLOCKY-pedestrian-BLOODY-crossings?... and those BASTARD railings
  outside shops windows, making it so difficult, so you can't even
  get in them! I mean, I know they're there to stop stupid people
  running into the street and killing themselves! But we're not all
  stupid! We don't all need nurse-maiding. I mean, why not just have
  a Stupidity Tax? Just tax the stupid people!
Patsy: [stands up] And let them DIE!
Eddie: Yes!
Judge: Anymore of this ridiculous rant, and I'll put you both away!
Gran: Hear, hear!
Judge: Edina Margaret Rose Monsoon, I hereby sentence you to...
[Credits roll]

Patsy: [running into the kitchen holding four cigarettes] LIGHT!
  LIGHT! LIGHT!

  coming these days.
Patsy: Bloody bastard asthmatic cab driver!

Patsy: Go for it, Eddie!

[first lines]
Eddie: Sorry I was so long, darling. Had to clear out my wardrobe.
  All those horrible, revolting, unfashionable clothes that I simply
  would not wear, darling, because they are not in fashion. I put
  them in a pile on the floor to throw out.
Gran: I thought you put them on, dear.
Eddie: [about Gran] What's that doing here?

Eddie: These are new! Tell her, Saffy, darling. The seventies are
  back!
Gran: Oh, does that mean you'll be voting Labour again, dear?

Eddie: [about the No Smoking cab] I hope you refused to pay him this
  time darling.
Patsy: It was one of your account cabs, Eds. I think you should get
  him fired.
Saffie: Oh, so not only do you want the man to die of passive
  smoking, but you also want to deny him a living of any kind.
Eddie: Passive smo- I suppose we're shortening your life, are we,
  darling?
Patsy: If only.

Eddie: Just get out.
Saffie: Bye Gran.
Gran: Goodbye, dear. Ooh by the way, if you do hit hard times and
  there is anything you need to sell, my friend Hermione has this
  little shop.
Eddie: Bric n' Brac 'n' Knick 'n' Knack - any old things. Any old
  junk taken. Why don't you trade yourself in? Get out, go.
Gran: She'd give you a very good price, dear.
Eddie: Oh, just leave!

Eddie: [about the Nicotine patches on Patsy's back] They're actually,
  most of these seem alright darling. They're leaching something out
  of your skin rather than the other way around.
Saffie: She's probably recharging them.
Patsy: Careful Eddie. Don't rip so hard.
Saffie: Yes, be careful. At her age the flesh slides off the bone
  like a well-cooked chicken.
Eddie: For your information, there are some people who'd pay a lot of
  money for Patsy's body.
Saffie: Morticians. How much do you think you'd get for a
  ready-embalmed carcass? No wonder she's always been refused a donor
  card.

Eddie: [to Saffy] Whose side are you on? Do you want us to be poor?
Patsy: You'll be poor...?
Saffie: That's got you worried.
Patsy: Eddie, we simply cannot allow them to cut us off like this.
  Now, listen, sweetie, it is not alimony, it is compensation.
Saffie: For what?
Eddie: It's damages, sweetie, for those long crippling hours of
  painful labour I went through on your behalf.
Saffie: You had a Caesarean.
Eddie: Yes, I know I had a Caesarean, darling but... how do you think
  it feels to wake up every morning and look down and see your
  stomach still smiling back up at her, hmm? You can't put a price on
  that!

Eddie: [to Bubble] Bubble! Wake up, Bubble! Come on! Wake up,
  darling! Oh, it's like tea-break on the Thunderbirds set. Somebody
  operate her, please!

Bubble: I turned on the... hmm... what-cha-ma-call-it this morning...
Saffie: Radio?
Bubble: I want to say "telephone"... That's not right... Not right...
  [going through possibilities in her head] You look at it.
Eddie: Television!
Bubble: That's it! Good Morning Television. Hello! Which I don't
  normally do because I find myself falling back to sleep like that.
Patsy: Good Morning, Television? My God! If they could market that in
  pill form, Switzerland would be plunged into a recession.

Eddie: [to Saffy] Have you any idea what the government do to
  unemployed people, darling? They are forced to do community
  service! Putting loft insulation into urine-stinking old people's
  homes for the incontinent!

Eddie: I'm not like Saffy, I can't walk around looking like a...
Patsy: ...A stale old piece of toast.
Eddie: Exactly. It takes more than a cold flannel and some Body Shop
  oatmeal scrub for me, you know. And I can't meet clients smelling
  like an old bowl of porridge, can I, sweetie? These are valid
  business expenses.

Malcolm: I am doing everything I can within the law.
Eddie: Oh God, well what on earth is the point of having an
  accountant if he's within the law? I might as well do it myself. In
  face, I think I will. Write him off.

Saffie: Malcolm and I just frightened her into slimming things down a
  little bit.
Justin: Oh, she's not a good slimmer, sweetie. I mean she could eat
  air and put on weight.
Saffie: Yes, well I intend to keep her thinking she's poor for a
  while. It mat cut out the worst of her excesses.

Eddie: Business, business! That's my flowers - thats business.
Malcolm: Pedicure and nose plugging?
Eddie: Busin... Don't, don't look at me like that! It is very
  important for business for me to look good, and looking good costs
  money!

Saffie: I lived with you and that piece of flint! You dragged me up!
  I've lived in such worlds I should have known nothing about! Worlds
  with no morals and no responsibilities! And not just glimpsed- you
  took my face with your four hands and pushed it up against the
  window!
Patsy: We should have pushed it through!

Saffie: [to Eddie] You burnt and scared my best friend!
Patsy: Who?
Eddie: Titicaca.
Patsy: Oh.
Saffie: Her name is Sarah!
Eddie: Darling, she was standing with her little pigtails too close
  to a candle!
Patsy: Act of God!
Saffie: You were holding the candle!

Eddie: [to Saffy] I know the kind of little play you will have

  Pooh".

  in some dental floss and call it an outfit... You don't wanna WHAP
  your fanny out of the prim! Just slither your tits out of the back
  of a taxi, I mean they're just mags, sweetheart. They're just mags.

Cat: Cat burglar. Because, I used to run the whole job - case the
  mark, make the hit and fence the mechandise.
Krissie Valentine: One stop shopping.

[Ashley thinks that Cat is too cocky for a solo mission]
Mike Savage: Let me tell you something about cocky. When I used to
  fight, I had to go in the ring every time knowing I was going to
  win that fight - knowing there was no way I could lose the fight.
  I'll tell you right now, half the fight is attitude and Cat has the
  right attitude.

Mike Savage: Okay, Catherine's a translator, so if they test you with
  languages can you handle it?
Cat: Are you kidding? I dated Pierre for a year, Luigi for two years
  and spent the worst four weeks of my life with Boris the Russian
  from hell.
Krissie Valentine: Well, it's certainly cheaper than Berlitz.
Cat: And a whole lot more effective.

[Cat is captured after she discovers heroine being packaged for

Arthur Small: Men like Steinholtz take men who are hungry and aimless
  and desperate and he gives them something to hate. Never
  underestimate the power of organized hate.

Cat: Your job must be so exciting!
Frederica Fluke: Actually, my job is to keep things not exciting.

Werner Steinholtz: My friends, now is the time to take action with
  our hatred of the state this world has reached. The twisted
  brotherhood of democracy has ended.

Werner Steinholtz: The Fourth Reich lives!

Arthur Small: Marcus, it wasn't just Jews who died because of Hitler.

  are born before they kidnap them?
Ashley Hunter-Coddington: Babies already born are more easily traced:
  birthmarks are recorded, footprints and photographs are taken.
  Kidnapping the mother and forcing labor makes it much harder to
  find the child later. Officially, the child doesn't even exist.
Mike Savage: And I suppose there's a lot of money in this, too?

Ashley Hunter-Coddington: Everyone has access to intuition - it's not
  exclusive to women. It's just that generally women are more in
  touch with their emotions, so they're more open to receiving subtle
  impressions.

Catherine 'Cat' Avery Pascal): Whoever said you were better than
  Ashley was scoring in the wrong categories.

[Suarez's thugs throw down their guns when Arthur plays a recording
  of police sirens]
Mike Savage: Hey, Arthur, I thought you only liked disco.
Arthur Small: It's classical, actually, but under the circumstances I
  thought this might do.

[Mike turns and shoots Suarez, who was hiding in ambush in a closet]
Mike Savage: I guess I'm catching on to this feminine intuition
  stuff.
Ashley Hunter-Coddington: Yes, I'm sure it wasn't a lucky guess.

Peter Dragon: If it's yellow, let it mellow, if it's brown, let's
  flush it down, people!

Peter Dragon: Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill him.
Stuart Glazer: I think you get fined by the Writers Guild. [pause]
  But it's only 2500.

Wendy Ward: Adam, do you know what I used to do?
Adam Rafkin: You were a prostitute.
Wendy Ward: Adam, do you know what a two-fingered Mexican oil job is?
Adam Rafkin: No.
Wendy Ward: I do. Do you know what a double-knobbed rubber-bottom
  sex-basket is?
Adam Rafkin: No.
Wendy Ward: I own one, Adam. Adam, have you ever had a Dominican
  face-hat?
Adam Rafkin: No.
Wendy Ward: Of course you haven't. Cause I'm one of only six people
  in the world who knows how to do it, and Adam, when you get to page
  80 I will do it *to you*.

Wendy Ward: I'm even gonna throw in the incredibly difficult reverse
  ceiling squad, which normally requires a permission slip from a
  cardiologist.

Beverly Hills Savings Executive: This film is based around a madman
  with an arsenal of automatic weapons savagely slaughtering zoo
  animals.
Stuart Glazer: Yes, it's sort of a cross between Dr. Dolittle and
  Apocalypse Now.
Peter Dragon: Yeah, you get the kids *and* the parents.
Beverly Hills Savings Executive: I'll tell you what, Peter. I'll give
  you the 50 million. If you promise to put our credit in big bold
  letters over that final shot of the dying baby panda bubbling blood
  out of his sucking chest wound.

Uncle Lonnie: You gotta think positive. Like when I lost my right
  testicle I could've *really* been depressed. But I wasn't.
Peter Dragon: Congratulations.
Uncle Lonnie: You know, I get out of the shower every morning, I look
  down and I say: That sack is half *full*!

Peter Dragon: If writing's hard, how come Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
  have Oscars?

Peter Dragon: I was a writer myself, I wrote all my early movies.
Adam Rafkin: Action comedies?
Peter Dragon: Gay porno.

Adam Rafkin: [Peter is strangling Adam] I'm sorry, I have a - I have
  writers block!
Peter Dragon: Oh, you have block huh? [grabs something] How 'bout I
  unblock you with this people's choice award?

Peter Dragon: I may have to lay a few people off, oh yeah, I don't
  wanna name any names, but for those of you ladies that, eh,
  routinely mistake a hand in the blouse for sexual harassment, you
  might wanna call that bitch Gloria Albright and get her off my ass.


# "Action" (1999) {Blowhard (#1.4)}
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: Peter, as a partner, I want to be consulted on
  these decisions.
Peter Dragon: Well, let me ask you a question. Do I tell you how to
  go to a bus station, pick up a teenage girl, and turn her into a
  prostitute? No.

Peter Dragon: How are we gonna cast the part of the seeing eye dog?
  Stuart, that can't be everybody, who's the hot young dog in town
  now?
Stuart Glazer: Well, there's the Taco Bell dog, red hot. [Peter looks
  disapprovingly] That dog on Frasier is doing some really terrific
  work, but who knows if that will translate on the big screen and,
  eh, well obviously Disney has about 101 dogs that are looking for
  work.
Uncle Lonnie: 102, counting Glen Close.
Peter Dragon: You're both wrong. Disney put all those dogs down when
  the film wrapped.
Stuart Glazer: Really? They're so efficient.

Sandra Bullock: [kicking Peter as he crawls onto his couch] You wanna
  explain this tape?
Peter Dragon: What tape, what are you talking about?
Sandra Bullock: Eh, 'Sandra Buttocks in While you were sleeping... on
  my face' [angrilly puts tape in VHS player]
Peter Dragon: Wait, you think I had something to do with that?
Sandra Bullock: My dad bought it yesterday on your website.

Sandra Bullock: [audio from Peter and Sandra's sex tape] Oi, puppy,
  yeah! Peter, can't we just turn off some of these lights?
Peter Dragon: No! No, I need the lights.
Sandra Bullock: Okay, okay.
Peter Dragon: I wanna see every inch of your beautiful body...
Sandra Bullock: Oh yeah.
Peter Dragon: ...Sandra Bullock.
Sandra Bullock: Oh, Peter, we're making love, just call me Sandie.
Peter Dragon: Okay, Sandie... [quietly] Bullock... of Speed.
Sandra Bullock: Oh yeah, faster! More speed!

Adam Rafkin: [Adam is in hospital suffering from exhaustion] Today is
  the first day I'm been able to drink out of a bendy straw, so...
Peter Dragon: [feigning interest] Really? Hey, there you go you're on
  the road to wellsville. You ever see that movie, Road to
  Wellsville?
Peter Dragon: No, who's in it?
Adam Rafkin: Lara Flyn Boyle's breasts, hmm.
Adam Rafkin: I'll rent it.
Peter Dragon: You won't be disappointed.

Peter Dragon: I swear to God, if self involved braindead chimps ever
  form a union, it's gonna be 98 % actors.
Wendy Ward: I think they have, it's called Screen Actors Guild.

Peter Dragon: [desperate to keep Cole Riccardi from coming out of the
  closet] Well, Cole, the truth of the matter is, and eh... I'm
  trusting you with my life here... I too, eh, am a friend of
  Dorothy's.
Cole Riccardi: Peter, what do you take me for? What about that tape
  of you and Sandra Bullock?
Peter Dragon: She's the one that drove me to men! Don't make me
  relive it, Cole.
Cole Riccardi: I know, cause I've been there. For me it was Carrie
  Fisher.

Peter Dragon: Is that my goat?
Momo Shabong: No, that's Bobby G.'s goat.
Peter Dragon: That looks just like my goat.
Momo Shabong: Everybody I like gets a goat.
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: I didn't get a goat.

Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: Momo.
Momo Shabong: Yes?
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: My goat?
Momo Shabong: You shame me. The truth is, I am out of goats. Now I
  must kill myself. [draws dagger]
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: Ho!
Robert 'Bobby G.' Gianopolis: Heyheyheyheyheyheyhey!
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: It's ok, my friend.
Robert 'Bobby G.' Gianopolis: We'll share the goat.
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: We'll share the goat.


# "Action" (1999) {Dead Man Floating (#1.11)}
[first lines]
Jane Dragon Gianopolis: [reading] I, Peter Dragon, being of sound
  mind and body, declare that this is my last will and testament.
Peter Dragon: What are you doing?
Jane Dragon Gianopolis: Ah! Oh my god! Peter! You're not dead!
Peter Dragon: What happened to me?
Jane Dragon Gianopolis: You had a heart attack. The doctor said you
  were legally dead. You were legally dead!

Peter Dragon: You know what, I'm changing my whole will right now.
  I'm leaving everything I have to... Larry Flynt.

Peter Dragon: How're you doing, I'm Peter Dragon. I'm a millionaire.
  I produce movies. And I wanna thank all you gas station attendants
  and plumbers for reproducing. That's... nice. You're doing a great
  job, plumbers and gas station attendants. Keep up the good work.

Peter Dragon: You call those the breasts of a grown-up? I've seen
  better jugs in Schindler's List.

Peter Dragon: When I was 13 years old, I saw my first R-rated movie,
  Barbarella, and in the opening sequence, Jane Fonda took out two of
  the most beautiful ripe melons that this old farm boy ever did see.
  But they're gone now. Because of time, aging, gravity, and that
  dirty old bird Ted Turner pulling on them night after night. They
  don't exist! They're gone! But I still have the memories of those
  breasts. Beautiful breasts, that can turn a 13-year-old boy into a
  13-year-old man.

Jenny: I'll have all of Hollywood's a-list c-cups in your office by
  two o'clock.

Titus Scroad: Every night, he and I sit down with the big book.
Peter Dragon: The Bible?
Titus Scroad: Moby Dick.

Peter Dragon: Six-hundred-dollar piece of shit! Swim, you fuck, swim!

Uncle Lonnie: How do we know he's really dead? Usually, when someone
  dies, they crap themselves and the stuff floats up. Now h... Never
  mind. There's the mother load, it's hooked underneath.

Peter Dragon: I am the mommy!

Jane Dragon Gianopolis: Are you serious?
Peter Dragon: I'm serious as a heart attack.

Peter Dragon: Take it easy, you're pretty critical for a man who a
  guy that humps a sweat sock.
Adam Rafkin: [awkward laugh] He's kidding.
Peter Dragon: Not kidding.

Peter Dragon: [on cellphone] Look Bobby, I think this kid Holden has
  got a real problem, he's killing other people now, the next thing
  he's gonna kill himself, you know, I think maybe it's time we
  recast and put the kid in rehab.


# "Action" (1999) {Dragon's Blood (#1.7)}
Holden Van Dorn: Mr. Scrotum.
Peter Dragon: Scroad.
Holden Van Dorn: Scrote, it is an honor to meet you. I want you to
  know that your movie 'Bone Field' changed my life, man. And I've
  been waiting 15 years for your next movie, where've ya been, man?
Titus Scroad: I've been to hell and back, son. For the past 12 years
  I've been on a downward spiral of drug and alcohol addiction that
  didn't stop untill I found myself in Mexico, making mad passionate
  love with Glen Close.
Peter Dragon: Hey, that doesn't sound too bad there, partner.
Titus Scroad: Well, yeah, but unfortunately it was a Mr. Glen Close,
  who was an antique refinisher in Orange County.

Peter Dragon: I'll tell you what, why don't we go across the lot and
  I'll show you the tank where Leonardo DiCaprio drowned.
Georgia Dragon: I don't understand why he just didn't hold on to the
  fat girl.
Peter Dragon: You're so cute.

Uncle Lonnie: How's your mother?
Hot Dog Vendor: We lost her three weeks ago, Lonnie. Doctor said it
  was, eh...
Georgia Dragon: [interrupting] Excuse me, this has sour crout. I
  distinctly said no sour crout. Do you have a hearing problem, or is
  it some kind of age related short term memory thingie?

Peter Dragon: Alright, What's the first rule of producing?
Georgia Dragon: Never invest you're own money. There's plenty of
  suckers out there.
Peter Dragon: What's the second?
Georgia Dragon: No pirate movies.
Peter Dragon: Third?
Georgia Dragon: Ehm...
Uncle Lonnie: Explosions, boobs, explosions. It used to be boobs,
  explosions, boobs, but women have advanced a long way.

Peter Dragon: [to his daughter] Oh, hey, you wanna see a movie, it's
  directed by some chinaman, it's a, it's good, I don't know, what's
  the title of it?
Wendy Ward: Pussycat lips, pussycat whips, bang bang pussycat,
  pussycat dies.
Georgia Dragon: Is it P.G.?
Wendy Ward: I don't think so.

Adam Rafkin: [tasked to help Georgia with her book report] You know,
  when I was a little boy, I had to do my own reports.
Georgia Dragon: So you should be really good at this!


# "Action" (1999) {Lights, Camera, Action! (#1.10)}
Peter Dragon: Life is filled with things that you just can't predict.
  Ned Beatty goes on a rafting trip in "Deliverance," winds up
  getting sodomized by hillbillies. Eddie Murphy stops to give a girl
  a ride home, turns out she has a bigger schlong than he does. One
  night you go out for McDonald's and accidentally hack your ex-wife
  and Ron Goldman to death. These things happen. The point is that
  things can change 180 degrees in a split second.

Holden Van Dorn: Caleb... Caleb is more like a... he's like a... he's
  like a lobster. You know? Like, low to the ground, moves on his own
  time, he's got a hard shell, he hates butter. Stuff like that.

Peter Dragon: Hey, what's this? You're hiding donuts in your pocket?
Reagan Lauren Busch: No... this isn't my jacket.
Peter Dragon: This isn't your jack- We had this made for you, it has
  your name on it.
Reagan Lauren Busch: Well then they made it with the donut in it.
Peter Dragon: What?

Stuart Glazer: [to Jenny] I don't think you understand my stature
  around here.
Stuart Glazer: Hey, worthless!
Peter Dragon: Yes?

Holden Van Dorn: I am the star, Peter, I'm the star! [shouting] I
  have to have the bigger codpiece!
Peter Dragon: Yeah, I read that in Laurence Olivier's book 'Acting
  with your crotch'.
Holden Van Dorn: Who the fuck is Laurence Olivier?
Peter Dragon: Exactly.

Peter Dragon: [shouting] Get him up on the catwalk and get him on the
  damn rope! I want him hanging from that rope faster than O.J. at a
  clan rally.

Paramedic #1: Okay, let's get the paperwork done. What's the T.O.D.?
Paramedic #2: I'll check. Time of death: 9.30, Thursday night. [as
  the first paramedic notes it down] Hey, this is a nice watch.


# "Action" (1999) {Love Sucks (#1.8)}
Peter Dragon: I started out the way I always start a film: having sex
  with a whore.

Peter Dragon: And I just wanna tell you that if it does turn out like
  Slow Torture, I'm cutting you loose. You'll spend the rest of your
  life in Vancouver making Meatballs sequels with John Landis. I hope
  you like Jim Belushi and David Spade, cause you're gonna be seeing
  a lot of them.
Peter Dragon: Wow, somebody woke up on the wrong side of JM J.
  Bullock this morning.
Robert 'Bobby G.' Gianopolis: I like JM J. Bullock.

Blood & Piss Guy: He's gonna get the best blood money can buy: Amish.
Peter Dragon: How do you get Amish blood?
Blood & Piss Guy: Traps.

Peter Dragon: I lost track of time. You know how I get when I'm
  shopping for urine.

Peter Dragon: It's really weird: usually I have a girlfriend and I
  make pretend she's a whore, but with you it's completely the
  opposite: I have a whore and I make pretend she's you're my
  girlfriend.
Wendy Ward: Wow, look what's passing for a compliment these days.

Peter Dragon: Hi Mr. Van Dorn, you ready to knock Keanu off the top
  of the hill?
Holden Van Dorn: Yes. Yes I am, ready as a hoot-owl.
Peter Dragon: Are you sober? Any magic powder floating around in
  there?
Holden Van Dorn: No, no, I am sober as an ox.
Peter Dragon: Sober as an ox? [smiles] You went to school in the
  studios, didn't you?
Holden Van Dorn: Yeah, since, eh sixth grade.
Peter Dragon: Yeah, I can tell, you're smart as a duck.

Peter Dragon: [Stuart is hiding from Peter in a bathroom stall]
  Stuart, get out of the stall, Stuart, I know you're in there!
Stuart Glazer: No... You'll hurt me.
Peter Dragon: Yes, I will hurt you. But you know what, If I hurt you,
  then at least one of us will feel better.
Stuart Glazer: She still has a very pretty face.
Peter Dragon: Oh she has a face? I didn't notice 'cause unfortunately
  it's on top of the body of Brian Dennehy!

Dr. Wong: Okay, Dr. Wong gonna cut to chase: this girl very fat.
  Maybe 45, 50 more than you want her to be, right? [Lauren whimpers]
  Legally I cannot suck that much fat out of her unless she's obese
  like Roseanne or that fattie from Practice.
Reagan Lauren Busch: Camryn Manheim?
Dr. Wong: Yes, she's fat!

Dr. Wong: [picks up phone] Yeah?
Peter Dragon: [on tiny cellphone] She'll be there in an hour.
Dr. Wong: You want 35, 45 off?
Peter Dragon: 50 pounds. And nothing from the breasts.
Dr. Wong: It hurt like hell.
Peter Dragon: I don't care. [both hang up]

David Leisure: Off the record, Peter, what would you do if this one
  tanks too, like Slow Torture did?
Peter Dragon: I'd kill myself. Or do TV, I don't know which one's
  worse.
David Leisure: What would you do on TV?
Peter Dragon: I would do a show about eh, hell, I'd do a TV show
  about me. That'd be interesting, huh? A TV show about a Hollywood
  producer, morally corrupt, nobody likes him. I, I, I'd have
  cursing, sexual content, I'd have guest stars running in and out,
  I'd be a big hit. All you'd have to do is find the right time slot.


# "Action" (1999) {Mr. Dragon Goes to Washington (#1.5)}
Senator Powell: Now you are perilously close to being cited for
  contempt, Mister Dragon!
Peter Dragon: I'm already in contempt! I'm in contempt of all you old
  whores and hypocrites! At least I'm giving the American people what
  they want!
Senator Powell: And just exactly what is it that you think they want?
Peter Dragon: I'll tell "yew" exactly what they want, Senator: they
  want chase scenes and car crashes! They want firm breasts and
  tight-assed Latino men! They want their cowboys to be strong and
  silent. They want their cops to bend the rules to get the job done.
  They want the boy to get the girl. They want the alien to be
  killed... unless he's cute. They want the good guy to win. They
  want the bad guy to die, hopefully in the biggest explosion the
  budget will allow. But most importantly, Senator, they want to walk
  into a theater and for ninety minutes be able to forget about the
  fucking mess you have left of this nation.

Senator: Mr. Dragon, you have a young daughter, do you not?
Peter Dragon: Let's not go there...
Senator: Her name is Georgia, she's about 10 years old I believe.
Peter Dragon: Don't do this.
Senator: Has little Georgia seen your film entitled "Ripcord"?
Peter Dragon: She can't get in Senator, it's rated R.
Senator: Which contains 357 acts of violence, 175 profanities, and
  four scenes of lesbian sex. She proud of her daddy for that one?
Wendy Ward: I think we should just go.
Senator: How can you look that sweet little girl in the eye?
Peter Dragon: I manage. I never voted to subsidize the growing of
  tobacco, while turning my back on food programs for starving kids.
  I've never vetoed a gun control bill; all MY guns are fake,
  Senator. I've never rushed to the defense of Kuwaiti oil fields,
  while ignoring genocide in Africa, because big oil companies that
  line your fat pockets aren't concerned with black Africa. Those are
  all productions of YOUR company Senator, this company right here!

Peter Dragon: Listen to these numbers: In 1987, 95% of all on-screen
  homicidal maniacs were played by white males. Whereas last year,
  50% of on-screen homicidal maniacs were played by blacks, women,
  and Puerto Ricans. I, sir, am very proud of those numbers and their
  progress.

Connie Hunt: Nobody loves you, Peter. That means that you're gonna
  have to do something very public, very generous, and totally
  altruistic.
Peter Dragon: Public and generous I can do, altruistic I'm not so
  sure about.
Connie Hunt: Why not?
Peter Dragon: I don't know what that means.

Peter Dragon: Welcome. Thank you all for coming to the grand opening
  of the Peter Dragon Camp for Pediatric German Measles. Kids with
  measles, why do they fall through the cracks? And these aren't
  ordinary measles, people, these are *German* measles. *German*. We
  all know what that means, they're highly organized, they're
  efficient, and they're brutal. German measles will not stop their
  path of destruction until somebody stand up to them and says: Never
  again! Well, I, Peter Dragon, am here today to say: *Never again*!

Stuart Glazer: Hey Peter, what are we helping to cure?
Peter Dragon: Nothing, Stuart, these are rich white people, they are
  here for their own egos, they're hypocrites. Look on the necklace
  on Candy Spelling, you'd rip that off her neck, you could cure
  *death*.

Peter Dragon: I'm gonna get violence off the streets and back where
  it belongs: in the movies.

Peter Dragon: Honey, give me a break. Was what I did really that bad?
Connie Hunt: You called five of the most powerful men in America 'old
  whores' and then you told the rest of the country they were only
  interested in Stallone movies and oral sex.
Peter Dragon: Yeah well, I was obviously kidding, nobody cares about
  Stallone movies.

David Hasselhoff: Come on folks, who wants to strap their kids in a
  teacup with Michael?

Stuart Glazer: God, I'm stuffed. They put out so much food at these
  things. Celebrities eat like pigs.
Wendy Ward: I know. Hey, I just saw half the cast of Friends throwing
  up in the ladies room.
Stuart Glazer: Shut up!

David Hasselhoff: Next up: ordinary corn holders. That is if you
  consider Mary Tyler Moore's cornhole ordinary. [catches himself]
  Cornholders. I mean cornholders.


# "Action" (1999) {One Easy Piece (#1.12)}
Peter Dragon: A hundred thousand dollars and I get to see her nipple?
Bernie Beckerman: Peter, for a hundred thousand dollars you can cram
  the camera up her ass for all I care.

Peter Dragon: My foot - get up, Stuart - is gonna be so far up your
  ass, that a piece of my ass might actually be in your ass!

Stuart Glazer: They wanna make me Head of Comedy.
Peter Dragon: Head of Comedy? What do you know about comedy?
Stuart Glazer: Nothing. But I'm gay.

Jenny: [to Reagan] Your crotch has had more visitors than Graceland.

Peter Dragon: Rafkin. You just killed a man.
Adam Rafkin: I'm sorry.
Peter Dragon: No. No. That's fantastic! You did it. You're a producer
  now. You did it!

Peter Dragon: Stuart, put your pants on and get the hell out of here.
  [to Bernie and Reagan] Hey, how many times do you think he heard
  that sentence, huh?

Peter Dragon: Okay, Stuart, look, there is an enormous difference
  between movies and television. You know what that difference is?
Stuart Glazer: No...
Peter Dragon: Okay, let's take a look at my rolodex, okay? I'll be
  the movie, you be the TV rolodex. In my movie rolodex I have, eh,
  Sean Connery. Your TV rolodex? Shawn Wayans. Eh? Marlon Brando,
  Marlon Wayans. Alec Baldwin, Alec... eh... Wayans. There's probably
  one floating around, I don't know.

Reagan Lauren Busch: [locked in her trailer] Holden Van Dorn is a big
  homo!
Peter Dragon: [standing outside talking to the trailer door] Why do
  you think Holden's a homo? I mean, I know why I think Holden's a
  homo, but why do you think he's a homo?
Reagan Lauren Busch: Peter, he couldn't even get it up during the
  love scene.
Peter Dragon: Homo. Well, in his defense, eh, you know, it's acting,
  Reagan. So, maybe, you know, he's just acting he has an erection.
Reagan Lauren Busch: Well I don't care what he's supposed to act
  like. I mean it's a common courtesy.

Peter Dragon: What's your problem?
Holden Van Dorn: Eh, I can't get... I can't get little Keanu to stand
  at attention.

Adam Rafkin: [intimidating a caterer] Don't answer me when I ask you
  something.


# "Action" (1999) {Pilot (#1.1)}
Manny Sanchez: [Peter parks his car in the Employee of the Month
  parking space] Hi, I'm Manny Sanchez, from the commissary, and I'm
  the Employee of the Month.
Peter Dragon: Well that's fantastic, Manny. What is that, some kind
  of award for not peeing in the cob salads?
Manny Sanchez: I never pee in the cob salads.
Peter Dragon: Really? That's too bad, because if I was you, I would
  have peed in the cob salads. In fact, I would have peed in every
  fuckin' cob salad every fuckin' day so every one of those
  cocksuckers in that commissary would have had a taste of Peter
  fuckin' Dragon. But you know what, Manny? That's just me. Move.
Manny Sanchez: You're Peter Dragon?
Peter Dragon: Yeah, I'm Peter Dragon. That's right. And while you've
  admirably restrained yourself over the years from peeing in the cob
  salads, I've made ten motion pictures that have earned this studio
  a billion dollars. So I'm gonna continue to park wherever the fuck
  I want because, unfortunately for you, I am Employee of the fucking
  Century! Congratulations on your award, though. Your parents must
  be very proud.

Peter Dragon: We bought the wrong script?
Stuart Glazer: Well, we've bought crappy scripts before.
Peter Dragon: Yeah, but that was on purpose! Okay, how much did we
  pay Mr. "Is-there-gonna-be-a-party-afterwards?"
Peter Dragon: I have no idea. Not very much, I'm sure.
Gina: Two hundred and fifty thousand.
Peter Dragon: What? Hey, Stuart, look at me. Are you telling me we
  spent a quarter of a million dollars and we got the wrong Jew? What
  are you thinking? A quarter mil for Adam Rafkin. Adam Rafkin
  couldn't write his name in the snow with his dick!

Peter Dragon: I'm really looking forward to us working together.
Keanu Reeves: Peter, I have some concerns.
Peter Dragon: Well, I'd like to hear about them.
Keanu Reeves: I'm a little concerned that your date has her hand down
  my pants.
Wendy Ward: I'm a big fan.
Keanu Reeves: Why, thank you. I'm getting to be a pretty big fan of
  yours, too.

Peter Dragon: Look, Stuart, go in the men's room right now, sit in a
  stall, and see if you can hear the buzz on the picture.
Stuart Glazer: Jesus, Peter, I'm the president of production. Make
  Gina do it.
Peter Dragon: I don't care what they're saying in the ladies' room. I
  have Harvey Keitel pummeling Wynona Ryder's face with a tire iron.
  It's not exactly a woman's film!

Adam Rafkin: [At Bobby G's beach front Christmas party] Hi, it's me,
  Adam Rafkin. Merry Christmas. This is funny that we're running into
  each other like this. What did you think of my script. Did you...?
Peter Dragon: Rafkin, I'm trying to celebrate the birth of Christ
  with my family, and... hundreds of beautiful, young, gay men. How
  dare you come here on the holiest of days and crap on our Christmas
  with talk of show business?
Stuart Glazer: [Stuart walks up in a speedo] Peter.
Peter Dragon: Stuart, what are you doing here?
Stuart Glazer: I have a *life.*

Wendy Ward: I hated the stupid music, I thought it flat out sucked!
Stuart Glazer: It's electronic.
Wendy Ward: Yeah, so's my vibrator. But I don't have to sit in a
  chair and listen to it for an hour and a half.
Stuart Glazer: Who the hell are you?
Peter Dragon: She's my prostitute.
Stuart Glazer: [stuttering] She's your whore?
Peter Dragon: No, she's my prostitute. You're my whore.

Peter Dragon: Listen to me, she can come to the pre-premiere party,
  she can come to the premiere, she can come to the post-premiere
  party, but she cannot come to the post-premiere party party. What
  do you mean, why?. Because she's ugly!

Peter Dragon: The head of security is sleeping on a couch. Get him a
  blanket!
Uncle Lonnie: And a bagel.
Peter Dragon: And a bagel!

Wendy Ward: Hey, you want a date?
Peter Dragon: I'm gonna puke on you.
Wendy Ward: Gee, I don't think I have a price for that.

Peter Dragon: Don't talk about the music. Everybody knows, when your
  friends don't like your movie and they can't think of anything nice
  to say they talk about the music.

Cole Riccardi: You're yanking me, you're Wendy Ward?
Wendy Ward: Yeah, yeah.
Stuart Glazer: Who?
Cole Riccardi: Wendy Ward, schmuck. My God, 'Elephant Princess' was
  huge, every boy in America dreamed of being with Wendy Ward.
Uncle Lonnie: And now that dream has almost come true.
Wendy Ward: Easy...

Peter Dragon: You know I'm really sorry you had to see Bruce Willis
  behave like that.
Wendy Ward: Oh, please, It's okay. I just hope the cat is alright.


# "Action" (1999) {Re-Enter the Dragon (#1.2)}
Wendy Ward: I really like how even though I'm a hooker you don't
  treat me like a hooker.
Peter Dragon: Thank you.
Wendy Ward: You're welcome. Here's your bill.
Peter Dragon: All right. It's a pretty impressive group of documents
  you've got here.
Wendy Ward: Thank you. I've got Windows 98.
Uncle Lonnie: You know, she was very helpful around the house.
  Especially those times when you overdosed in your own vomit you
  know.
Wendy Ward: Thanks, Lonnie. See, I kept extensive notes of all of our
  activities, and then I itemized. See I broke it into different...
  straight, and there are oral, and others.
Peter Dragon: You definitely broke it down three ways.
Wendy Ward: Oh, that reminds me. I forgot about the tree-ways. Now,
  you know what, what the hell, I just throw those in, on the house.
Peter Dragon: Oh, I hope so, I never even *touched* a guy.

Peter Dragon: Look, Wendy, I want you to come work for me. Not as a
  prostitute, no, no, no. I want you to work for me as a motion
  picture executive, which is just a different kind of prostitute.

Peter Dragon: Wendy, I trust you. You complete me.
Wendy Ward: I hate it when people try to pass off movie dialogue and
  use it in real conversation!
Peter Dragon: Well frankly, Wendy, I don't give a damn.

Peter Dragon: You can be a prostitute and humiliate yourself as a
  job, or you can work as a motion picture executive and humiliate
  yourself as a career!

Stuart Glazer: What if we cut the scene where the street gang sets
  fire to the Beverly Hills Hotel, rapes the supermodel, and plucks
  out her left eye? Hm?
Adam Rafkin: Oh, come on! Are you kidding me? That's the funniest
  scene in the picture!
Peter Dragon: Thank you!
Stuart Glazer: True, but it always bothered me, I mean, a supermodel
  running around the rest of the picture with an eye patch.
Peter Dragon: I don't agree. Deformity's sexy. I picture Drew
  Barrymore with, like, an eye patch, a club foot, maybe a lisp.
  Well, she *has* a lisp, but quite frankly, the whole picture gives
  me an erection.
Wendy Ward: Yeah, I knew a working girl with no legs, made
  twenty-five hundred a night just sitting there. Spinning.

Stuart Glazer: What about the zoo scene? Do we really need that?
Adam Rafkin: Peter, no! The zoo scene is the centerpiece of the
  movie. Everything depends on the zoo scene. The gunfight at the
  zoo, the slaughter of the pandas. That's the contrapuntal
  expression of man's inhumanity to man. That's what makes this an
  allegory, yes, to the destructive nature of the Ubermensch.
Peter Dragon: Ubermensch? Look, I like when the chick gets trampled
  by the zebra, it makes a great poster. The zoo scene stays.

Uncle Lonnie: You're threatening me? That's a laugh... I'm
  seventy-nine years old. I've got one kidney, one ball and one lung.
  I take Viagra just to keep from peeing on my shoes, and you're
  threatening me? Who are you frightening?

Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: Wendy, how many times do I have to tell you.
  never call me Rene when I'm trying to intimidate the white man!

Asher: It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice.

Peter Dragon: I'm gonna work you like Kunta Kinte! Are you following
  me?
Adam Rafkin: Uh... up to a point.

Peter Dragon: Let's make magic, baby!

Salma Hayek: Puerco, cerdo, marrano, cochino!
Peter Dragon: Wha... Hey, Iglesias, what did she just say?
Man: Pig.
Peter Dragon: What do you mean, pig? She spoke for ten minutes! It's
  a three-letter word!

Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: Name's Dick Marcellus.
Peter Dragon: Dick Marcellus... Like Ving Rhames in Pulp Fiction?
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: That's right. It's an *homage*.

Wendy Ward: Is that the gun I gave you for Hanukkah?

Peter Dragon: What's your favorite movie of all time?
Dick 'Rene' Marcellus: I would say that I was most affected by the
  elegant impressionism of François Truffaut's Day for Night.

Asher: [being threatened by Peter] Peter, it's nice to be important,
  but it's more important to be nice.

Peter Dragon: Hey Rafkin, check it out: it's Salma Hayek.
Adam Rafkin: Where?
Peter Dragon: There! She'd be perfect for the female lead in
  'Gunclub'.
Adam Rafkin: Oh, yes, perfectly perfect. She's - I thought about her
  all the time I was writing. I think about her a lot when I'm not
  writing [laughs awkwardly] .

Salma Hayek: [reminding Peter of the first time they met] You wanted
  me to take my shirt off.
Peter Dragon: Sometimes, Salma, a little nudity is... it's intrinsic
  to the story, you know, for the role.
Salma Hayek: I was auditioning for the part of the nun.
Peter Dragon: What, haha, nuns don't take showers now? Is that -
  [Salma slaps him across the face again]

Peter Dragon: Lloyd, you wanna do lunch tomorrow?
Lloyd 'Andre' Bellwether: Sure Peter, eh, let me check my... book.
  [Peter smirks and points because he just got Floyd to reveal his
  real identity, Lloyd realizes and starts pounding the floor in
  frustration, Peter bursts out laughing]
Peter Dragon: You Disney guys are dumb fucks!

Peter Dragon: Anybody'd be a fool not to hire you, Sean. [Wendy Ward
  enters] But I think I'm gonna hire this whore instead.


# "Action" (1999) {Strong Sexual Content (#1.9)}
Adam Rafkin: I wanna have sex with every person here.
Peter Dragon: Don't look at me!
Adam Rafkin: The ugliest man in this place is twice as pretty as the
  prettiest girl I ever slept with!

Peter Dragon: These girls want the same thing that you want.
Adam Rafkin: No, Peter, I don't believe any of these women want my
  mother dead.

Peter Dragon: You an actress, Jenny?
Jenny: [laughs] No, no, you know I wanted to be, but they found out
  my I.Q. was over 80.

Adam Rafkin: Why would Peter have a frog... in his ass?
Julia: These guys become so jaded they have to resort to some pretty
  weird stuff to get themselves stimulated.
Adam Rafkin: That's... ew... that's... grotesque, isn't it?
Julia: Well, my philosophy is: if it feels good, do it.

Adam Rafkin: Oh, you didn't, you didn't hear the thing about the
  frog?
Stuart Glazer: [rips off his sunglasses] No, and I don't want to live
  another minute without hearing it.
Adam Rafkin: Well, it seems as though our friend Peter was rushed
  into the emergency room with a frog in a little place called... his
  ass.
Stuart Glazer: [laughs] Oh, who says, that can't be true.
Adam Rafkin: They have the frog on the Internet in a jar of
  formaldehyde.

Peter Dragon: [having just had sex with his ex wife Jane] You're the
  only woman I ever met that could hum and whistle at the same time.

Peter Dragon: Jane, what the hell are you doing here? We reconciled.
Robert 'Bobby G.' Gianopolis: Reconciled? I screwed her two hours
  ago.
Peter Dragon: Well now she's returning the favor.


# "Action" (1999) {The Last Ride of the Elephant Princess (#1.13)}
Peter Dragon: Guy, there's nothing more pathetic than two white men
  trying to high-five. Put your hand down, there's people watching.

Peter Dragon: [about Guy] He's so gay that I'll bet money he's
  straight.

[last lines]
Peter Dragon: Take me to the office, Lonnie.
Uncle Lonnie: Petie, you've been up all night, you haven't slept. Why
  don't you go home?
Peter Dragon: That is home.

Wendy Ward: [reading a list of potential directors] Two left, this
  one's weird: Cher.
Peter Dragon: That is weird. You know what's weird about that? That
  she's not the last name on the list.

Peter Dragon: Teen comedies? I hate Teen comedies! You get those, you
  get those same eight idiots running around with that moron David
  Arquette, getting slashed or wearing bodices or screwing pastry. If
  I wanna see somebody have sex with a cupcake I'll buy a box of
  Twinkies and I'll drive down to Tijuana and I'll do it myself.

Guy: Peter Dragon, Peter Dragon, Peter Dragon [moves some flowers to
  grab Peter's hand] I am such a fan I feel like I've known you my
  whole life. I grew up on your movies. You made me want to become a
  filmmaker. Let's this...
Peter Dragon: Wow, that's fantastic. [raises voice] Guy, let go of my
  hand, Guy! First of all, you're older than me, so save me the AFI
  achievement speech, okay? And second of all, you burried me in
  bullshit before we could even say hello.
Guy: Hey, look at us, already cussing up a storm and having locker
  room fun!

Peter Dragon: I wanna see people running around like Michael Jackson
  at a Toy's R Us, let's go.

Peter Dragon: Is this another sexual harassment thing? When are women
  going to realize that 'no' is just another letter short of 'now'?

Bill Rothstein: There is one little old thing over at Dragonfire
  films that we've eh, had our eye on for some a while now. [glances
  at his brother, snorts] We want, eh, one of your executives to come
  work for us.
Peter Dragon: Eh, eh, I don't know. I don't think so. Stuart Glazer
  is eh, well he's my president of production, he's honest,
  trustworthy, loyal, works hard, he's, quite frankly, he's the
  backbone of the company. I can give him to tomorrow at 8. A.M., how
  is that?
Bill Rothstein: He's great, Stuarts great. We don't want Stuart. We
  want your other executive. We want Wendy Ward.

Wendy Ward: This is a job for The Elephant Princess.

Peter Dragon: [after a wild night with the Rothstein brothers]
  Where's your coat?
Wendy Ward: [laughs awkwardly] One of them ate it.

Peter Dragon: I don't know how to thank you for this, Wendy.
Wendy Ward: Here's how to thank me Peter: I want you to turn around,
  I want you to get into your limo and I want you to drive away. I
  want you to go back to your life and I want you to forget that you
  ever met me.
Peter Dragon: What are you talking about?
Wendy Ward: I'm through with this, Peter, I called a cab, and I'm
  gonna go home and pack and I'm gonna move some place, some place
  clean. But if the movie's a hit, I want you to call me, because I
  want all my money back.


# "Action" (1999) {Twelfth Step to Hell (#1.6)}
Peter Dragon: Jim. We're going to hell.
Jim Maxwell: I know.
Peter Dragon: At least I ain't walking.

Peter Dragon: You know why God invented the theater? So the *ugly*
  actor would have a place to work!

Peter Dragon: If we don't let druggies and drunks make movies,
  everybody'd be standing in line to watch three Amish people milk a
  goat.

Holden Van Dorn: Peter, my counselor says that I'm an addict, ok?
Peter Dragon: Yeah, in here you're an addict, ok, but on a Hollywood
  sound stage you're a tortured genius who takes frequent naps.

Jim Maxwell: You know, the sun is the real silent killer. And not
  just direct sun, also second-hand sun.

Peter Dragon: [discussing the product placement of cigarettes in a
  film] You want me to sell cancer... to children?
Jim Maxwell: Yes.
Peter Dragon: For *under* three million dollars?

Scott Wolf: Peter, I looked totally in proportion on Party of Five.
Peter Dragon: Yeah, how did they do that? What are you sitting on a
  phone book, or...
Scott Wolf: Well, special sets, camera angels, and Neve Campbell is
  only 3 foot 8.
Peter Dragon: Hm, I'd still do her.
Scott Wolf: I'm kidding.
Peter Dragon: I'm not.

Scott Wolf: Peter, I've seen more ass in the last two months than
  you've seen in your entire life.
Peter Dragon: 'Course you have, 'cause your eyes are at ass level.

Peter Dragon: Come on, I read the Bible.
Wendy Ward: You did not. When did you read the Bible?
Peter Dragon: I read the part about Jesus and the, the whore, Marlee
  Matlin, right?


# "Adam-12" (1968)
Jim Reed: You just have to know how to arrest them and still make
  them like you. We call it technique.

Pete Malloy: You know what this is?
Jim Reed: Yes sir, it's a police car.
Pete Malloy: This black and white patrol car has an overhead valve V8
  engine. It develops 325 horsepower at 4800 RPM's. It accelerates
  from 0 to 60 in seven seconds; it has a top speed of 120 miles an
  hour. It's equipped with a multi channeled DFE radio and an
  electronic siren capable of admitting three variables, wale, yelp,
  and alert. It also serves as an outside radio speaker and public
  address system. The automobile has two shotgun racks, one attached
  to the bottom portion of the front seat, one in the vehicle trunk.
  Attached to the middle of the dash, illuminated by a single bulb is
  a hot sheet desk. Fastened to which you will always make sure is
  the latest one off the teletype before you ever roll.
Jim Reed: Yes sir.
Pete Malloy: It's your life insurance and mine. You take care of it
  and it'll take care of you.
Jim Reed: Yes sir. You want me to drive?

Pete Malloy: A wise man once said; great hazards accompany
  innovation.
Jim Reed: Yeah. Who was that?
Pete Malloy: Me!


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Anatomy of a 415 (#5.22)}
Officer James A. Reed: Have you got someplace to spend the night Mr
  Spencer?
John Spencer: Yeah, I've got a sister that lives nearby.
Lois Spencer: Sure, go over to your sister's.
John Spencer: I'll be back in the morning to get my stuff.
Lois Spencer: Good, it will be in the trash!


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Credit Risk (#7.10)}
Officer James A. Reed: You know that they're talking about doing away
  with money all together, just using one big giant plastic credit
  card, feeding it into a giant computer.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Might work.
Officer James A. Reed: Not for me. Machines might be efficient, but
  they don't feel anything.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Elegy for a Pig (#3.8)}
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Telling a policeman's wife she's a widow is
  a job nobody wants. I never tried as hard for anything. He was a
  friend. It had to be me. [much softer] It had to be me.

Officer Peter J. Malloy: From now on, she'll have to open her own
  doors. Carry her own troubles. And her childrens'. Alone. From now
  on, it's just the three of them, instead of just the four. And if
  there must be a final postscript to all of this, then let it here
  be noted: the coffin will soon be buried. He will be forgotten
  except by a very few. Out of sight, out of mind. And strangely
  enough, in view of current custom, no one will raise a placard to
  denounce his senseless murder. No one will raise indignant cries of
  protest at the shedding of his blood. No one will march in anger
  because of his death.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Harry Nobody (#5.7)}
Ellen Craig: Sooner or later his story will fall apart, it always
  does.
Harry Craig: Tommy, you can believe your old gramps this once, can't
  you?
Tommy Craig: [to Reed] He doesn't mean to lie, he just doesn't know
  what the truth is anymore.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Keeping Tabs (#5.23)}
Officer Peter J. Malloy: It really wasn't that big of a caper. I know
  its embarrassing but the rest of the guys around here understand.
Sgt. MacDonald: You know Pete, I must have made that same speech to a
  dozen other cops whose sons were arrested, but I guess I won't be
  making it again. Somehow it isn't the same when it's your own boy.

Sgt. MacDonald: Whatever we did, he understood. It was natural.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: He's growing up, Mac.
Sgt. MacDonald: I know. I think that's where I've had the most
  trouble adjusting.

Sgt. MacDonald: I end up not wanting him to do anything, fearing he
  will make some kind of mistake.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: You know, when I was a kid I built one of
  those model ships. I worked on it every day after school. It was
  pretty detailed, exact rigging and built to scale. When I was done,
  I took it to a pond where we lived and I put it in the water. A
  gust of wind grabbed it and got it going too fast and sent it
  toward some rocks. So I ran around the pond and jerked it out of
  the water. I never sailed it again, I was afraid it was going to
  get damaged. I took it home and put it on a shelf in my bedroom. I
  never really enjoyed it again.
Sgt. MacDonald: This is a boy, not a model ship.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: I get the feeling that you're never going to
  be pleased with him until you let him succeed on his own terms,
  despite the risks, and he does.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 101: The Stolen Lawn (#1.9)}
Officer Peter J. Malloy: You did a big thing.
Officer James A. Reed: Yeah, but did I do the right thing?
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Probably, but on this job the only thing
  that's black and white is the car.

Pete Malloy: The only thing black and white about this job is the
  car.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 122: Christmas - The Yellow Dump Truck (#1.13)}
Officer Peter J. Malloy: I guess I sound pretty hard hearted.
Officer James A. Reed: No I understand, I guess they all need a lot
  of things.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: You can't let yourself get all bent out of
  shape everytime you see someone unhappy on this job. Get involved
  up to a point. You go beyond that you go screamin' up the wall.
Officer James A. Reed: Yeah, I guess you're right.

Officer James A. Reed: Pete, you know, sometimes you really confuse
  me.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: You don't believe everything I say, do you?
Officer James A. Reed: Pretty much, yeah.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Well you should, except when I'm talking
  through my hat!


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 153: Find Me a Needle (#2.2)}
Sgt. Miller: She could be anyplace. A bar, another party, or at the
  bottom of some gully up on Mulholland.
Officer James A. Reed: There's gotta be a thousand ravines up there.
Sgt. Miller: If she has been hid, it will be like looking for a
  needle in some haystack.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Maybe we can find this needle if we start
  with the guy that dropped it.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 155: Internal Affairs - Blackmail (#3.16)}
Waitress: One lousy dime, that's not a tip.
Officer James A. Reed: No ma'am, it's a hint.

Officer Pete Malloy: People calling us pigs - wives and children and
  friends having to live with that - because one rotten cop gets both
  his feet in the trough.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 52: Good Cop - Handle with Care (#2.3)}
Officer James A. Reed: It doesn't seem fair.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Sure its fair.
Officer James A. Reed: I don't agree. They're abusing a legitimate
  grievance procedure. We knock ourselves out to do a good job and
  now this.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Maybe we should stencil it on our uniforms:
  Good cops, handle with care.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 62: Grand Theft Horse? (#1.16)}
Officer James A. Reed: You think we're in trouble, for firing at the
  suspects back there?
Officer Peter J. Malloy: It's possible, it will be mostly up to the
  captain, after he gets the report.
Officer James A. Reed: We didn't have much choice, did we?
Officer Peter J. Malloy: We could have let them get away from us.
  Maybe another unit would have stopped them, and maybe not. Maybe
  they would have killed someone no matter how it went down. I didn't
  figure we had much choice.
Officer James A. Reed: You think the captain will see it that way?
Officer Peter J. Malloy: I don't know, in a spot like that sometimes
  you've got to take your chances with the book. It goes with the
  territory.

Officer Peter J. Malloy: That's life in the big city, and lessons
  aren't free.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 71: I Feel Like a Fool, Malloy (#1.7)}
Officer Peter J. Malloy: The world is full of squirrils and some days
  we get 'em all.

Officer James A. Reed: I don't think she's gonna make it Malloy.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: People die every day. ADW, hit/run, murder.
  Most of the time we're involved. But I'll tell you something, when
  it happens to a child you don't get used to it. Note: ADW:Assault
  w/deadly weapon.


# "Adam-12" (1968) {Log 72: El Presidente (#1.8)}
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Come on out Slade, you're surrounded. Put
  the gun down and come out now. Don't shoot Slade, we see you.
  [Gunshot rings out] Well that's not gonna work.

Officer James A. Reed: Malloy, things like this don't seem to get to
  you.
Officer Peter J. Malloy: Sure they get to me, but I was thinking
  about those kids. The way I figure it Slade had his chance, if he
  blew it that's tough. If he had killed one of those kids, it would
  have been a lot tougher.


# "Adderly" (1986) {Debbie Does Dishes (#2.14)}
[the boys have gagged and tied Mona to a chair]
V.H. Adderly: We're babysitting again?
Mona Ellerby: Maybe you're babysitting. I'm not babysitting. I've had
  it 100 per cent. I've just had it!
V.H. Adderly: I thought you liked the pitter-patter of little
  hobnailed boots.

Ice King: Do you know why I'm here? Do you know what Ice King means?
Jake: Yeah, I know what Ice King means: a big nerd!
Finn: Oh, holy cow!

Tree Trunks: Oh, no! A fly! Shoo! A fly landed on my pie, that's no
  good. Bye-bye. [Throws pie in trash]
Finn: Tree Trunks, why did you threw that pie away? [Flies gather
  around pie]
Tree Trunks: Flies wanted it, and they can have it.

Ice King: Why don't people like me? Is it because I'm a magic user?
  Or is my beard too shaggy? I try so hard to be a good husband to
  girls. What's wrong with me?
Cosmic Owl: Hoot! You're a sociopath.
Ice King: Who are you? Oh, I know! You're probably a - a big nerd!
  Why don't you try being cool like me?

Jake: I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my
  face.

Finn: Tree Trunks, I got jacked up because of you! Look at my
  jacked-up face!

Tree Trunks: Jake, I think Finn's getting jacked up again.

  after he tossed a snowball at it] Hey, no fair sneaking up on me
  like that!
Zach Nichols: [both laugh] I was just seeing if you were there! You
  better get movin'.
[bends down and forms a snowball but one hits him from above]
Zach Nichols: Hey - where'd *that* come from?
Annie Redfather: [laughing] My freezer. I've been savin' it since
  last year. Be right down!
Zach Nichols: [she runs from the window] And, Annie?
[she runs back]
Zach Nichols: Dress warmly; it's colder than it looks out here.
Annie Redfather: Hey, that's very considerate, Zach. Thanks.
Zach Nichols: [she runs off again] Wait, wait, Annie, just one more
  thing.
[she runs back and gets hit in the face with a snowball, he laughs]
Zach Nichols: Fresh snow beats freezer snow!

Annie Redfather: [comes over to the mound of snow they've built for a
  snowman's body holding a tiny snowball decorated with a carrot and
  rocks for a face] I don't think this is gonna cut it, Zach. [both
  laugh]

Sock: Hey - !

  Gotta mail earlier than *that*, Sock!

  the mound he dumped on him] So, do you surrender? Socrates!...
  Sock?
Sock: [towering behind him with a jumbo snowball raised] BOMBS AWAY!
Ari: [gulps] Uh-... oh...
Plato: [Sock slams the snowball down on him and laughs, he chuckles]
  Never a dull moment with those two around, eh, Zach? Annie?
Zach Nichols: [glumly] Yeah...
Annie Redfather: I guess.
Plato: All right, what is it? You two are about as cheerful as a pair
  of wet cats.
Ari: [emerges from the snowdrift] You mean cheerful as a wet
  prairie-dog! Brrrr!

Brother Pedro: Why do you turn away, my son?
Guillermo: I cannot beg from you, Brother Pedro; you - you're as poor

Brother Pedro: [smiles] No, no, I think perhaps I am even *poorer*
  than you.

Guillermo: Look! He carries a golden bell.
Brother Pedro: [chuckles] No - not gold. It is cheap brass.
Guillermo: But you clutch it so tightly. Surely it must be worth
  something.
Brother Pedro: It is not the bell that has value, but the song that
  it sings. I ring it to remind others to thank God for their
  blessings, and to share those gifts with others.

Brother Pedro: As you open your hands, open your heart.

  rise from causes him to be jolted from the ground atop of Ari's
  head] WHOA!
Ari: Ha! Like I don't understand bobcats. Sleep, sleep, sleep, all
  they do is sleep!
Sock: And digging holes all day is better? [Ari jerks back
  underground, causing Sock to lose his balance]

Sock: [comes up while both are laughing] Did somebody say scared? I

Ari: Talking brave and being brave - they're too different things.
Plato: Aristotle, you're as eloquent as your namesake, the great
  philosopher.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Determination (#2.6)}
Sock: [Gasps] I just had an awful thought. Think there'll ever be a
  time when Zach and Annie *won't* need to hear Plato's stories
  anymore?
Ari: Sssssh. Not so loud.

Annie Redfeather: What time is it?
Zach Nichols: Eleven o'clock. [amused] Why? You gotta be somewhere?

Annie Redfeather: What time is it now?
Zach Nichols: [good-naturedly] When we get out of this, I'm buying
  you a watch.

Zach Nichols: Sock! Ari!
Annie Redfeather: [sees it's actually a pair of chipmunks who flee]
  Oops. When we get out of this, I'll get a watch if you get glasses.
Zach Nichols: [they laugh] Gee, I guess when you get lost like this,
  the first thing you start doing is seein' things.
Annie Redfeather: [touching his shoulder] Aw, you just missed our
  buddies.

Plato: I want to watch them, until they're out of sight.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Diligence (#3.5)}
Plato: Diligence means doing things even when they don't turn out to
  be particularly enjoyable. Zach, you're not always going to like an
  assignment. But an artist takes pride in his work and does the best
  he can, no matter what the job is.
Annie Redfeather: [laughing] Even if it means trying to take a
  flattering picture of Sock?


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Faith (#2.1)}
Annie Redfeather: The last thing we did together was plant
  blueberries together, just like we've done every spring, and we saw
  this beautiful sunset. Ruth used to tell me no one could make a
  sunset, or a tree, or a flower. Only God could do that. She really
  had this - deep faith... What good did it do her? It didn't keep
  her from falling, or dying when her head hit that rock.

Ari: [sneezes before clambering out of the barrel with a scroll] You
  know, ah, you really oughta dust these once every century or so!


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Friendship (#1.7)}
Sock: [of Waukewa's eagle] I wish *I* had a friend like that.
Ari: [after he pulled him free from spinning with the globe after he
  stuck his arm in the stand] Hey - who'd you think got your tail out
  of the equator?

Plato: All those things we call virtues, they're a part of being a
  good friend.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Generosity (#2.3)}
Sock: [precariously balancing cans over his head in the shape of its
  letters] Hey, look, everybody. I spelled my name too.
Ari: Wow, that's great, Sock. There's just one thing wrong.
Sock: What's that?
Ari: That's impossible.
Sock: [letting go in surprise] It is? [they tumble to the ground
  around him]


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Gratitude (#4.5)}
Ari: "Hev, everyone"? Where's the excitement? Where's the enthusiasm?
Aurora: And where's the smile?

Aurora: Plato, it sounds like our friend here is suffering from
  The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener Syndrome.

Sock: Aw, c'mon, Plato, c'mon. Can't you just give us a little hint?
Plato: Here's a hint: sit back and enjoy the rest of the story.
Sock: [chuckles] Good hint, big guy.

Sock: I think that cat got a bad rap. Not all of chase mice, you
  know. [everyone laughs]


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Honesty (#1.2)}
Ari: I've got a joke. Why'd the bobcat cross the road? To bother
  somebody else for a change!

Plato: Zach...
Zach Nichols: Plato, I *learned* my lesson.
Plato: Which is?
Zach Nichols: Uh... Don't touch the cameras?
Plato: Zach, I think you're missing the *big* picture.
Sock: [laughing] "Big picture"? Camera joke, right?
[Plato glares at him]
Sock: [sighs] Guess not.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Honesty (#3.9)}
Annie Redfeather: He'd sell his soul for a bag of cookies.
Sock: I would not! But I'd definitely rent it out.

Aurora: It's just not fair.
Plato: That's what the badgers of Hamelin thought about the deal they
  made with the Pied Piper.
Ari: Oh, was that the fellow who picked a pack of pickled peppers?
Aurora: [laughs] No. That was *Peter* Piper.

Plato: The town of Hamelin had a serious rat problem. But the real
  rats in town weren't vermin. They were town officials wearing
  ermine.
Sock: Uh... what's ermine?
Plato: A special kind of fur. In the Old World, in the old days, it
  was used to trim fancy robes, like the mayor and councilmen wore.
Sock: You mean - these badger officials wore someone else's fur?
Plato: Oh, that's not all they did.
[Sock screams and waves his arms in horror]


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Integrity (#4.8)}
Aurora: Sounds like Zach's having some fun in the spotlight.
Plato: And if he's not careful, he's going to get burned by that
  light.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Leadership (#3.3)}
Plato: When a leader only hears his or her own voice, but is deaf to
  others, she is doomed to fail.
Zach Nichols: That's it; exactly, Plato! Who said that? Einstein?
  George Washington?
Plato: [chuckles] No. I just made it up.

Plato: His advisors were at a loss, until one of them got - well,
  let's just call it... [laughs] a hair-raising idea.

Plato: [laughs after Sock drags over the book with him still sleeping
  on it] OK, Ari, move along.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Loyalty (#1.8)}
Zach Nichols: Loyalty can be very powerful.
Plato: To tell you the truth, Plato, I don't even know what it means.
Zach Nichols: Well, it's when you're devoted to someone else. The way
  kids are devoted to their parents.
Ari: [strides over holding the book he just dug up to where Sock
  holds the binoculars watching him laughing] Oh, you're just a
  laugh-*riot* today!
Plato: [grinning] Or like when friends know they can rely on each
  other. [the two look at each other and grin good-naturedly]

Zach Nichols: Man. Loyalty is such a strong... emotion.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Moderation (#4.6)}
Annie Redfeather: That prairie dog's turning into a real pack-rat.

Sock: It's a miracle he gets in or out without starting an
  earthquake. [yelps in startlement as a crack shows up in the ground
  then Ari airs, dislodging several things with him] See what I mean?
Plato: Not at the moment. [Sock and Annie laugh at the handkerchief
  that landed on his face]

Annie Redfeather: You can have a garage-sale.
Ari: But I don't have a garage.

Plato: You can get too much of anything.
Zach Nichols: Even stories?
Plato: Yes, even stories. If I told you too many at once, you'd get
  sick of them. But if I tell them in moderation, they stories stay
  with you.

Plato: Well, there's one thing you can't overdo.
Zach Nichols: What's that?
Plato: Thanking parents for helping you learn things.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Patience (#3.1)}
Ari: Tryin' to teach you is like - like - like tryin' to teach the
  buffalo the backstroke!
[Plato clears his throat]
Ari: Oh... sorry, pal. I was just tryin' to make a point.
Plato: [chuckles] Point well taken.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Perseverance (#2.4)}
[first lines]
Zach Nichols: Wow. I can see why they *call* it Plato's Peak.
Annie Redfeather: Let me see. [takes the binoculars] Whoa. That's
  incredible.
Sock: [comes over] *What's* incredible?
Zach Nichols: Plato's Peak. It looks just like Plato.
Sock: Yeah, right. Next you'll be tellin' me there's a mountain in
  South Dakota that looks like four presidents!
Annie Redfeather: [hands over the binoculars] Here, Sock. See for
  yourself.
Sock: [holds them up and adjusts the dial; as he does Plato steps in
  front of him and after a moment he sees him] It's all blurry... Oh,
  wait a sec, here we go... Yeah, there it is. That's amazing. It
  looks just like...
Plato: Hi, Sock. What're you looking at?
Sock: AHH! [jumps back and lands in Zach's arms while Annie catches
  the binoculars]
Plato: Didn't mean to startle you.
Sock: That's OK, I... I just thought you were a talking mountain.

Sock: I got plans for tomorrow morning. Like sleeping in 'til
  tomorrow afternoon.

Zach Nichols: Well, learning the guitar is hard, you know? There's so
  many notes and strings and - and it hurts my fingers.
Plato: Weell, I don't have fingers, but I'm sure you're right.

Annie Redfeather: The trail's so much steeper up here.
Plato: It's often like that; the higher you climb, the tougher the
  trail.

Annie Redfeather: Admit it, you hid all this stuff for us to find,
  didn't you?
Plato: [grinning innocently] Would we do that?

Annie Redfeather: Say, you think maybe they'd let me back in
  karate-class?
Plato: Well, let's put it this way: I don't think they'd *kick* you
  out.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Respect (#1.9)}
Sock: [sees the title of a book about to fall he landed against when
  he hit the shelf] Hmm, Gravity. [falls]

Sock: Look who's callin' the canary yellow.
Plato: Sock, that's "pot calling the kettle black."

Plato: John's Please, well, was not pleased.

Plato: Being polite is the first step toward being respectful.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Responsibility (#1.3)}
Aurora: Well, looks like *those* two are having fun.
Ari: [shoots out from underground] Fun? Where? Where?

Annie Redfeather: My new bike!
Plato: It can be fixed in time, Annie. Just be thankful that Sock was
  in time to save *you*.
Annie Redfeather: But what about my mother's cakes?
Sock: [licking the icing of the one that fell on him] Give her my
  compliments. They're delicious.

Sock: [Ari shoots up from underground with the book, spraying him
  with sand] Ptooey! Talk about irresponsible!

Daedelus: [explaining the banging that was Icarus crashing into the
  wall to the guard] Just a nightmare. I dreamed I was flying and
  fell out of bed.

Icarus: Look! King Minos has discovered his caged birds have flown!

Plato: [after he reads The Chest of Broken Glass] Beautifully told,
  Ari.
Sock: [crying] Yeah. Not bad for a prairie-dog.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Responsibility (#4.4)}
Annie Redfeather: You know what I like about fishing?
Zach Nichols: What?
Annie Redfeather: Everything.

Annie Redfeather: [after she and Zach end up in the water trying to
  reel in a fish] I even like *this* part of fishing. [both laugh]


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Self-Discipline (#1.6)}
Annie Redfeather: Weird. He controlled armies, but he couldn't
  control his own temper.

Peter: [seeing her at his wedding] Mother. You look so... so...
Mother: The word is "old", my dear.
Peter: When did this happen?
Mother: I know. It seems like only yesterday that you were a boy.

Plato: [quoting Ben Franklin] Remember: "He that can have patience
  can have what he will."
Sock: Who said that? Some doctor?


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Self-Discipline (#4.3)}
Plato: What is it, Zach? You seem kind of, lost.
Zach Nichols: Hey, I can find my way around, Plato.
Plato: Not that kind of lost, Zach. Lost in confusion. As if
  something was troubling your mind.

Plato: You see, Zach, life isn't all fun and games. Though there once
  was a king and his people who thought so. That's your cue, Ari.

Ari: Good fortune smiled upon them, and maybe it would've kept
  smiling, if it weren't for all the celebrating.

Zach Nichols: [of Aurora] The wind has changed; I got it from a... a
  reliable source.

Zach Nichols: Hey, nothing like a little hard work and discipline to
  save the day.

: But how did you know it was gonna rain?
Zach Nichols: Uh... a little bird told me. [winks at Annie]


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Selflessness (#2.9)}
Sock: [chuckling] Aw, come on, Annie. Even I can be more selfless
  than that.
Ari: Oh, yeah? Then why don't you sit on that nest and give Aurora a
  break?
Sock: [backing away] Wait, let's not go off the deep end. [falls over
  the ledge]


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Trustworthiness (#2.5)}
Zach Nichols: [looks inside the paper bag Annie returned to him after
  he gave it to her to make sure Sock wouldn't get into it] Hey -
  where's my lunch?
Annie Redfeather: Well, I was *awfully* hungry, and it was only a
  *sandwich*, and I knew you wouldn't starve.
Zach Nichols: Oh, yaah? Tell it to my stomach! Besides, that's *not*
  the point! I *counted* on you!
Annie Redfeather: Yeah, I know. Which is why I didn't *eat* it.
  [takes out his bag with the sandwich in it from behind her back]
  Even though it's "no big deal"?
Zach Nichols: [taking and unwrapping it] OK, OK, I guess the small
  stuff *is* a big deal. Guess I gotta dust chairs after all...
  Unless, I can get someone *else* to do it. Yeah! I'll get someone
  else and tell Mrs. Mathers I'm freed up for something more
  important. Like that football demo. "Zach Nichols backs the throw -
  " [flings his sandwich fowarrd, Sock catches it in his mouth and
  falls over] Oops.


# "Adventures from the Book of Virtues" (1996) {Work (#1.1)}
Ari: [is pushed out from underground on a rise of water] Either it's
  raining or my waterbed sprang a leak.

Ari: Nice weather... if you happen to be a catfish!

Plato: Sock! Get down from there! Don't you know a tree's the worst
  place to be during an electrical storm?
Sock: Are you kiddin'? This is the safest tree in the forest! It's
  never been hit by lightning!
[the tree is struck and splits]
Aurora: Watch out!
Sock: [Ari dodges and he falls where he was standing] Of course,
  there's a first time for everything!

Ari: [tries to drag one of the logs by his teeth and quits in
  disgust] Man. How do beavers stand it?

Annie Redfeather: Sock is still struggling with the concept of
  *working for a common goal*.
Ari: Uh, she means he's a lazy bum.

The Dog: [the camel eats what he asked for back] What did you do that
  for? That stick belonged to the Man. Now I've got to pay for it.
  Sticks don't grow on trees, you know.


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {La Chute (#1.1)}
Father Bob Coburn: They were brave men, Billy, those first voyageurs.
  Just think of it: those men, Brulé, Radisson, Groseilliers, La
  Verendrye, Champlain himself. They were all here, perhaps standing
  in this very place. What a rich heritage for a young boy like you
  growing up here.
Billy Williams: Yes, sir.
Father Bob Coburn: This is the last frontier, Billy. Between those
  smokestacks and land our forefathers left. It's young men like
  yourself who are going to decide the future of this place.
Billy Williams: Weren't you scared, about the rapids?
Father Bob Coburn: Were you scared?
Billy Williams: Well, sort of. But it's exciting too.
Father Bob Coburn: It's a sense of challenge. I hope you never lose
  it. Well, we'd better be getting back. [turns toward campsite]
Billy Williams: Father?
Father Bob Coburn: [turns toward Billy] Yes?
Billy Williams: Are you still trying to decide about shooting the
  rapids?
Father Bob Coburn: No Billy, I'm not.


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {Lac Du Diable (#1.13)}
Hannah Wiliams: [incredulous] Lac du Diable!
Roger Lemieux: I want to make a photo story on it.
Billy Williams: And Pete and I can help Roger find it.
Hannah Wiliams: But all the stories about that place - people losing
  their minds and mysterious accidents.
Roger Lemieux: Well there must be a logical explanation about those
  stories.
Hannah Wiliams: And you're going to dive there?
Pete Gawa: Sure. If we can find the lake.
Roger Lemieux: We have to find Lavallée first. If somebody can lead
  us to Devil's Lake, it's Big Joe Lavallée.
Hannah Wiliams: Well, it all sounds pretty scary to me.
Billy Williams: Oh Hannah! Like Roger said, there has to be a simple
  explanation to those stories.
Pete Gawa: I think I know what it is. The devil really does live
  there!

Big Joe Lavallee: Roger, you tell Big Joe Lavallée why I find you in
  the swamp.
Roger Lemieux: The truth is Joe, we were looking for you.
Big Joe Lavallee: For me? Why are you looking for me?
Roger Lemieux: We need your help. We want you to take us someplace
  that you are the only one to know.
Big Joe Lavallee: Oh, that's true. I know every place around here for
  500 miles around. What's the place?
Roger Lemieux: Lac du Diable.
Big Joe Lavallee: Mon Dieu! You're joking!
Roger Lemieux: No, Joe. I'm very serious. I must find it.
Big Joe Lavallee: What for you want to go there, that evil place? You
  know what will happen to you?

Big Joe Lavallee: We'll go around this swamp and straight south to
  Lac du Diable.
Billy Williams: South, Joe?
Billy Williams: Sure, south.
Roger Lemieux: Why do you ask that, Billy?
Billy Williams: Nothing. Just wondering if Joe was sure it's south.
Big Joe Lavallee: When I say south, she's south.
Roger Lemieux: Oh easy, Joe. The boy was just asking.
Big Joe Lavallee: I don't like when people don't trust Big Joe!


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {Long, Tough Race (#1.7)}
John Onoman: You don't look like a doctor to me.
Dr. Janet Rhodes: Well I *am* a doctor. And I think I'm a pretty
  *good* doctor.

Dr. Janet Rhodes: John?
[John facing away, turns around]
Dr. Janet Rhodes: Wynona is very sick.
John Onoman: What's the matter?
Dr. Janet Rhodes: I'm not sure. She needs hospitalization, right
  away.
John Onoman: We'll see.
Dr. Janet Rhodes: [incredulous] I don't care if you see or not! I'm
  ordering her into the hospital.
John Onoman: I said we'll see.
Dr. Janet Rhodes: John, she needs medicine! Right now!
John Onoman: Write it down. I'll get it.

[last lines]
Billy Williams: Why did John change his mind about taking Wynona to
  the hospital?
Pete Gawa: She was really sick.
Billy Williams: Yeah, but he knew that before.
Pete Gawa: Maybe. John is the head of the family. He had to do it
  when he was ready, not when a girl doctor ordered him to.
Billy Williams: Well he sure picked the darndest time; right before
  the race.
Pete Gawa: The race didn't matter as much as his sister.
Billy Williams: Any reason for not telling me all this?
Pete Gawa: Nothing personal. John asked me to help him. Two of us
  were enough.
Billy Williams: He ran a good race. A long, tough one.
Pete Gawa: He's still running it, Billy.


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {Milk Run (#1.15)}
Dennis McGubgub: [piloting Cessna Skywagon] I'm going to have to put
  down and wait out this storm.
Russ Jordan: [holding gun on Dennis] You just keep flyin'.
Dennis McGubgub: Look! Kid! The Lacloche Mountains are down there to
  the right. I can't go over 'em. This stuff is solid up to 5,000
  feet. I'm going to have to set 'er down or slam into one of those
  peaks.
Russ Jordan: You think I'm pretty stupid, don't you? I know you guys;
  you fly in any kind of weather. You'll make it.
Dennis McGubgub: You've been watching too many movies. Why don't you
  sit down and fasten your seatbelt, uh?

Russ Jordan: [looking over beached seaplane] Huh! That's a bad bang
  on the float.
Billy Williams: Think it's serious?
Russ Jordan: [pensive] Have you got a knife?
Billy Williams: Yeah, a hunting knife. Why?
Russ Jordan: Alright, look. Go into the woods and scrape up all the
  pine pitch you can find. We're gonna fix this thing.
Billy Williams: Hey! How come you know so much?


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {Night Caller (#1.21)}
Roger Lemieux: So there was no accident?
Pete Gawa: No.
Roger Lemieux: Why didn't you check to see if it was true?
Pete Gawa: My uncle doesn't have a phone.
Roger Lemieux: You could have telephoned the chief or the police.
Pete Gawa: I didn't think of it. They said it was bad, and I had to
  get there right away.
Roger Lemieux: The oldest trick in the world, and you fell for it.

Roger Lemieux: I'm afraid the mural is ruined.
Nancy Williams: Good! I never liked it anyway. But don't tell Tommy
  that.
Billy Williams: But it cost us 400 buck, Mom!
Nancy Williams: *That* we'll tell them.

[last lines]
Hannah Wiliams: Mom, would you really have sold the lodge?
Nancy Williams: Well I might have. Just to get rid of the painting.


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {Panic in the Bush (#1.6)}
Billy Williams: Come on, Williams, keep a hold of yourself! Gotta
  find Pete!

Nancy Williams: Bush panic...
Dennis McGubgub: It's a strange phenomenon, Nancy. Seasoned trappers,
  men who have lived all their lives in the bush have gotten it. They
  can be lost, come out of the bush, cross a highway and then plunge
  right back into the bush on the other side.
Nancy Williams: But what causes it?
Dennis McGubgub: Nobody knows. It's just a kind of panic that attacks
  different people in different ways - jet pilots, racing car
  drivers, boxers - but one thing they all have in common: they're
  all professionals.
Nancy Williams: Oh, but Billy...
Dennis McGubgub: Well, Billy's a professional. He's an expert in the
  bush. If he comes - when he comes out, he'll probably never get
  bush panic again.

[last lines]
Billy Williams: Thing is, Pete, I can't remember much of anything.
  Once I found myself going in circles, it's just a blank.
Pete Gawa: Bush panic. I had it once.
Billy Williams: You never told me that.
Pete Gawa: How many people are you going to tell?


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {The Eye of the Needle (#1.9)}
Fred Vincent: [motioning toward Dougall's tugboat] There he comes.
  The most ornery skipper in the North Channel.
Duvall: And maybe the best.
Fred Vincent: Now don't you ever let him hear you say that.
Duvall: His license up for renewal?
Fred Vincent: Yeah, but I don't think I'll give it to him.
Duvall: Why?
Fred Vincent: Because he's just too hard to get along with, that's
  why.

Fred Vincent: Well, Dougall, that should be about your speed - moving
  boxes from place to place.
Dougall McGregor: Hear that, Billy? He's started already. Now listen,
  Vincent, we up here work for a living. It's you government guys
  that keep shuffling things around.
Fred Vincent: How's business? You're still robbing the people blind,
  eh?
Dougall McGregor: Oh, sure. I'm making so much money, me and this old
  boat, that soon I'm going to retire in the South Seas, on my own
  island.
Fred Vincent: Well, you've learned what direction south is, Dougall?
  That's good - very good.

Dougall McGregor: If you're my deck hand today, then shape up!
  There's lots to do.
Billy Williams: [feigning sincerity] Aye aye, sir!
Dougall McGregor: First stop, Little Current. I've gotta pick up some
  new parts for the engine.
Billy Williams: Why? Is something wrong?
Dougall McGregor: [pats the side of the cabin] She's an old girl,
  y'know. Can't take too much pressure.
Billy Williams: I guess you and this tug have been through a lot
  together.
Dougall McGregor: Heh! That's certain! I expect we'll be through a
  lot more before we're done.
Billy Williams: You've got lots of good time left, you and this tug.
Dougall McGregor: Well; thank ya, lad.
Billy Williams: I'd say at least another... five years. [laughs]
Dougall McGregor: Why you young bilge rat! [chases Billy around the
  deck] I'll... I'll take a belayin' pin to ya!

Pete Gawa: I know how to get to Ripple Rock.
Mulholland: Do I know you, boy!
Pete Gawa: Gawa, Pete Gawa.
Mulholland: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The Gawas know this country. Some of
  my best guides used to be Gawas. Didn't your father work for me?
Pete Gawa: You cheated him.
Mulholland: [Chuckles] Yeah... [chuckles] Get outta here!
Pete Gawa: Come on, Mr. Saunders. We'll find the cabin.


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {The Muskies Have Lost Their Teeth (#1.14)}
Billy Williams: I just can't help it, Mom. I don't like that Mr.
  Philip Stevenson Hurst.
Nancy Williams: So try a little harder. He's come a long way for his
  first muskie and you make sure that he gets a big one.
Billy Williams: Oh, I'll take him to the places. But I'm cheering for
  the fish.
Nancy Williams: Young man, you be on your best behaviour! [Philip
  Hurst on the dock coaching his son] Oh, and keep him away from
  bees.
Billy Williams: Bees?
Nancy Williams: Yeah, he's allergic to tehm. A few bee stings are
  worse than a rattler bite.
Billy Williams: Okay, Mom. I'll keep it in mind.

Philip Jr: [climbing out of the water] Well? How'd I do, Dad?
Philip Hurst: Twenty seconds slower than your average for the
  distance. What's your excuse this time?

Philip Hurst: Kids these days, they don't seem to care. They don't
  want to put out the effort. And if you want to be the best, you've
  got to work at it. I guess I shouldn't bother you with this.
Nancy Williams: Oh that's all right, Mr. Hurst. I'm a good listener.
Philip Hurst: Then perhaps you can tell me: what's wrong with wanting
  to be the best?


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {The Return of Eli Rocque (#1.11)}
[first lines]
Billy Williams: You saw Eli Rocque? Heading for Whitefish Falls?
Pete Gawa: Looked that way. Maybe we ought to tell your Mom.
Billy Williams: Aw, I don't know. I gotta figure this thing out.
Pete Gawa: Why? She has to know.
Billy Williams: Look, Pete. Eli Rocque disappeared with my father on
  that plane into the bush. That was almost two years ago. Now you
  tell me you just saw Eli. You know what that means? If he's still
  alive, well maybe my father is. Pete, are you sure it was him?
Pete Gawa: I'm sure, Billy. If it wasn't Eli, it has to be his ghost.

Medicine Woman: [doing an incantation before an entranced Eli] You
  come here for Eli?
Pete Gawa: We wanna talk to him. We thought he was dead.
Medicine Woman: Eli *is* dead. Go on, talk to him... [cackles]

Dennis McGubgub: I'm still trying to figure out how Eli got back
  here.
Billy Williams: Well could the medicine woman have brought him back,
  Dennis?
Dennis McGubgub: Could be. Stranger things than that have happened in
  this area.

Pete Gawa: I think Eli Rocque spent the last two years trying to come

Billy Williams: That's weird, Pete. How come?
Pete Gawa: He came back to die among his own people. He should have
  died two years ago in the bush.

Hannah Wiliams: It was so strange being up there in that tower. And
  that view is so magnificent that you've just got to see it to
  believe it.
Nancy Williams: I imagine it is.
Hannah Wiliams: And then when I went to come down, I just froze.
Nancy Williams: But that could happen to anyone.
Hannah Wiliams: Yeah, I guess so. And when I saw the boys doing it,
  it just looked so easy I thought I could do it too. But the funny
  thing is, I think that if I was up there again I could come down
  without any trouble. Does that make any sense to you?
Nancy Williams: Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. You had your moment of
  fear and you beat it.
Hannah Wiliams: With Pete's help.


# "Adventures in Rainbow Country" (1969) {Town That Died (#1.8)}
Billy Williams: It's a pretty spot.
Roger Lemieux: That's why I can't understand. No need for the town to
  die because of the mine shutdown. All this could be developed.
Billy Williams: They could start a big tourist industry. Why not?
Roger Lemieux: Yes... Why not?

Roger Lemieux: Where is he?
Constable: In jail.
Roger Lemieux: What charge?
Constable: Oooh um... trespass... breaking and entering... um...
  theft... resisting arrest... [points to black eye] assault - how
  about that?
Roger Lemieux: Can I talk to him?
Constable: Oh I guess so. But don't kid yourself - I'm gonna make
  this stick.

Joe Bourke: [upon learining of Billy's arrest] Stupid! All of ya!
  Plain stupid!
Constable: Hey Joe, take it easy.
Joe Bourke: All you had to do was play ball with them. They'd have
  made their movie and gone without any trouble.
Constable: But Joe, that kid was snoopin' around the mine. I fixed
  it.
Joe Bourke: Lemieux's so steamed up he's about to make a noise that's
  gonna be heard from here to Moosonee. That's what you fixed.

Colonel St-Denis: Excellent coffee, Mrs. Williams.
Nancy Williams: [peeved intonation] Thank you, Colonel, most of my
  guests seem to enjoy it.
Colonel St-Denis: I'm pleased you can think of me as a guest, under
  the circumstances.
Nancy Williams: [still peeved] Once you have cleared up this
  situation, Colonel, uh - I might consider you a guest - I might
  even make you a meal.
Colonel St-Denis: I shall look forward to that.

Colonel St-Denis: It's the flight recorder from the experimental
  plane. What we learn from it could be vital to our nation's
  security. And to the peace of the world.
Nancy Williams: Colonel! I think I might make you that meal now.
Colonel St-Denis: [chuckles]
Billy Williams: We almost lost it again.
Colonel St-Denis: Well, you found it before it was irretrievably lost
  or fell into the wrong hands.
Pete Gawa: It's lucky I found it.
Colonel St-Denis: Why is that, Pete?
Pete Gawa: My people have a peace treaty with you.


# "Adventures in Wonderland" (1991)
Red Queen: Maybe the Duchess is better than I am after all.
White Rabit: Your majesty, don't say that! A lot of people are better
  than you but certinly not the duchess.

Red Queen: Now you know what it's like to be treated unfairly. The
  way you treated the Walrus!
Alice: You really should just talk to him. He's very nice.
Red Queen: I'll say, and he spoke up for all of you, even though you
  wanted to exclude him.
Tweedle Dum: Well... I guess we were being really unfair.
White Rabit: Uh... Can you ever forgive us, Mr. Walrus?
Walrus: Well, of course. Of course! No hard feelings! And I don't
  think you've ever heard this about walrus', but we never hold a
  grudge!
March Hare: That's okay, now that we're friends we'll hold it for
  you.

Mad Hatter: Really Hare! Do you have to make so much noise while I'm
  reading? You know I like it quiet enough to hear a feather fall.
March Hare: I do now. What is that your reading, anyway?
Mad Hatter: The Search For The Mummy's Treasure.
March Hare: When it comes to MY mummy, I'm her one and only treasure!
Mad Hatter: Not that kind of mummy! Not mother! The kind of mummy I'm
  reading about is all wrappped up in cloth and walks like this.
  [imitates a mummy's walk and frightens the Hare]
March Hare: He probably walks like that because his pants are wrapped
  too tight!
Mad Hatter: No. He walks like that to scare archeologists away from
  the treasure.

Red Queen: You know, sometimes old things are better than new ones,
  flaws and all.
Mad Hatter: Exactly. Why, we'd rather have our old Queen than a young
  one any day!

Mad Hatter: [re-enacting the scene of the crime] And then I
  slipped... and fell against the pedestal. [his hat falls off
  revealing the missing crown. Everyone gasps]
Mad Hatter: It's alright. I'm fine!
Red Queen: Hatter! My crown!
Mad Hatter: Yes, I know you want your crown! But don't worry, Your
  Majesty, with me on the case the crown-snatcher won't be able to
  keep this dastardly deed under his hat forever!
Red Queen: I mean, just give me my crown! [takes it from his head. He
  gasps at the realization]
Mad Hatter: It was under my hat the whole time?
March Hare: Boy, I sure hope this doesn't get into the private eye
  newsletter!
Mad Hatter: Your Majesty, I had no idea the crown fell on my head.
  You believe me, don't you?
Red Queen: What's not to believe?
Alice: Right. It's not that you and the Hare are bad detectives. You
  were just looking for crowns in all the wrong places.

March Hare: How could I have been so conceited!
Alice: Don't feel bad. You just got carried away.
Mad Hatter: You are still the smartest hare in my book.
March Hare: Really?
Mad Hatter: Sure. [opens up his own dictionary] See, under S for
  smart, that's your picture.
March Hare: Well, it sure wasn't very smart of me to think I didn't
  need my books.
Red Queen: That's the smartest thing you've said lately, Hare. So
  smart in fact, I have a question for you.
March Hare: Sorry, I'm out of the question answering business.
Red Queen: I don't care. My question is, do you want your
  Smarty-Pants Medal back?
March Hare: No way! I don't deserve it! I'm just a know nothing!
White Rabit: No, you're not a know nothing. You're just a not know
  everything.
Red Queen: Listen to the Rabbit. He knows these things.
March Hare: Okay, so if I'm not a know-nothing I'm at least a know
  very little.
Mad Hatter: No way are you a know very little!
Alice: You're at least a know a lot!
White Rabit: Yes, and a know a lot still deserves a Smarty-Pants
  Medal.

Red Queen: [on learning how different Christmas in Wonderland is]
  Well, this is terrible! Poor Alice doesn't have any Christmas
  traditions!
Alice: Oh, but I do! Like, decorating the Christmas tree in the
  living room.
March Hare: You have a tree in your living room?
Mad Hatter: Well, I have enough trouble with the vacuming, I sure
  wouldn't want to rake the carpet!

Mad Hatter: [on finding out the Hatter has won a castle in another
  land] Hare, you almost don't sound happy for me.
March Hare: Oh no, I'm happy as a clown!
Mad Hatter: Clowns are happy!
March Hare: When they're around their best friends they are.

Alice: [On learning about the Hatter's leaving Wonderland] Mr. Hare,
  are you sure you're not the saddest one of all?
March Hare: Oh no, I'm happy as a clown!
Tweedle Dee: Clowns are happy!
March Hare: Not unless one of their best friends moves to another
  side of the world, leaving them cooped up in their shell, wondering
  when they'll ever see them again.

Red Queen: What kind of tree is it?
March Hare: It's a weeping willow.
Red Queen: A weeping willow! I don't want to wake up in the morning
  and hear a willow weeping outside in my garden, that's depressing!
White Rabit: No, Your Majesty, the tree's branches droop so that it
  appears to be weeping. The tree doesn't really cry.
Mad Hatter: This one does! And not only does it water itself, it also
  waters all your other plants!

March Hare: [looking for a spare key] It's got to be in here
  somewhere! I don't know where to start! Why did I keep all this
  junk? I should have dumped this stuff long ago, but I did not have
  the heart!

[has just broken free of Robotnik's mind control]
MacHopper: I'm free!
Dr. Robotnik: Of course you're free, I never pay any of my minions.

Tails: We'll watch your kids. Sonic just loves hanging out with the
  babes.
Sonic: That's babes as in girls, not crying, drooling, hair pulling
  kids. I don't know the first thing about babies.
Tails: What's there to know? I mean you used to be one right?

Dr. Robotnik: I hate that hedgehog!

Dr. Robotnik: Duh, I think I hate that hedgehog, but I'm not sure.

Sonic: You don't wanna show off.
Tails: But you show off.
Sonic: Um, only while I'm doin' good.

Dr. Robotnik: I'm going to give you a tip.
Grounder, Scratch: Oh goody! [They hold out their hands]
Dr. Robotnik: The tip is, always buy new shoes in the middle of the
  day after your feet have expanded.
Scratch: Um, I'll try to remember that.
Grounder: Me too, if I ever get feet.

Old man: Can you help us?
Sonic: Do blue hedgehogs wear red sneakers?

Sonic: Here are three ways for you to be very smart: 1. Stay in
  school; 2. Stay in school; 3. Follow rules 1 and 2.

Sonic: [dressed as a cop] Let me speak to the driver.
Grounder: I'm not driving. He is!
Scratch: No I'm not.
Sonic: Driving without a driver? Now you're really in for it.

Scratch: We'll get it back, we promise.
Dr. Robotnik: Don't give me that. You were programmed to break
  promises!

Scratch: We possess it.
Grounder: Better than that, we got it right here.

Sonic: Gotta speed, Keed!

Sonic: Okay Vern, it's time to burn!

Sonic: Gotta blow, Joe!

Sonic: Gotta stryde, Clyde!

Dr. Robotnik: Coconuts! I was bamboozled by Sonic and it's all your
  fault.
Coconuts: What are you talking about? I wasn't even there.
Dr. Robotnik: Shut up! I'm in charge, I can blame whoever I want!

Sonic: You got it ace, let's race!

Grounder: I put my head back on for this?
Scratch: Oh shut up! At least yours is SUPPOSED to be detachable!

Grounder: I think I'm going to be sick to my stomach.
Scratch: We don't have stomachs!
Grounder: Okay, then I think I'm going to be sick to my transmission.

[throws a couple chili dogs]
Sonic: Catch some heartburn on us!

[repeated line]
Sonic: I'm waiting!

[repeated line]
Sonic: Up... over... and gone!

Sonic: We're up, over and... and what was *that*?

Scratch: Grounder, you're as dumb as a rock!
Grounder: Metamorphic, igneous or sedimentary?
Scratch: Dimwitaraenteous!

Sonic: Bite my dust, buster.

Dr. Robotnik: I'm waaaiting! Hmmm, now where have I heard that line
  before?

Grounder: Gee, it's small for an ultimate weapon.
Scratch: That's not the weapon, Dim-Dim! That's just the remote
  control!
Grounder: I knew that.

[the robots are dressing up as a gorilla]
Scratch: How come I have to be on the bottom?
Grounder: Cause your scrawny legs fit the costume.
Coconuts: And I'm the brains of this operation. Brains to body -
  forward march.
[they all fall]
Scratch: Grounder, I think I'm sitting on our brains.

Dr. Robotnik: Do you two realize what an evil genius I am?
Scratch: You are evil-geniusly to make me, your maliciousness.
Grounder: And eviler and geniuser to realize you could do better and
  make me.

Sonic: Right now, the only thing bigger than Tails' appetite is his
  stomach.

Sonic: You know? I sure have fun.

Dr. Robotnik: I've really outdone myself this time. Remind me to give
  myself the medal for excellence in supreme rotten-ness.
Scratch: Didn't you just give yourself that award last week?
Dr. Robotnik: Well, think up a better one then!

Tails: [disguised as a police officer] Driving a vehicle over the
  speed limit inside a building? That's gonna cost you too!
Grounder: Oh no! How much for that?
Tails: Five, maybe ten years.
[Scratch picks up Tails]
Grounder: Scratch! He's an officer!
Scratch: Ever see an officer with two tails?
Grounder: The fox brat! I knew that.
Scratch: You did not! Without me, you don't know anything!

Sonic: Way to go, little bro!

Tails: Look, Sonic! We're catching up!
Sonic: That's the key to speed, keed!

Sonic: Oh no, we've been suckered by a super-sucking vacuum trap!

Sonic: You don't really think this is going to slow me down, do you?
Grounder: Yeah, I do!
Sonic: [imitates buzzer] Wrong answer!

Tails: Wow. What's Robotnik gonna do with all these bombs?
Sonic: Nothing, because we're gonna make sure he doesn't get 'em by
  bringing this train to a screeching halt!

Grounder: [as his phone rings] Psst. Scratch! It's the Robotnik
  Hotline!
Bear: What'd you say? What was that?
Grounder: My tummy rumbling?
Bear: That's the strangest tummy rumbling I ever heard!
Scratch: Not really. It always sounds like that when Tails eats onion
  rings.

Tails: Nyah, nyah! You can't catch me!
Grounder: And why not?
Tails: You're slow, you're ugly, you're stupid...
Scratch: Yeah, right! Let's get him anyway!
[Scratch and Grounder miss Tails and hit a wall]
Tails: But you run into walls real good!

Sonic: Eat our dust, Coconuts!
Tails: I'm so hungry I could eat our dust!

Dr. Robotnik: I'll need something very tiny.
Scratch: How about Grounder's brain?
Grounder: Very funny.

Sonic: I'll make you famous like I did with Arnold
  Schwartzenegermaggerbah.

Sonic: It's everything you've ever dreamed of in a luxury car...
  except of course for this steering wheel.

Tails: [about to take out a time bomb with a mallet] I'll take care
  of this!
Sonic: No! The shock will set it off!
[Tails whacks down the mallet, but then realized he hit Sonic's foot]
Tails: [on the verge of tears] I'm sorry.
Sonic: I'm just glad you missed... the bomb, that is.

Sonic: You did good, pal. You sure packed away a lot of junk food
  there.
Tails: Yeah, I know.
Professor: Thanks for saving me, Tails
Tails: Hey, no problem. All in a night's work. [Tails' stomach
  rumbles, and he belches] I guess I need something to settle my
  stomach.

Sonic: [during a fight with Robotnik] Get outta here, Tails!
Tails: I wanna stay and help!
Sonic: You get out of here right now, or I'll tell everyone your real
  name is Miles.
Tails: No! No that! [Tails exits quickly]

  the beginning: How did you fall from the clear blue sky?
Ogre: Little boy threw us here.
Duke Igthorn: *Threw* you here...?
Ogre: From catapult camp.
Duke Igthorn: How do you think a little boy got so strong?
Ogre: He got small bottle of magic drink from Gummi Bear.
Duke Igthorn: [shouts] A Gummi bear? What kind of fool do you take me
  for?

Toadie: Okie dokie, Dukie!

Zummi Gummi: Actually, decorating has always been a tradition of
  Fall's Farewell, but lately, we've gotten very lazy about it.
Tummi Gummi: But getting lazy is what holidays are for.

Gruffi Gummi: Zummi, you've created a monster.
Zummi Gummi: I'm sorry I ever gave her that book.
Grammi Gummi: Well, I'm not. I think it's wonderful that she's
  sharing our tradition with her friend. Besides, I'm going to cook
  something really special.
Gruffi Gummi: Terrific. If I don't work myself to death, I can look
  forward to getting poisoned.

Zummi Gummi, Grammi Gummi: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but
  bugs are just to stomp on!

Grammi Gummi: He didn't touch my asparagus pie. He's just not acting
  like himself.

  make mince meat of 'em!

Cavin: Could I have something to drink?
Gruffi Gummi: No!
Grammi Gummi: Gruffi Gummi, YOU have the manners of a billy goat!

Tummi Gummi: I'll take care of the guard.
Grammi Gummi: How do ya plan to do that?
Tummi Gummi: Well, if he's hungry, I could bribe him with a turkey
  leg. You happen to have one on ya?

Zummi Gummi: As you all know, the Great Book of Gummi will never be
  finished.

Tummi Gummi: Gruffi takes his bossiness very seriously.

Cavin: All those stories about the Great Gummies... they really are
  just fairy tales. You're nothing but a bunch of... silly, selfish
  old bears! I'm just one boy, but I'm not afraid to try!

Grammi Gummi: You've just gotta believe in yourself.
Cubbi Gummi: It's hard when no one else believes in you.

Tummi Gummi: Yuck! These ropes taste nasty!
Cubbi Gummi: Just pretend they're Grammi's noodles.
Tummi Gummi: They're not the same without the sauce.

Gruffi Gummi: Early to bed and early to rise, and you won't have two
  glary eyes.

Tummi Gummi: This looks bad, doesn't it?
Grammi Gummi: Tummi, if you'd use your head instead of your stomach,
  you'd get in a lot less trouble.
Tummi Gummi: Then again, facing your troubles head on can be tasty.

Duke Igthorn: What's happening?
Grammi Gummi: What *always* happens when you leave out the purple
  berries.

Duke Igthorn: So, you think you're so clever.
Grammi Gummi: Did you really think I'd give you the recipe, Duke
  Ironbritches?
Duke Igthorn: Oh, but you will. We have ways of making Gummi Bears
  talk.

Gruffi Gummi: Well, I'll be bounced!

  you do that?' Well, I'm gettin' plenty tired of doin' this and
  that, so there!

Grammi Gummi: Nogum, you rascal! I haven't see you since I was
  knee-high to a water sprite! Where've you been all these years?
Nogum: Oh, just doin' a wee bit of this and a wee bit of that. [leans
  toward Grammi] And I thought I'd drop in and see how me favorite
  Gummi gal was doing.
Grammi Gummi: [laughs as she shoves him away] Oh, stop that!

Nogum: Why, Gruffi, last time I saw you, you were just a wee babe, a
  bounster mini!
Gruffi Gummi: Hmph! I was never a babe.
Nogum: To me, you still are!

Gruffi Gummi: That Nogum's an irresponsible nuisance. I wish you'd
  thrown him out, Grammi!
Grammi Gummi: [protesting] Throw him out? But Gruffi, Nogum is my
  friend. [smiling to herself] Besides, I haven't had this much fun
  in years.
Gruffi Gummi: Fun is one thing, but making a fool of yourself is
  another. Either he goes, or else! [everyone else agrees]
Grammi Gummi: Doh, have it your way!

Gruffi Gummi: [looking at the mess Grammi and Nogum made in the
  library] Look at this place! It's a mess!

  on destroying the catapult all by yourself!
Cavin: Oh, no. I had help. I had - [gasps, almost forgetting his
  promise to Zummi]
Zummi Gummi: Remember your promise!
Cavin: Truthfully, I had nothing to do with it. I was a prisoner, and
  when I saw the catapult rolling away, I jumped aboard to escape.
Zummi Gummi: Good boy!
King Igthorn: No matter, son. We're all safe now.

Cavin: Could I have something to drink?

  sprite! Wait! Wait, you sprite, wait a minute!
Cubbi Gummi: [joining her] A what?
Grammi Gummi: A slumber sprite. It put a sleeping spell on Gruffi!
  That's how they defend themselves. We'd better get it to wake him

  touch my asparagus pie. He's just not acting like himself.

  lies on the floor, whimpering in distress] Of course, it - wouldn't
  hurt to give him a little snack before he goes. [seeing a basket of
  broccoli muffins on the table, she takes it to Loopy] Here, we have
  all these broccoli muffins left from dinner.
Cubbi Gummi: [cringing] Ylah.

  He's got good taste.
Cubbi Gummi: I guess you and Gruffi are right. He says I'm not old

Alex Venables: Nothing... except it's old, the radio's broken and it
  smells of cheese.
Jimmy Venables: That is the smell of honest men's toil... and cheese.
Alex Venables: There you go, you see, mice stole your van.

Alex Venables: Actually, I agree with Dad on this one. I mean, I lost
  my house keys weeks ago and no one's any the worse. I just shin up
  the drainpipe and in through the window.
Jimmy Venables: [annoyed] You lost your keys weeks ago and you didn't
  tell anyone?
Alex Venables: I think the fewer people know about a missing key the
  better.

# "Afterdrive" (1990)
[theme song]
Denis Leary, Billy Kimball: Somewhere there's a place you can just
  get away / From the boss and the spouse and the cares of the day /
  A place you can go to forget about life for a while / But this
  ain't that place / This is just a TV show / A lousy alternative to
  reading a book / If you have problems, please seek professional
  care / Because this is Afterdrive / With Dennis Leary and Billy
  Kimball / And after Afterdrive / You'll just have to deal / You'll
  just have to deal / You'll just have to deal... / With the rest of
  your life!

Alison Mundy: Yes I am.

Alison Mundy: If you're sad, Daddy, is it because you don't love me

Robert Bridge: Don't be ordinary.

Alison Mundy: You look shit by the way.

Robert Bridge: I'm entitled to ignore you, why shouldn't I?
Alison Mundy: Because I'm going out of my mind!
Robert Bridge: WELL HALLELUJAH, A BREAK THROUGH!

Alison Mundy: What are you doing here? In my Home, in my life! WHAT
  DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

Alison Mundy: She got put in-in-in-in an Institution and she never
  came out. She died when she was 35. I was 10.
Robert Bridge: How old where you when you first saw spirits?
Alison Mundy: 10!

Alison Mundy: Who was that?
Robert Bridge: Jude.
Alison Mundy: Your ex-wife?
Robert Bridge: Yes.

Robert Bridge: It's not important.
Alison Mundy: Really?

  could? I'd run away if I could. I'd cut them out with a rusty
  knife, if I could, but I don't have any choice. You don't choose
  the spirits, they choose you.

Robert Bridge: [voiceover] It's death always that punches out the God
  shaped hole in our modern lives. If God is the father then he's not
  only abandoned his child he refuses to pay maintenance. And, like a
  lot of errant fathers he's difficult to track down in times of

  If that's what drink can do to a young woman, then our Prohibition
  laws are correct.

Tommy Beresford: [Referring to Tuppence] "Eileen O'Hara! Too
  impossibly Irish for words!" is how she put it.
Cicely March: She seems to have more perception than you, Mr. Blunt
Tommy Beresford: Well, in matters concerning women she just cannot be

Inspector Marriott: Do you happen to have a magnifying glass?
Tommy Beresford: Do we have a magnifying glass? [In feigned
  effrontery] What sort of detective agency do you think this is?

Tuppence Beresford: I think it's fun mixing business and pleasure.

Hank Ryder: [Drunkedly laughing] Beresford... you know what? You've

James Reilly: Well, uh, did you see that creature who was trailing us

# "Agatha Christie's Poirot" (1989) {After the Funeral (#10.3)}
Hercule Poirot: I am awaiting a concrete piece of evidence - the
  final piece of the puzzle.
Inspector Morton: What kind of evidence?
Hercule Poirot: I cannot say at the moment - I may be wrong.
Inspector Morton: Doesn't often happen to you.
Hercule Poirot: It has happened twice in my career.
Inspector Morton: That's a relief! To be right all the time might get
  a bit monotonous.
Hercule Poirot: I do not find it so.

Miss Gilchrist: Young people nowadays seem so uncaring. They don't
  know what it is to be alone in the world.
Hercule Poirot: The journey of life... it can be hard for those of us
  who travel alone, Mademoiselle. Have you always been a companion to
  a lady?
Miss Gilchrist: No. I used to have my own tea shop, "The Willow
  Tree". Oh, it was a delightful little place, Mr Poirot. All the
  china was blue-willow patterned... so pretty, and the cakes were
  really awfully good, if I say it myself. But a Lions establishment
  opened up nearby and my little place failed.
Hercule Poirot: Ah. Oh, this happens to many people in these times, I
  think.
Miss Gilchrist: [Service bell rings] It's Mr Timmons' bell...

Hercule Poirot: The journey of life can be hard for those of us who
  travel alone.

Hercule Poirot: They lied very well. They are all performers.

Hercule Poirot: You put a piece of wedding cake under your pillow,
  and you dream of your future husband.

George Abernethie: Yes, it's extraordinary, isn't it? The way some
  women are loyal to buffoons of husbands when other men, men who
  should inspire real loyalty, are made fools of.


# "Agatha Christie's Poirot" (1989) {Appointment with Death (#11.4)}
[talking about Poirot]
Lord Boynton: Oh God! Here comes that *ghastly* little Belgian!

Dr Gerard: [to Poirot] Where Lady Boynton is, the music of the
  spheres is curiosly like the nails down a blackboard.

Hercule Poirot: You see, mon ami, the voices of the little gray cells
  have begun to sing to Poirot.

Hercule Poirot: Did Lady Boynton harm you physically?
Raymond: My mother had little recourse to violence. She ws too smart
  for that. Instead, she just pried open the top of our skull and
  raked her poisonous tongue through our brains. No place to hide,
  Poirot - even in our heads!

Dame Celia Westholme: [Speaking of Sister Agniesska to Poirot] I
  don't much care for her... the way she hangs aroud the younger
  Boynton girl. They sniff out weakness... nuns... and misery, and
  they gorge on it. Bloody vampires in drag, quite frankly!

Dr Gerard: Look to the living. They pay their bills quicker and make
  better... conversation.

Hercule Poirot: There is nothing in the world so damaged that it
  cannot be repaired by the hand of the almighty God. I encourage you
  to know this, because without this certainty, we should all of us
  be mad.


# "Agatha Christie's Poirot" (1989) {Cards on the Table (#10.2)}
Hercule Poirot: The question is, can Hercule Poirot possibly by
  wrong?
Mrs. Lorrimer: No one can always be right.
Hercule Poirot: But I am! Always I am right. It is so invariable it
  startles me. And now it looks very much as though I may be wrong,
  and that upsets me. But I should not be upset, because I am right.
  I must be right because I am never wrong.

[Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver are in a gallery when Poirot
  frowns at an abstract sculpture]
Ariadne Oliver: You really must try and broaden your horizons a
  little. Some of these pieces are terribly revealing. For instance,
  what do you make of that?
Hercule Poirot: [sighs] I - I do not know what to make of it, Madame
  Oliver.
Ariadne Oliver: Not symmetrical enough for you?

Ariadne Oliver: Oh, look, it's Mr. Shaitana. What is he? An Armenian?
  A Greek?
Hercule Poirot: No one knows. All that is known is that he is one of
  the richest men in London.
Ariadne Oliver: He gives me the jitters.

Hercule Poirot: [referring to the gallery] But I see that you
  yourself have lent a few pieces?
Mr. Shaitana: Oh, one picks up trifles, here and there. I have a few
  interesting objects I could show you. I daresay I could even
  produce one or two things in your line, Poirot.
Hercule Poirot: Ah, so you have then, your private 'black museum,'
  no?
Mr. Shaitana: Oh, no, no, no. I don't collect the artifacts of crime:
  the murderer's hammer, the poisoner's cup. I collect only the
  finest objects of their kind.
Hercule Poirot: And what do you consider to be the finest objects,
  artistically speaking, in crime?
Mr. Shaitana: Why, the human beings who commit them, Monsieur.

Mr. Shaitana: [gesturing grandly to his mansion] It is modeled on the
  Alhambra!
Ariadne Oliver: In Pontefract?
Mr. Shaitana: [bemused] In Spain.
Ariadne Oliver: Oh, I thought you meant the picture house. Sorry.

[Hercule Poirot attends a party at Mr. Shaitana's home]
Mr. Shaitana: My dear Monsieur Poirot, come in, come in. How simply
  divine to see you.
Hercule Poirot: Monsieur Shaitana.
Mr. Shaitana: I don't know if you know the famous Mrs. Oliver.
Hercule Poirot: Ah, yes, of course I do. Enchante, Madame.
Ariadne Oliver: Hello, Poirot.
Hercule Poirot: I did not realize you accepted this kind of
  invitation, Madame.
Ariadne Oliver: Oh, well, Mr. Shaitana can be awfully persuasive.
Mr. Shaitana: We met at a literary dinner. Mrs. Oliver was the guest
  of honor.
Ariadne Oliver: Oh, yes, it was the Crime Writers Circle, wasn't it?
  Come to think of it, what were you doing there?

Mrs. Lorrimer: Do you know Mr. Shaitana well, Colonel Hughes?
Colonel Hughes: No, not at all. Rather surprised to be invited, as a
  matter of fact. Do you know him?
Mrs. Lorrimer: I know that he likes to be different.
Colonel Hughes: Probably went to the wrong kind of school, eh?

Hercule Poirot: Do you know anyone here, Madame?
Ariadne Oliver: No, I don't know a soul, but I've made a few
  inquiries.
Hercule Poirot: Oui?
Ariadne Oliver: Yes. That little thing is Anne Meredith, a country
  mouse, up to town. [referring to Major Despard] The dashing major
  can't keep his eyes off her. As a matter of fact, I've got his book
  on my shelf. Oh, what's it called? "Amazonian Idle?" I haven't read
  it yet, but I intend to, because I'm planning to send Sven up the
  jungle.
Hercule Poirot: [puzzled] Sven?
Ariadne Oliver: Sven Hjerson? My DETECTIVE.
Hercule Poirot: Ah.
Ariadne Oliver: Fictional, of course.

Ariadne Oliver: I've no idea who the older lady is, Mrs. Lorrimer,
  but she and the young one [referring to Anne Meredith] have been
  throwing glances at each other in the most odd manner. Who's the
  policeman?
Hercule Poirot: Superintendent Wheeler of Scotland Yard.
Ariadne Oliver: [judging Wheeler's expression] Bowel trouble, that
  would be my guess. And your friend, from the Foreign Office?
Hercule Poirot: Oh, that is Colonel Hughes.
Ariadne Oliver: Secret Service, is he?
Hercule Poirot: [pointedly] Jen sais pas.

Ariadne Oliver: Hm, seems our Mr. Shaitana is a little bit...
  crime-minded, shall we say? He has the most curious taste. One
  never knows what he's going to find amusing. Might be something...
  cruel.
Hercule Poirot: You mean, peut-être, like the foxhunting?
Ariadne Oliver: No, I meant something more... Oriental.

Mr. Shaitana: Dr. Roberts.
Dr. Roberts: Good to see you, Shaitana. I'm not late, am I? An
  elderly patient called me out. She thought she had a tumor; I
  thought she was depressed.
Mr. Shaitana: And what did you prescribe?
Dr. Roberts: Champagne and oysters at Wilton's. She'll be right as
  rain by tomorrow.
Ariadne Oliver: [to Poirot] Remind me never to go to him if I'm
  poorly.

Mr. Shaitana: Typically a woman's weapon is poison, is it not,
  Poirot?

Hercule Poirot: [to Mrs. Lorimer] I imagine, Madame, that to you
  every incident is as clear as if it was yesterday, like a ghost
  that never goes away.

Hercule Poirot: Do you think Shaitana played any card games?
Major Despard: There is only one game that Shaitana played... a
  low-down game. We all make mistakes. Even you, I dare say, have a
  failure now and then.
Hercule Poirot: Well, the last one was 28 years ago.

[Last line. Poirot is looking at Shaitana's portrait]
Hercule Poirot: So, we have played, and Hercule Poirot, he has won.

Ariadne Oliver: [at the gallery]... Some of these pieces are terribly
  revealing. For instance what do you make of that. [nodding at a
  sculpture]
Hercule Poirot: I do not know what to make of it Madame Oliver.
Ariadne Oliver: Not symmetrical enough for you?

  I know where His Worship's loyalties lie.

Miss Bulstrode: I hope you're enjoying your little sojourn with us,
  Monsieur. I'd hate to think you were bored.
Hercule Poirot: Bored? Pas du tout, Mademoiselle. There does not need
  to be present a crime for the investigator to thrive, non. Pas.
  This school: it is like the world in miniature. It is like the...
  what is the word? The?
Miss Bulstrode: Microcosm.
Hercule Poirot: Just so. Just as in the outside world. Hopes, dreams,
  fears, secrets. This place: so full of the promise of youth, the
  future of the nation. And yet, how lonely and silent are it's
  corridors at night. Lonely and silent as the chambers of the heart.
  The daily struggle of human life. As fascinating as the bloodstain
  or the fingerprint.

Inspector Kelsey: Bad business, this.
Miss Bulstrode: We shall weather it, no doubt. As we've weathered
  many storms.
Inspector Kelsey: Death of a games mistress in a sports pavilion.
  Sounds like a highly athletic crime.
Miss Bulstrode: It's scratching, Inspector, is the key, don't you

  Rosalie might be? And as for Linnet Doyle, well, she was just so
  beautiful.
Ferguson: [to Poirot, laughing] Do you know that Cornelia's father

Hercule Poirot: The victim. One must always return to the victim. For
  their personality, their nature, it, it is the key. What has
  everybody told to Poirot about Madamoiselle Joyce Reynolds? Huh?
  She is a liar, a teller of the tall tales, a boaster, a little
  liar. So when she claims to have witnessed the murder, nobody
  believes her. And yet, she is... dead.

District Judge: James Gordon Bentley, you have been tried for murder.
  Abigail McGinty was found by the baker on the floor of the
  sitting-room with extensive wounds to the head. The house in
  Broadhinny evinced no sign of forced entry. All the police surgeon
  was able to ascertain was that she'd been hit with a sharp, heavy
  implement, probably some time the night before. You, Bentley, were
  suspected from the very beginning. You knew where she kept her
  money; you had recently lost your employment, and then the
  investigating officer, Superintendent Spence, found sixty pounds in
  legal tender under a stone by the garden path. So you had the
  motive, and you had the opportunity.

Spence: Does anyone really commit murder for the reasons we've been
  considering?
Hercule Poirot: Ah. The passion for respectability it is very strong,
  Superintendent. These are not artists or bohemians. No, very nice
  people live in Broadhinny. They tell to me so themselves.

  were in the barracks by midnight, but Poirot has proved this to be
  false. At a quarter to one in the morning you were seen over two
  miles away in the company of the woman who died. General, this is
  not a murder, as is suggested by the Palestinian police, but I do
  believe the lieutenant lied about his whereabouts, first out of
  panic and then, by sticking to this *lie*, but reinforcing it with
  *lie* after *lie* for weeks and weeks of deception, he has heaped
  suspicion and a deep shame on himself, his regiment, and his wife.
  General, the neck of this woman was not broken by the human hand
  but by a fall.

Hector MacQueen: I met Mr Ratchett when I was on my uppers in, um...
  Iraq we call it now, don't we? He needed a personal assistant who
  was good with languages, which I am, and he paid well.

Hercule Poirot: Mesdames, Messieurs. What I am about to do may
  surprise you a little. It may occur to you that I am eccentric -
  perhaps mad. Ah! You may say, the little Belgian detective is
  taking leave of his rocker, hein. But I can assure you, behind my
  madness is, as you English say... method.

Hercule Poirot: If God should withhold His mercy from anyone on
  Earth, Monsieur, it surely will be you.

Hercule Poirot: Do you know that the priest, when he is buried, he is
  always facing his parishoners? Oui. Because when the Day of
  Judgment, it comes, and the dead, they all arise, he can greet
  them, and lead them through the Gates of Paradise. Tis a beautiful
  idea.
Rosaleen: He shan't be leading me.
Hercule Poirot: You must not say that, ma chere. Despair is a sin.
Rosaleen: I'm cut off from the mercy of God.
Hercule Poirot: No. No one is cut off from the mercy of God... ever.

Adela Marchmont: What marvelous square furniture, Monsieur!
Hercule Poirot: Not a curve in the place, Madame.

Rosaleen: I'm just a simple farm girl; I never wanted any of this.
  Holy Mother and all the saints, sir, but I'm a wicked bitch!

Hercule Poirot: This woman in the scarf, Madame: she was up the
  stairs or down?
Mrs. Leadbetter: She was scuttling down, having leeched the vital
  juices from your customer in number three.

Hercule Poirot: Poirot, he sees things, Madame. It is a habit he
  cannot change.

Hercule Poirot: Two deaths. But neither of them were acts of murder.
  But today, Mes Amis, Poirot shall produce a murderer of whose
  viciousness he stands in awe.

Hercule Poirot: There was no accident of gas in Munn Street. No no
  no. A letter received today from Scotland Yard contained the expert
  forensic evidence confirming my suspicions. There was only the
  premeditated explosion of a bomb! A device built and operated by
  you, David Hunter! Engineer and road builder! How depraved! God,
  how evil does a man have to be to cause the slaughter of so many
  innocent people? For the concealment of a single murder? If God
  should withhold his mercy from anyone on earth, Monsieur, it surely
  will be you.

Hercule Poirot: But the lady presently watching you from over there,
  she is not your sister.
Dr Lionel Cloade: Good heavens!
Hercule Poirot: No. Her name is Eileen Corrigan, a simple farm girl,
  as she defined herself to me at the church. And, whatever the
  papers may say, she did not die in Mayfair two years ago. No. But
  the real Rosaleen Cloade; she did. WHY? Because you murdered her!
  More than any Cloade, you hated Rosaleen. For in her happy marriage
  to Gordon Cloade, she had excluded you; your first love; your
  little sister had surrendered herself to another man. But you had
  already made your own arrangements to deal with her, for you had
  drawn under your spell a parlour maid, who was young, Irish, and in
  the service of your sister. Her name? Eileen Corrigan. You had
  seduced her. Had deliberately impregnated her. And had had the baby
  disposed of.
David Hunter: Not true.
Hercule Poirot: True! Outside of the church, Eileen Corrigan told me
  that she had been cut off from the mercy of God!
David Hunter: She miscarried...
Hercule Poirot: No, Monsieur! She endured abortion! As it was always
  your intention that she should. You wanted to crush the very soul
  of this simple Catholic girl. To make her so terrified by the state
  of her own life that she would deliver it to you. Maintained by
  morphine, ruled by terror; Eileen Corrigan would do whatever you
  told her to do. Why? WHY? Because you, Monsieur, offered her
  salvation if she did. And... the fires of hell if she did not.

Chief Inspector Japp: May I introduce Hercule Poirot, the private
  detective, and his associate Captain Hastings.
Hercule Poirot: The American crime buster, hm?
FBI Agent Burt: Japp, I hope you're not so short of manpower you're
  hiring a shamus. What are they good for... chasing lost dogs. This
  is a matter of international security we're dealing with here.
Chief Inspector Japp: I have no intention of hiring anyone, Burt. And
  if you must know Mr. Poirot here has an outstanding reputation.
FBI Agent Burt: Oh... a gumshoe... of distinction. And I suppose Al
  Capone's running for president.

Hercule Poirot: [Referring to suspect Carla Romero whose flat the FBI
  and Scotland Yard have staked out] Monsieur Burt, I understand that
  she has had some dealings with the Mafia.
FBI Agent Burt: When will you guys understand, there is no such thing
  as the "Mafia" or the "Black Hand" or the "Cosa Nostra." Sure
  there's some immigrant families of mainly Southern European
  extraction who push each other around, but organized crime, *no
  sir*!

Hercule Poirot: You see, Agent Burt. Sometimes a lost dog can be
  found in a place so conspicuous it is the last to be considered.

Newsreel Voice: British pies are famous the world over, and last year
  Farley's Foods produced five million of 'em. Everything from steak
  and kidney to Cornish pasty. But that's not enough for old man
  Farley; he wants to double the score. Work's been pushing ahead on
  the new extension to his factory, and this week the great day
  dawns.

Captain Hastings: Miss Lemon says he makes pies.
Hercule Poirot: Makes pies! Hastings, to say that Benedict Farley
  makes pies is like saying that... Wagner wrote semi-quavers.

  could be just once more together... just one more...
John Christow: You? You planned it?
Veronica Cray: Oh, you belong to me, John. You're mine.
John Christow: When I was a young man, I WANTED you to share my life
  and you wouldn't do it!
Veronica Cray: Because MY career was so much more important than
  yours. I mean, anyone can be a "doctor"!
John Christow: You're a nasty piece of work...

Edward Angkatell: What you really mean is that you won't marry me
  becasue of John Christow. Why doesn't the fellow get a divorce?
Henrietta Savernake: Because!
Edward Angkatell: That's it, isn't it? If there were no John Christow
  in the world, you'd marry me...

John Christow: Would you give it all up, if I asked you to, and come
  and live with me?
Henrietta Savernake: No.
John Christow: No?
Henrietta Savernake: That's not really what you want.
John Christow: Couldn't you lie to me just once?
Henrietta Savernake: Why?
John Christow: Because I love you, Henrietta, but you're so... you're
  so detached. Your art, your cars, your friends... I want you to
  think only of me.
Henrietta Savernake: Isn't that what Gerda does?
John Christow: Don't tell me you care a damn about Gerda!
Henrietta Savernake: Why not? I like Gerda.

John Christow: [last words before dying] Henrietta...

Henrietta Savernake: I'm not, Mr. Poirot, terribly truthful.
Hercule Poirot: No, but I think you have integrity.

Lady Angkatell: I just don't know what to do about lunch. It seems so
  heartless to be sitting around a table stuffing oneself as if
  nothing had happened.
Edward Angkatell: Don't worry on my account, Lucy.
Lady Angkatell: [laughs] Bless you, dear Edward. Say what you will,
  murder is a very awkward thing. It upsets the servants so, puts the
  whole routine out, and, worst of all, it was duck for lunch, my
  very very favorite.

Inspector Grange: You were an eyewitness. You saw everything.
Hercule Poirot: Mais, I saw... but... the eyes of eyewitnesses are so
  unreliable. Sometimes the eyes they see what they are meant to see.

Hercule Poirot: It's a hard thing to kill the one you love, n'est

# "Agatha Christie's Poirot" (1989) {The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (#7.1)}
Hercule Poirot: A man may labor and toil to attain a certain kind of
  leisure in retirement. And then find that, after all, he yearns for
  the old busy days, and the old occupations he had thought himself
  so glad to leave. I had already begun to miss the daily toil of my
  previous employment when, tout à coup, I was flung back into the
  midst of the most perversely fascinating work that there is in the
  world: the study of human nature. A journal came into my
  possession, in which a murderer had taken the trouble to record for
  posterity, the thoughts that had accompanied a crime most
  dastardly. Rarely have I come across such bitterness, such envy and
  contempt of others, such haughtiness misplaced.

Hercule Poirot: [reading from the murderer's journal] "Our village,
  Kings Abbott, is I imagine, very much like any other English
  village. A chilly medieval church stands at the top of a single
  street of stone-built cottages. At the bottom of the street, a
  bridge crosses a stream where the snotty-nosed offspring of the
  poor perfect the most advanced skill they will ever possess.
  Although to the casual observer, Kings Abbott is a friendly place,
  everything is not as it seems. Just scratch the surface, and you
  will find more jealousies and rivalries than ancient Rome. My
  little book is about the murder of Roger Ackroyd; the events
  leading up to it, the subsequent numbskull investigation, and the
  final revelation to you alone, dear reader, of the guilty party."

Hercule Poirot: Now I give up on you. You shall torment me no longer.
  I will KILL you! [throws vegetable marrow from the garden, and it
  lands near Dr. Sheppard's feet] Sacre - ! My dear doctor, I beg of
  you a thousand pardons, but these vegetable marrows, they have
  driven me to the edges of barbarity! Ah, please to forgive me. I am
  ashamed; I prostrate myself.

Hercule Poirot: When one retires, one hurls oneself into new
  pursuits.

Hercule Poirot: [reading from the murderer's journal] "Our only
  captain of industry is the vulgarian Mr. Roger Ackroyd. The factory
  from which Ackroyd's ill-gotten wealth emanates, encapsulates the
  life we lead here: ferment and turmoil... It is here that he lines
  his pockets by combining unlikely chemicals to make unnecessary
  products while befouling the very air we breathe. He likes to think
  of himself as a scientist."

Caroline Sheppard: [referring to Dorothy Ferrars' death from an
  overdose] I've been thinking about Dottie Ferrars.
Dr. Sheppard: Oh?
Caroline Sheppard: She must have taken the veronal on purpose.
  Remorse.
Dr. Sheppard: [incredulous] Remorse?
Caroline Sheppard: You never would listen to me last year when I told
  you how she poisoned that awful husband of hers. This proves it.

Roger Ackroyd: There is evil in this village, Poirot. Downright evil.

Roger Ackroyd: Look, I might as well tell you this, Poirot. I've
  been, well, in love with Dorothy Ferrars for years. She telephoned
  me yesterday, very upset, wanted to see me. She broke down
  completely. She told me everything: her hatred of that brute of a
  husband, her growing feelings for me, and the dreadful means she'd
  taken to - poison! Murder... cold-blooded murder!

Inspector Davis: I don't know you, sir. What's your name?
Dr. Sheppard: This is Hercule Poirot, Inspector. [Inspector looks at
  the Doctor blankly] The famous detective?
Inspector Davis: [suspiciously] Oh yes? What are you doing here?

Lieutenant Hastings: My dear fellow, after the joys of France, that's

Hercule Poirot: [talking to other Belgian refugees about a
  wildflower] Another example of the English bucolic belief -
  anagallis arvensis, the scarlet pimpernel. It is believed that when
  this flower is open, it is a sign of a proplonged spell of fine
  weather. It is seldom seen open in this country.

Lieutenant Hastings: [referring to the false beard they have
  discovered] Who put it there?
Hercule Poirot: Someone with a great deal of intelligence, Hastings.
  He chose to hide it in the one place where its presence would not
  be remarked. But we must be even more intelligent that he does not
  suspect us of being intelligent at all.
Lieutenant Hastings: Absolutely.

John Cavendish: Not guilty.

Mrs. Emily Inglethorp: I've told you before.
John Cavendish: It's none of your business.
Mrs. Emily Inglethorp: It is my business. Not content with carrying
  on this sordid affair with this woman, I now find you squandering
  large sums of money on her.
John Cavendish: It's not a large sum of money. It's a loan, anyway.
Mrs. Emily Inglethorp: No! No! My mind is made up and you need not
  think that any fear of scandal between husband and wife will deter
  me.

Hercule Poirot: Why? When? There must have been something of great
  importance in that case, something that would have connected the
  murder with the crime.
Lieutenant Hastings: But what?
Hercule Poirot: That I do not know.

Hans Meyer [letter]: [voiceover] My dear Horace; We were all
  disappointed not to see you at our conference in Berlin. England is
  in danger of becoming isolated, you know. Many interesting
  developments were discussed, in particular Sir Reuben Astwell's new
  Astoprene compound. It's rumoured that Farben's over here will
  manufacture it under license. But then, you know what gossips
  scientists can be.

Captain Hastings: I've never known you place much faith in intuition.
Hercule Poirot: Intuition, Hastings, often describes some fact that
  is so deeply buried in the subconscious that the subject is not
  aware of its existence.

Miss Lemon: [as Hastings prepares to tee off] Captain Hastings!
  [swinging her pendant] A hole in one, Captain Hastings, a hole in

Hercule Poirot: Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings possesses far too much

Captain Hastings: Quite right, Poirot.

Captain Hastings: I say!

Jewellery Store Owner: Stop, thief!

Hercule Poirot: They fear me, Hastings. The criminals, they fear
  Hercule Poirot so much that they have repented of their naughty
  ways and have become citizens of the most upright.

Hercule Poirot: Why did you wish to know where Monsieur Lavington
  lives, Hastings?
Captain Hastings: I don't know. He was so beastly, the way he talked
  about Lady Millicent, I wanted to kick him down the stairs, huh.
Hercule Poirot: You wanted to do it in the comfort of his own home,
  yes?

Chief Inspector Japp: [watching Hasting's model boat sail] Did you

Barton Russell: Don't be. Two years almost to the day.
Barton Russell: [to the grave] He will rest, Iris. I swear it.

Captain Hastings: Is there *anything* in the English cuisine that you
  like, Poirot?
Hercule Poirot: The English they do not have a cuisine, my friend,
  they have only the food.
Captain Hastings: Well, that's a bit harsh, i...
Hercule Poirot: Like the meat, overcooked, the vegetables too soft,
  the cheese inedible. And the day the English create their own wines
  is the day I return home to Belgium.

[last lines]
Captain Hastings: [giving Poirot a chip wagon serving of fish and
  chips] English cuisine. There's nothing like it in the world! You

Hercule Poirot: I assure you, this is how she is.

Hercule Poirot: Where there is murder, anything can happen.

Sir Roderick Horsfield: Oh, ah, why, We're having a... a little house
  party this weekend. Perhaps you'd like to come?
Hercule Poirot: I would be most honored.
Sir Roderick Horsfield: Um, d-do you have a woman in tow?
Hercule Poirot: No.
Sir Roderick Horsfield: Well, bring her along anyway.

Hercule Poirot: Let the game be played out.

Ariadne Oliver: You do think of things, don't you?
Hercule Poirot: Ah.
Ariadne Oliver: What a calculating mind!... And tortorous! That's
  what I call it - tortorous!
Hercule Poirot: Am I so calculating, Madame? Am I a solver of puzzles
  with a heart that is cold? Or are we looking at the greatest of
  mysteries that life ever throws up... the mystery that even I,
  Hercule Poirot, will never be able to solve - the nature of love.

Hercule Poirot: The fact that I discovered nothing means there is a
  great deal being concealed.

Hercule Poirot: [furious] What have *I* done? It is *you* who have
  deceived *me*!

Sir Charles Cartwright: You don't know what it's like. People think
  we're so happy, so glamorous. Girls run after you, beautiful girls.
  You kiss them, and then they go home. Take off their pretty
  costumes, and they go home, and you're alone.

Sir Charles Cartwright: Ready about. Go about.

Sir Charles Cartwright: [describing guests] Then last, and in every

Claude Langton: But I haven't heard anything about a murder.
Hercule Poirot: No, you would not have heard of it. Because, as yet,
  it has not taken place. You see, if one can investigate a murder
  before it happens, then one might even, well, a little idea...
  prevent it?

John Harrison: [seeing Poirot] Well, I'll be jiggered!
Molly Deane: What is it?
John Harrison: I'd know that egghead anywhere.

Captain Hastings: [referring to Poirot] You know what he's like when
  he hasn't had a case for a few weeks. I thought that a nice
  afternoon at the Garden Fete might cheer him up a bit.
Chief Inspector Japp: Hmmm, about the only thing that's going to
  cheer him up today is the discovery of a body in the Lucky Dip.
  [Hastings and Japp laugh]

Hercule Poirot: [to Japp, referring to Hastings' new camera] The new
  toy. I give it two, perhaps three weeks.

Hercule Poirot: [after being stung by a wasp] The open air, it should
  be closed during the summer! Captain Hastings, he wonders why I
  have a hatred for these crawling, buzzing things. And the reason is
  they're always trying to kill me!

Hercule Poirot: Certainment, this is the most difficult moment of my
  career. To solve the crime... that does not exist.

Hercule Poirot: I see you have had some tea, n'est ce pas? You
  remember the Garden Fete? When I look into the future? You will
  permit if we do the same, please? Turn it around... no, no, no, no,
  no! Because this time, it is different. This time we shall look
  backward, yes? Into the past. Because the past, it is as clear as
  crystal, n'est ce pas? As clear as the crystals of cyanide poison
  that are in this cup. Oh, no, no, no, m'sieu, this does not shock
  you. For it is you who put them there!

Chief Inspector Japp: Sorry about this, Poirot. I thought as she was
  here visiting with her sister it would be a simple matter for her

Doña Juana Arellano viuda de Manrique: I heard about your little
  adventure with Marina last night.
Diego Arellano, Conde de Guevara: Wasn't that much of an adventure.
  She was so delicate it was like screwing a doll. I prefer the
  hookers.

Catalina Escobar y Díaz: When your done with my bath I want you to
  begin the washing.
María Hipólita Díaz de Guzmán: Should I curtsy or do you want me to
  kiss your feet?

Antonio de Guzmán y Pantoja: I told you I didn't want you associating
  with those hookers anymore.
Perla: They're the only friends I have. Who else would you have me
  talk to? Do you really think the high and mightly noble ladies will
  want to talk to me?
Antonio de Guzmán y Pantoja: Don't be upset, I'm sorry. I had no
  right.

María Hipólita Díaz de Guzmán: What did you do to try to find Rafael?
Antonio de Guzmán y Pantoja: I told you! I notified the police and
  let them do their job.
María Hipólita Díaz de Guzmán: But you didn't search for him
  yourself! Admit it, you don't love him!


# "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1959)
John Newland: [episode introduction] What you are about to see is a
  matter of human record. Explain it: we cannot. Disprove it: we
  cannot. We simply invite you to explore with us the amazing world
  of the Unknown... to take that One Step... Beyond.

John Newland: [closing statement] Next week, and every week, we'll be
  bringing you the personal records of the rarest kind of human
  experience: man's adventure in the world of the unknown, that
  mysterious psychic world beyond our five senses. This is your
  invitation to take with us that astonishing... one step beyond.


# "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1959) {Encounter (#2.29)}
Blake: Perhaps half of believing is being able to accept the unusual.


# "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1959) {Make Me Not a Witch (#2.14)}
[introduction]
John Newland: Have you ever been certain your telephone would ring in
  the next ten seconds? Or have you ever walked down a strange street
  and had the feeling that you knew what lay beyond the unturned
  corner? Yes? Then you've had a brief encounter with the world of
  the unknown. You are ready for the actual human experience that
  follows.

[first lines]
Mrs. Horvath: Emmy, time to set the table.

John Newland: Emmy Horvath, age 12. Farm girl. Helping her mother
  with the chores. How perfectly normal. Certainly a most unlikely
  channel for the supernormal, the psychic, isn't she? But don't you
  believe it.

[last lines]
Jed Horvath: Emmy, I was never mad at you. Well, mostly I was just
  scared.

[afterword]
John Newland: Scared? Of what? Of a strange gift that was given for
  just a little while? Of a gift that saved the lives of two
  children. A man frightened of a miracle. How much more frightening,
  how really terrifying, if there were no miracles.


# "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1959) {Reunion (#2.10)}
Helga: Oh, Theo, what happened to us?
Theo: What we let happen.


# "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1959) {The Captain's Guests (#1.19)}
[first lines]
John Newland: Have you ever had the feeling that you knew what
  someone was going to say just before he said it? Or have you ever
  walked into a strange room and had the sensation that you'd been
  there before? Well if you have, you've taken a small step beyond.

John Newland: No inanimate object can have a personality we are told.
  But we forget... for example, we look at a house and we say it's
  cheerful, melancholy, gloomy. Now what we're doing, of course, is
  simply describing our own reactions. There are some cases, however,
  that seem to defy this handy explanation. On the New England coast,
  even today, there are certain houses which can be classified only
  as... unfriendly.

[Andrew wants to rent an old New England mansion, but Ellen isn't so
  sure]
Ellen Courtney: Honey, let's go.
Andrew Courtney: Let's go? Let's go in!


# "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1959) {The Last Round (#3.16)}
John Newland: Everything in this room could tell a hundred stories,
  but this boxing glove was involved in a most unusual occurrence
  when on September 17, 1944 that dark and heavy curtain to the world
  beyond our five senses - the psychic world - was lifted for a
  moment.


# "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1959) {The Vision (#1.10)}
Major Lamarr: [to Capt. Tremaine] Cheer up, Captain. You did a good
  job. Better than they *deserved*.

Sergeant Vy: [to Capt. Tremaine] If I had told them that I saw Noah's
  Ark pass by, would *that* have saved us?


# "Alejo y Valentina" (2002)
Carlitox: Hello, I come here to float!

Alejo: Valentine, smell my greeze arm.
Valentina: Mmm.

El Viejo: I've got bulletproof vest, y'see

El Viejo: But, are you crazy, y'see?


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955)
[Hitchcock arrives for his introduction dressed in a safari outfit
  and pith helmet]
Himself - Host: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
  darkest Hollywood. Night brings a stillness to the jungle. It is so
  quiet, you can hear a name drop. The savage beasts have already
  begun gathering at the water holes to quench their thirst. Now one
  should be especially alert. The vicious table-hopper is on the
  prowl, and the spotted back-biter may lurk behind a potted palm. To
  take me through this most savage of lands, I have hired a native
  guide.
[He snaps his fingers. An old man joins him, wearing a billboard sign
  that reads, "Maps of the Movie Stars' Homes - For Sale"]
Himself - Host: He claims to know where I can find the big ones.

Himself - Host: [introducing commercials at the end of the show] I
  hope you have enjoyed our program. Seeing a murder on television
  can help to work off one's antagonisms. And if you haven't any
  antagonisms, these commercials will give you some.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {A Bottle of Wine (#2.19)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. I came down here because I understand
  that the current year is a very good year for wine. For drinking
  it, that is. I'm looking for some champagne. "Not to be taken
  internally." Oh. "For bathing only." Fortunately, my tastes aren't
  so expensive. I bathe in ginger beer. That way one doesn't have to
  add a softener. All this is by way of introducing tonight's play.
  It is called, by an extraordinary coincidence, "A Bottle of Wine."

[first lines]
Judge: Oh, Grace.
Grace: Hello, Judge. I came to get my clothes.
Judge: So you're going. You're really going after all.

Judge: Ten years, and one word seems to take care of it all.
  "Nothing." Such a merciless word.

Judge: Why is it that the less use people have another human being,
  the politer they become to him? Relentlessly polite.

[last lines]
Grace: We never had a honeymoon in Spain, Wallace. There was nothing
  wrong with that bottle of sherry.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Forsooth. Such knavery. Naturally the police
  apprehended Wallace and he paid for his ungentlemanly conduct.
  After all, one should not shoot one's host before dinner. This
  concludes our little preachment on the evils of drink. Tune in next
  time, when we shall again present a charming little horrific fairy
  tale. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {A Bullet for Baldwin (#1.14)}
[showing a gun]
Alfred Hitchcock: It is an amazingly simple device. An idiot can
  operate it, and indeed, many do.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {A Little Sleep (#2.38)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [upside down] Good evening. This is Alfred
  Hitchcock speaking to you from the bottom of the world. I mention
  this so that if snow should appear on your screen, you won't waste
  time adjusting your set. Ah. [a St. Bernard with a barrel around
  its neck walks on] Man's best friend. And a dog, too. Even though I
  have all the comforts of home, I'm afraid it is time for our play,
  and I wouldn't want everyone to watch this standing on his head.
  [snaps fingers; suddenly he's right side up and the dog is gone]
  Well, we seem to have lost the dog, but it's nice to feel the blood
  rushing to my feet again. Ladies and gentlemen, here, proper side
  up, is our story, "A Little Sleep."

[first lines]
Barbie Hallem: Lover, you dance like a gigolo.

[last lines]
Benny Mungo: You know, Marcella said the very same thing last night
  just before I put her to sleep.
Barbie Hallem: You put her...
Benny Mungo: Just like I did Ed. I do it real quick. I'll show you.
Barbie Hallem: [screams]

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: And he did, too. Naturally, Benny was properly
  punished as is always the case on this program. Next time we shall
  be back again with more crime and punishment. Pax vobiscum.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {A Man Greatly Beloved (#2.33)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. [A boy walks into a wicker basket.
  Hitchcock puts swords through it, then looks inside.] Good heavens.
  He looks like a toothpick holder on an hors d'oeuvre table. I guess
  I'll just have to practice some more. So much for the sideshow.
  Now, turn your attention to the center ring where you will find our
  main attraction.

[first lines]
Hildegard Fell: [to the camera] My name is Hildegard. Hildegard Fell.
  I'm writing about my hometown, Essington, Massachusetts and
  especially about Mr. Anderson. Mr. John Anderson. I'm trying to be
  absolutely honest about everybody, including myself, and that's the
  hardest part of all. My mother and father don't understand me. No
  one does really. My father is a minister, and it's not nice to
  criticize him. But I think he's just the teensiest bit too
  good-looking for a minister. Now, my mother, she's not a bit too
  beautiful. She's just right. Someday when my teeth grow back in,
  I'll probably look just like her.

[last lines]
Hildegard Fell: [to the camera] And Mr. Anderson was a man greatly
  beloved. He did good things and never told on anyone, even when
  they told on him. He was the kindest man I ever knew, next to my
  father.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Thus ends tonight's story. After seeing it, I think
  you'll treat your neighbor more kindly. After all, he may be a
  former ax murderer. Of course, there's nothing to worry about. He's
  probably out of practice. I hope you'll join us next time when we
  shall present another story of mystery and/or suspense. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Alibi Me (#2.7)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening.
[reacts to shrill humming]
Alfred Hitchcock: Some of our late viewers tuning in. One of the
  commonest questions that people ask of a producer of mystery motion
  pictures is, "Which is written first, the words or the music?" In
  our case, the background music always comes first. After it is
  written, we sprinkle the score liberally with sound effects, and
  then hire an author to write appropriate scenes to accompany the
  music, quiet scenes to coincide with the somber passages, and
  scenes of violence to synchronize with the noisier sections.
  Finally, we garnish this potpourri with a title composed of from
  one to four words, selected because they are eye-catching and
  provocative. And we arrange them in a manner designed to titillate
  and confuse. Let me show you what one of our stories sounds like
  before it is written.
[Hitchcock waves a baton as we hear women screaming, gunfire, burglar
  alarms, police sirens, crashes, etc.]
Alfred Hitchcock: How fortissimo can you get? I trust this has been
  educational. I deliberately cut that number short because it was
  the music for tonight's story, "Alibi Me," and I didn't want you to
  know how it comes out. If you haven't already guessed, here is the
  way it begins.

[first lines]
Lucky Moore: No knock on the door? No "Can I come in please?" Just no
  class.
Georgie Minnelli: I want a showdown!

[last lines]
Messenger Boy: Oh, I almost forgot. There's a message goes with the
  lollipop. "To the biggest sucker in town."

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Well, that was a surprise. The pistol shot Georgie
  used to kill Lucky wasn't in the original score. But that's what
  happens when the musician who plays the revolver is allowed to
  improvise. Naturally, Georgie was given life imprisonment, while
  the offending musician got off with a 10-year-sentence. Next time,
  we plan to bring you more music and sound effects and another story
  to accompany them. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {And So Died Riabouchinska (#1.20)}
Himself - Host: Good evening. This misty bit of ectoplasm forming on
  the inside of your television screen is one Alfred Hitchcock,
  coming to you tonight from across that great barrier that divides
  the quick from the dead: the Atlantic Ocean. I have materialized
  tonight for the express purpose of warning you; that during
  tonight's seance, you will witness a playlet entitled "And So Died
  Riabouchinska". But first, I would like to make an announcement to
  those of you who can't stay until the end... the butler did it.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Conversation Over a Corpse (#2.8)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [wearing a chef's hat] Good evening. Tonight we
  offer you a generous portion of mystery, a pinch of comedy, just a
  soupcon of a commercial, all seasoned by a few irrelevant comments
  from your host. As you may know, food is a hobby of mine. I don't
  claim to be an expert cook, but I am rather a good eater. If you
  will wander into my kitchen, I'll allow you to watch me as I
  concoct some delicacy to tempt your palate.
[camera follows him to what looks like a science lab]
Alfred Hitchcock: I cannot abide careless cookery. Let me see. I've,
  uh, I've just added 10 cc's of sugar. All that is left is to add
  the white of one egg. And by the white, I do not refer to the clear
  gelatinous substance inside. Naturally, I mean the shell. This is
  where most amateur cooks make their mistakes. While you are waiting
  for me to finish, I suggest you turn your attention to tonight's
  story. It is called "Conversation Over a Corpse." It sounds like
  perfect dinner conversation.

[first lines]
Cissie Enright: [singing snatches of a song] Who laughed with
  delight... You... frown... In the old churchyard... Gave her a
  smile... And trembled... And alone... [Joanna enters] Oh, it's you,
  Joanna.

Joanna Enright: Maybe we could take him out in sections.
Cissie Enright: Sections? Oh. But wouldn't that be terribly untidy? I
  mean, mama's rug.

Joanna Enright: He's alive! Oh, what a nuisance this is. Now we have
  to kill him again.

Cissie Enright: [brings out bug spray] If just a little will kill a
  fly, a whole can will do Mr. Brenner. It will be neat and very
  sanitary, too.

Cissie Enright: We could poison him again, but we've used up all the
  capsules.
Joanna Enright: I know! Weed killer! We didn't use it all on the
  roses.

Joanna Enright: Cissie, there's plenty of it. And it says on the
  label, "70% arsenic." How do you think we ought to give it to him?
Cissie Enright: Oh, with orange juice, I should think. That's the way
  I always take those nasty medicines.

[last lines]
Cissie Enright: Thank you, Mr. Brenner, for telling the police
  exactly what happened. My, my, I hope they hurry. Everything's so
  upset.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: She was no sissy. As a matter of fact, that was her
  downfall. She wanted to steady her nerves before the police came,
  so she took a few slugs. Very sad. Except for the newspapers who
  detected a love triangle. The picture papers had a more fun than at
  a hanging. Well, so much for tonight's cooking demonstration. I
  hope I've made everything clear. Next time, I shall show you how to
  prepare an exotic delicacy. White hunter à la Mau Mau. You'll be
  the talk of your neighborhood. I shall also reveal one of my own
  culinary secrets, how to remove the wrapper from a frozen food
  package without tearing the directions. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Crack of Doom (#2.9)}
[opening narration]
Alfred Hitchcock: Oh, good evening, onlookers. I seem to be stuck. I
  don't suppose you see a place for a red seven. No, of course not.
  This program isn't in color. That's right. You can't distinguish
  colors, can you? There's nothing to winning, really. That is, if
  you happen to be blessed with a keen eye, an agile mind and no
  scruples whatsoever. Tonight's play is called "The Crack of Doom."
  As the title suggests, "The Crack of Doom" is a story about Mason
  Bridges, his wife, Jessie, his secretary, Della, his friends, Tom
  Ackley and Sam Clinker. And it begins in the club car of a New
  York-Chicago streamliner.

[first lines]
Tom Ackley: Can I get you a fresh one, Mason?
Mason Bridges: Uh, no thanks.

[last lines]
Friend: Bet you for the drinks, Tom.
Tom Ackley: Not on your life, brother.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: I hope you weren't displeased by the lack of
  bloodshed in tonight's story. It's impossible for us to stage a
  murder every night. We're running out of victims. Of course, we
  could replenish our supply by changing this into an
  audience-participation show. However, for the present, at least, I
  think we'll muddle along the old way. That's all for tonight. Next
  time I appear, we shall have another story to tell you. And I hope
  you will allow us to come into your living room. It's, uh, terribly
  stuffy, closed up in this dusty television set. Good night.

Sam Klinker: Mason, friendship ceases when the first card is dealt.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Crackpot (#2.15)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening.
Echo: Good evening.
Alfred Hitchcock: [whispering] Good evening. Certain parties have
  been objecting to my candid remarks. So, I'm doing tonight's show
  from this sealed chamber. It's as quiet as a tomb. Which is not
  surprising...
Echo: Good evening.
Alfred Hitchcock: ... since it was the only type of structure
  available that suited our...
Echo: Certain parties have been objecting to my candid remarks. So, I
  am doing tonight's show from this sealed chamber. Which is not
  surprising.
Alfred Hitchcock: Are you quite finished?... Here, in a moment, is
  tonight's play. It is entitled "Crackpot."
Echo: Are you quite finished?
[Hitchcock shrugs and sits down, defeated]

[first lines]
Ray Loomis: Oh, what about that, huh?
Meg Loomis: What about what?
Ray Loomis: You get a honeymoon once in your life, and I have to get
  a flat tire.
Meg Loomis: Do you mean me, darling?

[last lines]
Moon: That's pretty stupid. It'll ruin the whole plan. Forgot to shut
  off the alarm.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: We wanted to withhold the end of that story, but
  decided it was better that you learn the truth about Ray Loomis now
  than later. [someone punches a hole through the wall] I knew it.
  It's the ITA. It's futile to try to escape. We shall be back soon
  with another play. Don't you try to escape. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {De Mortuis (#2.3)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening, students of the macabre. This
  evening's lecture has as its text the short story "De Mortuis"
  translated from the Latin. This means "about the dead." At the risk
  of being facetious, I would like to point out that Latin is a dead
  language. Thank you. It is rewarding to know that there are still a
  few students interested in achieving high marks. If you can't hear
  me in the back of the room, please raise your hand and adjust the
  volume control. Regrettably, the author wrote only his title in
  Latin, and did the story in English. Writers are always
  compromising to attain commercial success. I shall leave it to your
  judgment as to whether or not it would have sounded better in
  Latin.

[first lines]
Bud: Anybody home? Eh, prof? Prof, fish are biting right now. What
  about it? You in here? Guess he's not home.

[last lines]
Irene Rankin: Well, what is it?

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: And so, just like many a Hollywood movie star,
  Irene Rankin was immortalized in concrete. But Professor Rankin was
  not so fortunate. He remarried. His crime was later discovered and
  he paid the supreme penalty. I have asked one of the actors to come
  out after the show, for I want to congratulate him on a splendid
  performance, and I'm sure you do, too. He played the most ferocious
  of the rats, a characterization that was quite a departure for him.
  Offstage, he's entirely different, as you can see. He's a family
  man, never seen in the nightclubs. He's just like the fellow who
  lives next door to you.
[the rat squeaks]
Alfred Hitchcock: Thank you. We have another story. Oh, here it is.
  But, um, I'm afraid there isn't time enough to present it. We'll
  have to do it next time. Until then, good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Enough Rope for Two (#3.7)}
Joe Kedzie: You cut the rope!

Madge Griffin: I'll lower the money down, you'll have the money!
Joe Kedzie: Yeah, $100,000 with a broken leg 40 feet down a mine in
  the middle of the desert!

Joe Kedzie: You've got yourself $100,000, Blanche, buy yourself
  something with it. Buy the key to a second hand car!


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Fatal Figures (#3.29)}
Margaret Goames: [Handing a bottle of perfume to Harold] What's this?
Harold George Goames: I like to think it came from Bulgaria. They say
  the largest rose fields in all the world are located in the Maritza
  valley. And the maidens gather the flowers early in the morning
  while the dew is still fresh upon them.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Father and Son (#2.36)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [carrying a bow and arrow] Good evening. Have you,
  um, seen a small boy with an apple on his head? I know he's around
  here somewhere, but my eyes aren't what they used to be. Oh, oh,
  there he is. [shoots the arrow off-screen] I missed again. I think
  I'd better quit. I even missed the boy that time. Tonight, the
  flickering shadows on our magic lantern screen tell a story of life
  in the big city. It is called, "Father and Son."

[first lines]
Sam Saunders: What's this supposed to be for?
Joe Saunders: Well, you said you had to have some more money.

[last lines]
Joe Saunders: Did you hurt yourself, son? Did you hurt yourself?

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Unfortunately, he wasn't. Sam was one of those
  person for whom all things seem to work out well. No matter what
  happens to him, he always manages to land on his head. That's all
  for tonight. Next time, we plan a similar foray into your parlor. I
  hope you'll be home. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Fog Closing In (#2.2)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening, friends and others. Tonight... Madam,
  some of our audience are having difficulty in seeing. Would you
  mind?
[woman in foreground removes her head]
Alfred Hitchcock: Thank you. On the theory that what was good enough
  for Shakespeare is good enough for us, we planned to open tonight's
  play with a maid soliloquizing as she dusts. Unfortunately, tonight
  happens to be the maid's night out. I'm expecting an important
  call.
[phone rings]
Alfred Hitchcock: It must be Scotland Yard calling.
[into phone]
Alfred Hitchcock: Yes? Thank you. It was. They say I am being
  watched. That's very gratifying for a television performer.
  Tonight's play is entitled "Fog Closing In." Fog.
[fog appears]
Alfred Hitchcock: I don't suppose any of you are familiar with that
  word. It's an American expression meaning... Well, it's really hard
  to explain to anyone who hasn't experienced it. The word has no
  English equivalent. Oh, well, it isn't too important.
[as the fog envelops him]
Alfred Hitchcock: We'd better go on with the play.

[first lines]
Mary Summers: No.
Arthur Summers: Don't worry. It won't go off. I know how to handle a
  gun.

[last lines]
Mary Summers: Yes, daddy. I'm all right now. Now I can come home.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: This concludes our play for tonight. Unhappily for
  Mary Summers, however, there is more to her story, for she
  subsequently found herself in one of those institutions she had
  come to fear. Next time we shall be back with another story. Until
  then, good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Guest for Breakfast (#3.21)}
Eve Ross: I don't care what happens to him.
Chester Lacey: That's the problem! You don't care what happens

Chester Lacey: When they catch me they'll ask me if I'm sorry I did
  it. My wife... yeah, I'm sorry about her, I wish I hadn't have done
  it, but that guy! He had it coming, so did she but it wouldn't have
  happened if it weren't for him!

Jordan Ross: Why *did* you push his arm?
Eve Ross: [crying] You Jordan, me Eve.

Eve Ross: They won't shoot at a woman; they might think I'm your
  wife, wouldn't even stop the car.

Jordan Ross: Your name's Lacy, right? Yes I read about you in the
  paper the other night. When you killed those two people, that was
  without premeditation, wasn't it?
Chester Lacey: Yeah, but it won't matter now anyway.

# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {I Killed the Count: Part 1 (#2.25)}
[introduction]
Suit of Armor: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Alfred
  Hitchcock. [Hitchcock walks on screen] Tonight's play takes place
  in merry old England, and is called "I Killed the Count."
Alfred Hitchcock: When they asked me to wear this, I demurred. I
  didn't realize it would be an invitation for automation to take
  over. [looks inside the helmet] Empty. Now what does that imply?
  Oh, well! Let the play begin.

[first lines]
Polly Stephens: Count Mattoni, your tea.

Inspector Davidson: We seldom indulge in games at Scotland Yard, Mr.
  Froy.

Inspector Davidson: The count was killed last night.
Bernard K. Froy: Yeah, I know. I killed him.

[last lines]
Inspector Davidson: [stammering] Did you say *you* killed him?
Lord Sorrington: Yes, that's right. I killed the count.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Well, this is embarrassing how time is running out
  and here we are with an unfinished story on our hands. I'm afraid
  you'll just have to wait until our next show to find out more about
  just who killed the count. Personally, I shall welcome a week in
  which to think up some answers. After all, Froy and Lord Sorrington
  can't both be telling the truth. There's nothing I detest more than
  a murderer who tells fibs. Next time, we shall continue the strange
  case of Count Victor Mattoni. Thus far, our desperate detectives
  have two very good suspects. But their confessions seem to ask more
  questions than they answer. If all this has managed to pique your
  curiosity, please join us for the next installment. Oh, I know what
  you're thinking. No, I did not kill the count. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {I Killed the Count: Part 2 (#2.26)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. Tonight's play is called "I Killed
  the Count." Now, I know what you're thinking. Last week's play was
  also called "I Killed the Count." And you think tonight's is just a
  revival. On the contrary, since we were unable to finish the story
  last time, we shall have another stab at it tonight. I'd better
  fill in some of the details for those of you who were careless
  enough to miss the first episode. I hope you realize the trouble
  you're putting us to. Just don't let it happen again. First of all,
  Count Victor Mattoni was found quite dead in the living room of his
  London flat. There was a single bullet hole in his forehead. It's
  my personal opinion that this was a contributing factor to his
  death. Inspector Davidson and his assistant Raines, the
  investigating detectives, have uncovered a number of clues. Among
  them, two letters. One led them to a Bernard K. Froy. And another
  written by Lord Sorrington, an industrialist. Before the detectives
  were quite settled down to work, they are faced with an
  embarrassingly oversupply of confessions. For, both Froy and Lord
  Sorrington confessed to a murder that only one of them could have
  committed. I'm certain this is all quite clear. But for the benefit
  of any small children who may have missed some of the plot
  machinations, here to clarify are two brief scenes from our last
  show, after which our story continues.

[first lines]
Lord Sorrington: You see, Inspector, Mattoni was married to my
  daughter, Helen.

Inspector Davidson: Confound it all, I've never had two people
  competing for a murder before.

[last lines]
Mullet: Yes, sir. That's right. I killed the count.
Inspector Davidson: Oh, no. No, no. No, two's enough. Every Tom, Dick
  and Harry who enters this flat telling me he killed the count. I
  don't have to stand for this sort of thing. I won't have it. Do you
  hear? I won't have it!

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Well, we've done it again. We still haven't
  finished the story. How extremely careless of us. But I promise you
  on my honor the truth will be out next time. I've excused the
  actors until we return when they will present the final act of our
  play. Unfortunately, since you are all accessories after the fact,
  I cannot permit you to leave the room. You may, however, discuss
  the case among yourselves. Who killed the count and why? Only one
  person could have done it. Was it Mullet, the liftman? Did Bernard
  Froy do it? Was it Lord Sorrington? Or was it a fourth person? Who
  is the guilty party? Tune in next time and find out. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {I Killed the Count: Part 3 (#2.27)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Those of you
  who have been sitting on the edge of your chairs since last time
  will be glad to know that tonight we shall definitely present the
  final chapter in our story, "I Killed the Count." For those of you
  who have missed the earlier installments, or have lost your
  scorecards, I shall present a résumé. Within a few hours after
  Count Victor Mattoni was found dead in his London flat with a
  single bullet hole in his head, the detectives found themselves
  with three persons, each of whom confessed that he, and he alone,
  killed the count. They were Bernard Froy, an American; Mullet, the
  lift man; and Lord Sorrington, an important industrialist. In each
  case, there is some corroborating evidence. Mullet obligingly left
  his fingerprints on the count's wallet; Froy had written an
  incriminating letter; and Lord Sorrington's pistol was found on the
  scene. There was also a fourth bit of evidence. Skin and blood
  under the count's fingernails, indicated he had scratched his
  assailant, yet none of the three suspects bore any scratches.
  Neither Froy, nor Lord Sorrington, nor... I don't know why I bother
  to explain all of this, for the brief three scenes which preface
  tonight's story will make everything quite clear.

[first lines]
Raines: Excuse me, sir. Inspector, don't you think you ought to talk
  to Mullet now, sir?

[last lines]
Raines: It's lucky he deserved killing, isn't it, sir?

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: I knew we'd finish that story if we kept at it. I'm
  sure Inspector Davidson is longing for the good old days when on
  investigating a robin's death, he simply went out and arrested the
  first sparrow he saw carrying a bow and an empty quiver. A
  policeman's lot is not a happy one. However, the Inspector's
  bulldog spirit did finally pay off, and our little band of
  conspirators eventually faced trial. Fortunately, they were let off
  with light sentences. In fact, when the jury found out what kind of
  a chap the count was, it recommended the defendants for the Order
  of the Garter. This, of course, was the end of our trilogy. Next
  time we shall resume our policy of telling a complete story on each
  program. I hope you will join us then. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Incident in a Small Jail (#6.23)}
Leon Gorwald: Sheriff, please, you've gotta let me out of here! You
  can't keep me locked up!


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {John Brown's Body (#2.14)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [sitting on a giant scale as two men fill the other
  scale with bags of money] Good evening and welcome to "Alfred
  Hitchcock Presents." [to the men] Thank you. See you next year. [to
  the audience] We thought you'd like to see this. So many of you
  have expressed an interest in knowing how I was paid. Now I can
  afford to go back to my diet. Tonight's play is about a body. Not
  mine. However, the title is "John Brown's Body."

[first lines]
Harold Skinner: In my opinion, John, this is the type of furniture we
  should be making.

Vera Brown: He'd be a nervous wreck in no time. Oh, what a horrible
  thought.
Harold Skinner: It was only an idea.
Vera Brown: I think it's a wonderful horrible idea.

Psychiatrist: You know I just came from visiting a dual personality.
  Both of them feel terrible.

[last lines]
Vera Brown: I must take him home.
Psychiatrist: You'd only be taking home his body. His mind is...
  Well, look for yourself.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: I hope that ending was properly terrifying. [looks
  in one of the bags] What's this? Nothing but sawdust. Oh, well, two
  can play at that game. [pats his stomach] That's all I have here.
  This concludes our program for tonight. On our next program, we
  shall both be back. Me and my shadow.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Jonathan (#2.10)}
[opening narration]
Hitchcock's Stand-In: Hiya. I'm not Hitchcock. I'm Alfred, his
  stand-in. Someone has to stand here while the lights and the
  cameras are adjusted and all that stuff, see? And the old boy just
  don't have the time. I got the job 'cause I look like him. That's
  what they say, but not to my face. I see they're rolling him in.
  You suppose I'll look like that when I'm his age?
Alfred Hitchcock: That will be all, Alfred.
Hitchcock's Stand-In: Arrivederci, daddy-O.
Alfred Hitchcock: Cheeky fellow, isn't he? Unfortunately, he may soon
  be more than a stand-in. We are planning to send out a second
  company to tour the provinces, and Alfred will play my part. Which
  brings us to tonight's thrilling shocker. It is called "Jonathan."

[first lines]
Gil Dalliford: [narrating] Everything Jonathan ever told me I
  remember. Even what he said about the water in the boathouse. Was I
  five or six when I asked him about Mother? "The waves," he said.
  "Your mother's dying was like the waves, drawn away by a tide, no
  longer an individual wave, but once again a part of a total
  surface." Every important moment of my life is a moment I had with
  Jonathan. Every incident, everything in this room is a memory of
  Jonathan. This table. We made it together. It took nearly six
  months because Jonathan insisted it had to be perfect. And this,
  for the men's doubles at the club. We'd lost the first set and were
  down four games in the second. And Jonathan looked at me with that
  funny little grin he had, as much as to say, "All right, Gil, it's
  all right. There's still time and we can do it!" And we did. We
  were the perfect team. Why, I wouldn't even call him "Dad" or
  "Father" like the other kids did. To me, he was always Jonathan.
  Jonathan, I was right about Rosine. She made you think I was
  spoiled and unreasonable.

Jonathan Dalliford: A man is entitled to have something of his own.

[last lines]
Rosie Dalliford: So it was you, Gil. You killed Jonathan. You're
  going to have to remember that for the rest of your life.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Those of you who like to see nasty people receive
  their comeuppance, will be delighted with the results of tonight's
  tale. Gil took his story to the police, and he and Rosine were
  promptly punished. She for murder and he for intent to murder.
  There is, however, a brighter side to all this. Both have become
  model prisoners. This concludes tonight's divertissement. But
  please remained tuned to this channel. I am not familiar with the
  program which follows, nor the one after that. But I have seen the
  story we are presenting next time, and I think it's worth waiting
  for. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Kill with Kindness (#2.4)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [tied to a stake, surrounded by a bundle of sticks]
  Good evening. Television fans can be so demonstrative and
  unpredictable. At the time this happened, I was under the
  impression I was being put on a pedestal. My wife's not going to
  like this. She's always telling me not to leave my ashes on the
  floor.
[takes out a cigarette, lights it, throws the match onto the sticks]
Alfred Hitchcock: Tonight, we present a very warm little story called
  "Kill with Kindness."
[as smoke rises]
Alfred Hitchcock: Reception seems to be rather bad tonight. Is your
  screen clouding up? Mine is. I think we better run a test film
  first. If you have no difficulty in seeing it, we will show you our
  story.

[first lines]
Fitzhugh Oldham: Katherine. Katherine, look at this. Here, dear.
  Here. Come quick.

[last lines]
Fitzhugh Oldham: Well, somebody had to do it. See, Mr. Jorgy was
  overcome with smoke and my sister... Well, you know how women are
  in an emergency. Poor Katherine, she always loses her head.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: [steps away from the stake] I thought I'd better
  get out of there. I just remembered that my tumbrel is double
  parked. I shall return next week at the same time to bring you
  another story and to relate the further adventures of Alfred
  Hitchcock. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Malice Domestic (#2.20)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the
  first case on today's docket is entitled "Malice Domestic." I
  hasten to add, however, that "Malice Domestic" is not about the
  servant problem, nor is it a puff for imported wines. It is
  concerned with some mysterious doings in a family of three: Carl
  Borden, his wife Annette, and their charming dog, Cassandra. To
  give you a clearer picture of exactly what happened, we now
  transport you to the scene of the crime where we shall reenact it.

[first lines]
Annette Borden: Oh, there you are, Lorna. Been looking all over for
  you.

[last lines]
Carl Borden: I took a big chance, baby, but it worked. The first time
  I wasn't too sick because I just took a small dose of arsenic. But
  that second time, oh, oh. That second time you almost lost me
  altogether. I tell you, I was as sick as a dog.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: You are all wondering, no doubt, how Carl Borden
  ended up in the jug. It is quite simple. His dog, Cassandra, was
  really a detective in disguise and turned him in at the next town.
  It's getting so a man can't even trust his best friend. This
  concludes this session of our little court of inhuman relations. I
  hope you will rejoin us when we next present a different case. Good
  night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Man from the South (#5.15)}
Carlos: [in a Las Vegas cocktail lounge, proposing the stakes of a
  bet] Well, I'm thinking of some small thing that you could afford
  to give away, and if you lose, why, you won't have to feel so bad -
  such as the little finger on your left hand.
Gambler: My what?
Carlos: Is that so strange? He wins - he takes the car. I win - I
  take his finger. Is that so strange?


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Martha Mason, Movie Star (#2.34)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. I've been on Mars where I went for
  the opening of a new television station. It's all part of a scheme
  to take the best of our cultural advances to the Martians. Or
  Martinis, as they prefer to be called. They are highly intelligent
  and my attempts to educate them were quite successful. Within a
  matter of minutes, they were able to spell out, "Earthman, go
  home," using my two companions to form the letters. It was very
  gratifying. As you have doubtless already guessed, tonight's play
  is entitled "Martha Mason, Movie Star."

[first lines]
Mabel McKay: Henry!
Henry McKay: Coming right up. Sorry, my dear. I'm afraid I overslept
  this morning. The lodge lasted till all hours. Reading of the
  treasurer's report. It was very interesting, though.

[last lines]
Police Detective: The boys saw how well those lilies were doing, so
  they dug them up to see why. And there was Henry... Hold her for
  murder.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Poor Mabel. I guess she just didn't have a green
  thumb. That concludes tonight's entertainment. Next time, we shall
  be back with another story. Meanwhile, I'm off to another planet.
  I've always been curious about Venus. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Momentum (#1.39)}
Alfred Hitchcock: It seems to me that television is exactly like a
  gun. Your enjoyment of it is determined by which end of it you're
  on.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Mr. Blanchard's Secret (#2.13)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [holding an umbrella] Good evening, friends. Would
  you all please examine the tops of your television sets and see if
  one of you doesn't find a goldfish bowl with a crack in it? [puts
  out his hand to test for rain] Thank you. By the way, I've been
  asked to announce that some of you are missing this program
  unnecessarily. You have moved and not kept us informed of your
  address. So we don't know where to send the show to you. I hope
  you'll take care of that matter at once. Tonight, we are presenting
  a tale of mystery and intrigue laid in middle-class suburbia. It is
  called "Mr. Blanchard's Secret." I realize this doesn't tell you
  much about the story, but several fine actors have been hired to do
  that, and I would hate to rob them of the privilege. And so,
  without further ado, we reveal Mr. Blanchard's secret.

[first lines]
Babs Fenton: [voice-over] Poor woman. It's a shame I had to kill her
  off that way. A psychiatrist would probably say that I had some
  hidden homicidal tendencies or something. Who knows? If I didn't
  get it off my chest by writing mystery stories, I might end up by
  committing a few murders myself. Phew! I'm glad it worked out this
  way, of course. It's so much healthier. Also, it pays better.
  Otherwise, I'd say that I was pretty normal. Even though my
  husband, John, doesn't always agree with me. It's my vivid
  imagination that gives John the most trouble. Poor John. He's a
  lawyer. Corporations mostly. Crime doesn't even enter his mind. But
  with me, it's like eating peanuts. Once I start thinking about it,
  I can't stop. Right now, I'm beginning to think some pretty strange
  things about the people next door. If I thought about it enough, I
  could really build it up into a production. Knowing myself, I
  probably will.

Babs Fenton: This looks like a set. Ready for the lady to enter on
  cue.

Babs Fenton: It doesn't work. They never do for me. I guess I just
  don't have a red thumb with lighters.

[last lines]
Mrs. Blanchard: It works now. I had Charles fix it. He's awfully good
  at that sort of thing. Although he hates to admit it.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: This concludes our show. Now, if you'll excuse me,
  I must hurry off to a little social affair. A dear friend is guest
  of honor. It's a stoning. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Good
  night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {My Brother, Richard (#2.17)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. I firmly believe that everyone should
  indulge now and then in some form of athletic sport, don't you?
  Personally, I don't require much exercise, since I lead a very
  Spartan existence. But when I do, I find my needs are adequately
  filled by such sports as riding or reading the less violent
  portions of the Sunday papers. Of course, for a true test of bodily
  coordination, I think there's nothing better than lying in a
  hammock, but I suppose that would only appeal to those of you who
  enjoy living dangerously. As for tonight's play, it is called, "My
  Brother, Richard" and it begins in a country club. By the way, golf
  is one game I've never cared much for. I don't like the paperwork.
  I find adding up my strokes too fatiguing.

[first lines]
Laura Ross: If you keep stuffing papers into that case, Martin, you
  won't have room for a clean shirt.

[last lines]
Martin Ross: Your boy is safe now, Mrs. Kopeck. We all are because of
  you. That'll be our defense. Yours and mine.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Thus ends "My Brother, Richard." Needless to say,
  Mrs. Grant was brought to trial, but fortunately, the jury took
  into account many of the circumstances which we saw reenacted
  tonight. On our next program, we shall present another story, and I
  will also be back to provide the marginalia. Until then, good
  night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Nightmare in 4-D (#2.16)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. Tonight's play is entitled,
  "Nightmare in 4-D." It will be presented in only two dimensions,
  however. We could present it in 3-D. In fact, we did in America,
  but the viewers kept getting involved and during one of the more
  violent scenes, we lost half our audience. We wouldn't want that to
  happen here. In this case, 4-D indicates the number of an
  apartment. And "Nightmare in 4-D" concerns the goings-on in that
  apartment. The goings-on will begin going on in just a moment.

[first lines]
Miss Elliott: [nearly dropping her packages] Oh, darn!
Harry Parker: Hold it! Hold it! I got it. All right. All right.

Harry Parker: Miss Elliot, I can't get involved in a murder. I'm a
  married man.

[last lines]
Lieutenant Orsatti: She was in the bedroom. Mrs. Bolton had her on
  the phone complaining about the TV being too loud. The murder was
  committed while they were talking. Any other ideas, Mr. Parker? I
  didn't think so. You can call your lawyer now if you like.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: That was amusing. Although I think Norma was a poor
  sport about it all. And now the time has come for us to part. But,
  please. No long goodbyes. Don't even look back. I want to remember
  you as you were. So, until next time, good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {None Are So Blind (#2.5)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [sitting in front of a mirror] Good evening. The
  entertainment industry is always crying for new faces. I've decided
  to give them one. Not that there's anything wrong with the old one.
  In fact, I think it's rather good.
[the mirror breaks]
Alfred Hitchcock: Well, it could have been worse. What if I had
  cracked?
[searching through wigs]
Alfred Hitchcock: See, here's the one.
[putting on a wig and glasses]
Alfred Hitchcock: I've always wanted to be someone else.
[looks at himself]
Alfred Hitchcock: That won't do. I look like a near-sighted hearth
  rug. By an odd coincidence, we have a story about a man who decided
  to be someone other than himself. And by an equally odd
  coincidence, it is rehearsed and ready to start. Here it is.

[first lines]
Seymour Johnston: [narrating] I suppose you could say it began that
  Easter Sunday. I was spending the weekend at my Aunt Muriel's house
  in Norwich, Connecticut. A place I was forced to spend many
  weekends. Not that I found my aunt's company particularly
  congenial, far from it. But the food was fair and even she didn't
  have the effrontery to charge me for my visits. Not that she wasn't
  capable of doing even that. As a matter of fact, nothing my aunt
  did would be too surprising. But that weekend, she went too far.
  Even for a person as good-natured as myself.

[last lines]
Police Detective: There's nothing dreadful about it. It's just a
  little difficult when you want to disguise yourself and you've
  managed to convince yourself that something isn't there. So you
  don't bother to disguise that. Particularly something as
  conspicuous as that birthmark of yours.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Poor Seymour. It couldn't have happened to a more
  deserving person. Um, I've decided not to be someone else after
  all. If I won't be myself, who will? However, allow me to indulge
  my exhibitionist tendencies with this quick-change demonstration.
  The Alfred Hitchcock of today.
[turns away from the camera, busies himself, then turns back
  unchanged]
Alfred Hitchcock: The Alfred Hitchcock of thirty years ago. The
  secret of this transformation is rather simple. I just removed my
  wallet. And now, I shall remove myself. But soon I shall return
  with another story. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Number Twenty-Two (#2.21)}
[introduction]
Narrator: This is a police lineup. Here desperate criminals who have
  been brought to bay appear before the detective force and are
  questioned by the chief detective. Listen.
Chief Detective: Take your hat off. Name: Hitchcock comma Alfred.
  Height: five foot six. Weight: prisoner refuses to make a
  statement. Here's his record. 1940, picked up on "Suspicion." 1942,
  "Spellbound." 1944, "Notorious." 1955, "Rear Window." 1956, "The
  Man Who Knew Too Much." Anything to say, Hitchcock?
Alfred Hitchcock: Well, sir, I admit it ain't a good record. But I'm
  trying to do better.
Chief Detective: Better? You call this latest charge "doing better"?
  Appearing on television!
Alfred Hitchcock: I'm sorry, sir. But my family was hungry.
Chief Detective: Now, take him away.
Alfred Hitchcock: Wait a minute, sir. You've got the wrong man. Don't
  you want to see a sample of me work?
Chief Detective: Okay, here's what we found on him when we picked him
  up.

[first lines]
Kelly: Hold it, kid!

[last lines]
Skinner #21: You picked a good one for your first time, didn't you,
  kid?
Chief of Detectives: [off-screen] Number 17, take the circle, please.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Occasionally, in our series, we touch on a subject
  that is far too real to be made the butt of my usual flippant
  remarks. Tonight's story of juvenile delinquency is certainly a
  case in point. And we have presented it with a hope that it might,
  in some small way, throw a little light on what has become a
  serious national problem.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {On the Nose (#3.20)}
Himself - Host: [reading the scale he's standing on] Will one of you,
  please, get off?

Himself - Host: I've decided to give up being a jockey. The horses
  all went in and bought me an automobile.

Mr. Cooney: How much do you have?
Fran Holland: About a dollar or so.
Mr. Cooney: Give it to me. [she hands over her purse] One dollar...
  [picks the coins]
Fran Holland: Hey you're leaving me without a cent!
Mr. Cooney: Oh now I wouldn't do that. 15 cents, you can keep that
  for el and bus fare.

Fran Holland: 15 cents, bus fare! [thinking] Why not? It could work.

Fran Holland: [paying her debt] A 20 dollar bill, and five dollars in
  change. I think you'll find, Mr. Cooney that there's about 15 cents
  extra in there, you can keep that for el and bus fare.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {One More Mile to Go (#2.28)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. Most of you have doubtless read how
  Anne Boleyn lost her head. King Henry VIII, no longer fascinated,
  said, "Let her be decapitated." Thereupon the legend goes, her
  ghost roamed about each night with utmost dignity and charm, with
  her head tucked underneath her arm. [camera pulls back to reveal
  Hitchcock holding his own extra head] Now with two heads it occurs
  to me, I can think more clearly than with three. However, if the
  worst should come, one head's a basic minimum. Therefore, in my
  work, I hardly dare to roam about without one spare. Tonight's
  legend tells of modern life and how to solve a problem: wife.

[first lines]
Sam Jacoby: I was only doing 35, officer.
Motorcycle Cop: What I stopped you for has got nothing to do with
  speeding.

[last lines]
Motorcycle Cop: No, that's pretty dangerous. You better have it fixed
  now. Follow me.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Thank you. One less mile to go. Next week another
  script, another show. When electrons glide across your screen,
  bringing some new and unforeseen brand of murder. I mean the quiet
  kind, perpetrated solely in our mind. A gentle thump. A soothing
  splash. No bullet, shriek or livid gash. No stains, no fumes, no
  ugly splatter. We use only the purest subject matter. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {One for the Road (#2.23)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [locked in the stockades] Good evening. Methinks I
  should never have come to the colonies. Here I am, the producer's
  dream, a captive audience. Unfortunately, knowing the producer, I
  have already seen tonight's story several times. It is called, "One
  for the Road." They say there are two sides to every question, but
  tonight's little problem has three sides. For it is that age old
  bit of marital geometry, the eternal triangle.

[first lines]
Charles Hendricks: Marsha?
Marsha Hendricks: I'm coming, darling.
Charles Hendricks: Where are my cigarettes?

[last lines]
Charles Hendricks: Why not? One for the road.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: It's good to be free again, which is more than
  Beryl Abbott is. You see, she was arrested and paid for her crime.
  Next time we shall be back with another story. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Relative Value (#4.21)}
[first lines]
Felix Edward Manbridge: [holding a 50-pound forged check] A hundred
  pounds? It's out of the question! And I'm astonished at your having
  the nerve to ask for it - on top of this! John, don't you realize
  that your signing my name to a check is forgery?
John Manbridge: You needn't blame me for that! I wouldn't have done
  it, if I had any alternative!


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Revenge (#1.1)}
Elsa Span: [delirious] He killed me... he killed me...

Himself - Host: You see: crime does not pay. Not even on television.
  You must have a sponsor. Here is ours, after which I'll return.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Safety for the Witness (#4.8)}
Hospital Cashier: [Referring to Jones] That's a nice mam, a nice
  little man, I bet you 8 to 5 he doesn't last to Tuesday.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Shopping for Death (#1.18)}
Himself - Host: You needn't sit there staring. We're not going to
  show you anymore. In fact, I'm not even going to tell you what
  happened. Television audiences are becoming entirely too dependent.
  You expect us to do everything for you. [he holds up his hands and
  flexes his fingers; they squeak and creak loudly, as the door did]
  This oil is terribly difficult to get rid of. Look, while I'm
  working on this, please listen closely to the following and do
  exactly what they tell you.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Better Bargain (#2.11)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [carrying a cello case] Good evening, ladies and
  gentlemen. A special word to those of you who have been arrested
  while speeding home to see this show. I can do nothing to bail you
  out. And I'm afraid the magistrate is only slightly in my debt. I
  shall, however, do everything I can to make you forget your
  troubles. Tonight's narrative is about gangsters. And I thought I'd
  best test some of the props. [takes out a machine gun and shoots
  it; it makes the sounds of piano keys] I would like to play "The
  Flight of the Bumblebee." But we must get on with the show.

[first lines]
Baldy: King?
Louis Koster: Yes?
Baldy: Cutter's here again.

Harry Silver: I'd hate to take something as warm as that and turn her
  into something cold and dead.

[last lines]
Harry Silver: Good. Now I think I'll kill you.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: To summarize the next reel, Harry did as he
  threatened, and Marian lives happily ever after. She had a rich,
  full life. It was too bad Harry was not there to share it with her,
  but of course, crime does not pay, murder will out, etcetera,
  etcetera. And now, good night until we again bring you a saga of
  suspense and/or mystery. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Cheney Vase (#1.13)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [holding a voodoo doll and a hypodermic needle] Oh,
  oh, good evening. I was just about to send greetings to an old
  friend. I'm sure modern, civilized methods of homicide are much
  more efficient. But I don't care for them. I abhor violence. That
  is why on this program we use stabbings, shootings and garrotings
  only when they are absolutely essential to the plot. Or when the
  whim strikes us. Tonight's play begins in a museum. And the title
  is "The Cheney Vase." That's all I intend to tell you. You'll have
  to figure the rest out for yourselves. And now our sponsor wishes
  to say a few words designed to send you rushing out immediately to
  buy his products. But please endeavor to restrain yourselves. I
  don't want you to miss our story.

[first lines]
Homer Koether: I don't intend to discuss it any further. I want you
  to leave the museum this afternoon.

[last lines]
Martha Cheney: I wouldn't do that Mr. Endicott. That one might be the
  original. And I wouldn't try to make me tell you which one it is.
  I'm a poor, deluded old woman. Probably mad, you know. I wouldn't
  be able to tell one from the other. You know they're really rather
  good, those copies. I'd probably be able to sell them for a great
  deal of money.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: And so another American primitive was born.
  Thinking our audience might be interested in obtaining a memento of
  tonight's story, we asked, uh, Grandma Cheney to whip up a few
  thousand more vases. And we're prepared to make an amazing offer on
  a strictly first-come-first-serve basis. Listen closely. This will
  not be repeated. If you wish one of these lovely vases, just send
  us your name and address together with $45,000 in cash. Please do
  not send stamps or coins. And now our sponsor wishes to tell you of
  an equally amazing opportunity for your benefit. After which I'll
  be back. [after commercial] My, they did go fast, didn't they? Next
  week, we shall return... [accidentally knocks over the one vase
  that's left] Please don't be alarmed. [he picks up the vase, which
  is unharmed] Next week we shall return with another story. Good
  night.

Lyle Endicott: Mr. Koether, the work I did here as your assistant
  could have been done by a reasonably intelligent child. Leaving
  won't be exactly a hardship. However, you're rather conveniently
  forgetting my severance pay.
Homer Koether: If you want to make an issue of the money, Lyle, I'll
  be glad to take it up with the board. I'm prepared to go completely
  over your record for the three months you've been here. Your
  inability to arrive even approximately on time, the four days off
  last month with no reason whatsoever...
Lyle Endicott: It was spring, Mr. Koether, though I doubt whether you
  were aware of that.
Homer Koether: I want you out of this building by three o'clock.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Cream of the Jest (#2.24)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [in a library] Good evening. I understand it is
  fashionable to introduce television plays from a library. And so, I
  thought I would preface tonight's play, "The Cream of the Jest" in
  this way. [camera pulls back to reveal that he's in a public
  library with other patrons] "The Cream of the Jest" is a play about
  the theatrical business. [patrons shush him; he continues,
  whispering] And it has as its central character a fading actor
  named Charles Hanover Gresham. Our play will... [patrons shush him
  again; he continues quickly] Our play begins in just one moment!

[first lines]
Jerry the Bartender: [to a customer] Thank you.
Charles Gresham: Hello, Jerry. How fresh and dewy you look.

Charles Gresham: I'm dead when I'm not doing a job of acting. You
  know, sometimes when I'm in my room, I go to the mirror, and I... I
  look into it, trying to see who I am, who the "me" is. I talk to
  myself. And all the characters I've ever played pass in front of
  me. And I'm every one of them, but that's all I am. There's no real
  me, only the characters. Don't you see? Then I... then I go back
  and I sit and I wait. I wait for somebody, somebody like you,
  Wayne, to call me, to bring me back to life again. I'm only real
  when I'm acting. The rest of the time I'm nothing. That's why I
  drink. Don't you see?

[last lines]
Mr. Roper: [reading] "From the office of Wayne Campbell. Listen pal,
  you can't shove me off. I know too much." Wayne Campbell.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Well, there's no use taking that book home with us
  now we've finished it. By the way, in case you are interested, the
  police learned of Wayne Campbell's connection with tonight's
  crime... I can't understand why this coat doesn't seem to fit. I
  just bought it. There seems to be a message stitched inside.
  "Occupancy by more than one person contrary to law." Well, no
  wonder. Next time, we shall return with another story. Join us
  then. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Creeper (#1.38)}
Ed: I'm working on a theory... only thing those two victims had in
  common was that they were alone at night, and they were both
  blonde. [looks at Steve] What's the matter, Steve?
Steve Grant: I was just thinking... Ellen's all alone, and she's
  blonde.

Ed: I've wanted to do that for a long time and now that I have, I
  wish I hadn't.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Dangerous People (#2.39)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. You will excuse me if I speak
  rapidly, but I haven't much time. I'm playing some idiotic
  children's game, and I'm supposed to stand against this wall,
  blindfolded, and with my hands tied behind me. While I'm standing
  here waiting for something to happen, you may watch tonight's
  drama, "The Dangerous People." I shall join you later. [a machine
  gun fires bullets in a straight line across the wall] Thank you,
  but no more applause.

[first lines]
Bellefontaine: Oh, hello.
Jones: Hello.
Bellefontaine: [voice-over] It was foolish to hurry so. What's the
  matter with me? Now I'm out of breath. I'll stay here a minute to
  get my breath, or else he'll ask what's the matter, and I'll tell
  him it's asthma, and he'll tell me about how his wife had asthma,
  or his boss, or his cousin Wilbur.

[last lines]
Maniac: I wanna go back where it's safer.
Man in White Coat: That's where we're going.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: [rubbing his stomach] That's all for this evening.
  I think we shall be back another time with another story. Until
  then, good night. [walks away from the wall, revealing bullet holes
  directly behind where he stood]


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The End of Indian Summer (#2.22)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [fishing in a bathtub] Shh! I can't understand it.
  Of course. How stupid of me. I forgot to put in the water. I must
  do that at once if I want to catch anything today. All of this is
  not as absurdly irrelevant as you think. For if you listen very
  closely, you will hear the words "bath tub" mentioned in tonight's
  script. Of course, other topics are mentioned which we could have
  discussed. For example, the story is about marriage. However, I
  don't feel that marriage should be discussed on television. It's
  too controversial. No question about it. We are much safer with a
  bathtub. And now, in a moment, here is tonight's opéra bouffe, "The
  End of Indian Summer." Like all stories about marriage it has a
  great deal of romance in it. But watch for that bathtub.

[first lines]
Henderson: [on the phone] All right, all right. You don't have to
  shout. There's nothing wrong with my ears. Anyone can make a
  mistake. No, I am not gonna fire him. Not yet.

[last lines]
Joe Rogers: Well, I suppose it all depends now on whether she takes
  her bath before he eats breakfast.
Saunders: Or vice versa.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: There's was truly a wedding of December and
  December. It ended in a draw, with no one the winner except the
  insurance companies. And now for the epilogue of tonight's story,
  after which I'll scamper back. [after commercial] We have now
  passed another tombstone along television's highway to culture.
  Please join us next week when we continue our pilgrimage.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Greatest Monster of Them All (#6.18)}
Morty Lenton: Oh - Freddie, boy. We just been dropping your name.
Fred Logan: [laughs dryly] How clumsy.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Hidden Thing (#1.34)}
Alfred Hitchcock: [holding a gun] This is for the man who has
  everything. It's to enable you to take some of it away from him.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Indestructible Mr. Weems (#2.37)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [lying down] Good evening. Since you're allowed to
  make yourselves comfortable during our show, I thought it only
  right that I be allowed to relax. After all, the rules of
  television seem weighed far too much in favor of the viewer. You
  can relax in your home, while I must stay here in this drafty
  studio. I'm not feeling a bit well. But the show must go on,
  whether you like it or not. And tonight's show is called "The
  Indestructible Mr. Weems."

[first lines]
Harry Brown: Have any luck?
Mr. Brodheit: Hmm? Oh, not bad, shot a 41 on the front nine, then a
  birdie three on...

[last lines]
Clarence Weems: It was the least I could do. He tried dreadful hard
  to make a success of this place.
Minister: [off-screen] Relatives and good friends of Cato Stone...

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: There. I think that proves that we can be as
  sunshiny as anyone. Clarence and the widow Collins lived happily
  ever after. And in desperation, the trustees finally converted
  their park into a track for dog racing. It proved more popular than
  a cemetery, and rather profitable, too. [walks over to a coffin]
  One of the consolations of being ill is the gifts one receives. One
  of my dear friends sent me this. Solid oak. Silver handles, too.
  Apparently, the donor wishes to remain anonymous. The card is
  unsigned. [holds up the card; it reads "Wear it in good health"]
  Very nice. But I better not overtax myself. Until our next visiting
  hours, then. [lies down and holds up a sign that says, "Do Not
  Disturb"]


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Manacled (#2.18)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and television
  fans all over, uh, the living room floor. Tonight's drama is called
  "The Manacles" and features a pair of these attractive and useful
  charm bracelets. These, of course, are stage handcuffs especially
  made so that one can easily get out. Of course, as you may know,
  these little trinkets are not only used to cuff hands, they work
  very well on legs. Regardez. [handcuffs himself to a table;
  struggles] While I'm getting out of this, perhaps we better begin
  our play. Ladies and gentlemen, "The Manacled."

[first lines]
Train Station Announcer: [off screen] Announcing the departure of
  northbound train 146 for Bakersfield, Tulare, Fresno, Merced,
  Martinez, Richmond, Berkley and Oakland. Now boarding on track
  number three.

Sgt. Rockwell: You had it figured, huh?
Stephen Fontaine: Well, not exactly. I didn't know who the lucky man
  would be. I thought whoever it was would be wearing a ready-made
  suit off of a basement rack, his heels would be run down. Be the
  kind of man who was living on the installment plan. Doesn't really
  own anything, just pieces of things. A piece of a cheap car, a
  piece of an ice box, a piece of a bedroom set. And all the stuff he
  has pieces of is already falling to pieces. But he'll keep paying
  on it and paying on it, month after month because that's the kind
  of man he is. Just a piece of a man.

[last lines]
Stephen Fontaine: The bullet.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: [lifts the table and removes the cuff from the
  bottom of the leg] At least I can get home now. I hope to have my
  hand free next time you see me. If I do, we should be able to
  present another story. Why not tune in and see? Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Older Sister (#1.17)}
Himself - Host: [Hitchcock stands there holding an ax] This is an ax.
  I say this for the convenience of those of you whose television
  tubes may have burned out. I wish to reach the largest possible
  audience.

Himself - Host: Did she seem a trifle overwrought to you? She did to
  me. But then I react in precisely the same way whenever I hear a
  child singing Davy Crockett. Being more civilized than Lizzie, I
  don't go about hitting tables. I hit the child instead, not with
  the ax of course but in a nice way.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Rose Garden (#2.12)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [digging in a cemetery lot next to a sign that says
  "Come in and browse"] Oh, good evening, friends, Romans and
  countrymen. I've just unearthed some items which may be of vast
  archaeological importance. Two fig leaves. And a half-eaten apple.
  Tonight's play is not about fig leaves, but it does have a scene in
  a garden. It is called "The Rose Garden." And it's concerned with
  two elderly sisters in a magnolia-scented house in Louisiana.

[first lines]
Cab Driver Barney: You say you come all the way to New York to see
  Miss Julia on business? You sure you ain't got them mixed up? You
  didn't come to see Miss Cordelia?
Alexander Vinton: No, who is Miss Cordelia?

Julia Pickering: Sister, I just thought I wouldn't go for once. It's
  Mr. Vinton's last night.
Mrs. Cordelia Welles: Nonsense. The choir's down to nothing these
  last few weeks. Reverend Samuels is counting on you. I'm sure Mr.
  Vinton doesn't consider himself more important than God.
Alexander Vinton: Oh, no, not at all.

Mrs. Cordelia Welles: No member of our family has been north for 100
  years.
Alexander Vinton: It's changed a good deal, I believe.

Mrs. Cordelia Welles: You were looking for my husband's body, is that
  right?
Alexander Vinton: Yes, I'm afraid I was.
Mrs. Cordelia Welles: Perhaps you would like to dig a little deeper.
Alexander Vinton: Oh, no. Thank you.

[last lines]
Julia Pickering: You know, I've known all about this for two years.
  They'll probably send me to prison, too. Maybe I could write it
  there.
Alexander Vinton: I'm sure they won't. But if they do, I shall insist
  they don't give you time off for good behavior.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: So much for the literary set. And now we must
  interrupt our program while we prepare the next play for
  production. I shall see you then. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The Sorcerer's Apprentice (#7.39)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. I'm looking to see what lies ahead.
  The old Romans used to tell the future by cutting animals open and
  examining their entrails. Due to some objections by
  anti-vivisectionists, we have to omit the butchery. But through the
  wonders of modern science, we are not denied a glimpse into the
  future. Besides, it's much more tidy this way. This is an x-ray of
  a goat, an animal which the ancients found to be full of strange
  portents. Hm, it looks like rain. I can see this will also give one
  insight about the past. For example, I now know what happened to
  those car keys I lost last summer. As to the immediate future,
  either this x-ray plate wasn't properly developed, or else we are
  in for a very dismal time of it for the next minute.

[first lines]
Sadini: Hey, wake up. This is no place to sleep. Come on, wake up.
  You'll freeze to death.

[last lines]
Hugo: Smile, Irene! Smile! Smile!

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: I don't know quite how to put this. However, I must
  tell you the truth. The saw worked excellently, but the wand
  didn't. Hugo was terribly upset. And Irene was beside herself. As
  for the police, they misunderstood the whole thing and arrested
  Hugo for murder. There's not much more to say, but I shall say it
  after the following commercial break. [after commercial] The
  forgoing has made it obvious to me that we've had quite enough for
  one evening. We shall save the rest for next week when I shall
  reappear. Until then, good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {The West Warlock Time Capsule (#2.35)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening, television watchers. Tonight's masque
  is entitled, "The West Warlock Time Capsule": the tale of a timid
  taxidermist. This gives me the excuse to exhibit this prize of mine
  and to discuss taxidermy. I feel I know quite a bit about stuffed
  animals. After all, it takes one to know one. This, I shot myself.
  You see, deer poaching is one of my hobbies. It took only two
  shots. The first one hit a bearded old man wearing a ridiculous red
  suit and riding in a sleigh. I'm having him stuffed, too. It
  probably sounds silly to you, but I'm sentimental that way. But
  enough of this. Here, in a moment, is "The West Warlock Time
  Capsule."

[first lines]
Customer: Well, I know Harry's gonna like it, George. And when some
  of his friends gets a look at this, I bet you get their business,
  too. If they ever hunt up this way.

[last lines]
Mayor: Well, George, it certainly ought to put West Warlock in the
  national limelight when they look inside Napoleon in the year 2057.
  What do you think?
George Tiffany: Well, yes, I--I expect it it'll do that, all right.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: Honesty demands that I reveal that all did not go
  as Mr. Tiffany had planned. The weight of Waldren's pudgy body
  proved too much for Napoleon and within a few months the time
  capsule was opened by a caesarian section. Waldren, of course, was
  quite dead. And Napoleon hasn't been the same since. As for Mr.
  Tiffany, the jury proved quite lenient. Next time we plan a return
  trip to your living rooms. I hope you will join us then. Good
  night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {There Was an Old Woman (#1.25)}
Alfred Hitchcock: Good evening. I have a request for those of you who
  are not watching television: Please turn on your set. I'm sure I
  look much worse in the flamboyant Technicolor of your imagination
  than I do in the austere black and white of television.

Frank Bramwell: [threatening Miss Laughton with a knife] Do you dig
  up that money right now, or do I use this on you?
Monica Laughton: I haven't quite decided.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Toby (#2.6)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [Hitchcock looks down as steam rises] "Double,
  double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble."
[the camera pulls back to reveal he's heating a baby bottle]
Alfred Hitchcock: I don't know why people do this.
[he pours a few drops on his wrist]
Alfred Hitchcock: It's not at all good for the cuffs. Takes the
  starch out of them. I wonder if it does that to babies? Of course,
  that must be the idea. As you shall soon see, tonight's play bears
  a relation to the foregoing, however slight. It is a tragical,
  comical, historical, pastoral, musical mystery entitled "Toby."
  "Toby" takes place in New York in 1910. And on your television
  screen in just a moment.

[first lines]
Mrs. Foster: So, well, then he says he wants new dishes in the
  cupboards. "New dishes," I says. "Mr. Birch, look, I don't put new
  dishes in my furnished flats." But no, he insists, "She's got to
  have new dishes when she moves in."

[last lines]
Albert Birch: Toby. Edwina.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: "When shall we three meet again? In thunder,
  lightning or in rain? When the hurly-burly's done, when the
  battle's lost and won? Well, that will be ere the set of sun."
  Well, in other words, next week. Good night, coz.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Vicious Circle (#2.29)}
Betty: When I met you, you were clean. Now... now you're dirty.
Manny Coe: I don't have to take that kind of junk.
Betty: Where are you going, to your dear Mr. Williams?
Manny Coe: What have you got against Mr. Williams?
Betty: I hate him!

Manny Coe: Mr. Williams has everything I want. He can help me get
  things. He likes me.
Betty: Sure he likes you, as long as you're useful with a trigger and
  you smile real pretty.
Manny Coe: You're jealous of Mr. Williams!

Betty: You quit Mr. Williams, or we're finished.

Turk: You know, when you first came into this neighborhood, I was top
  boy with Mr. Williams. I was 24. How old are you? How did you ease
  me out?
Manny Coe: Charm, man. Charm.

Vincent Williams: I asked you here tonight to talk about you, Manny.
  You please me very much. And when one of my boys pleases me, he's
  always rewarded.

Vincent Williams: It's a pity there are so many strange people in the
  world. I really don't understand them.
Manny Coe: There's nothing wrong with Betty.
Vincent Williams: Didn't you know? I'm afraid Betty doesn't like me.
  She even says I'm a crook. There's a rumor she's starting a purity
  campaign against our kind of people.

Vincent Williams: People with rash ideas must be put away for their
  own good.
Manny Coe: I don't get it.
Vincent Williams: Really, Manny. Come now, you're not that naïve.
Manny Coe: But she loves me, Mr. Williams.
Vincent Williams: That's the beauty of it. To triumph over that
  little impediment of love. And after it's done, Manny, think of the
  elation. Free from emotional annoyances.

Vincent Williams: I'm afraid your Betty is the kind of woman who
  would wait 20 years for you to get out of prison, moral and
  repentant.
Manny Coe: I just can't believe she'd tell on me.
Vincent Williams: I assure you, she did. Always beware the woman who
  loves you. Most often, they want to run your life. And I think that
  if anyone was to run your life, I'd be better qualified.

Vincent Williams: Yes, there's the technical difficulty. This is no
  ordinary job. It has to be done expertly. It's some time since I
  was a technician, but the talent hasn't left me. Let's see. I have
  it. New Year's Eve is just a few days off.
Manny Coe: New Year's Eve?
Vincent Williams: The noise, the confusion, the gaiety at the end of
  an old year and the start of a new. The end of an old life, and the
  start of a new one. [He lies down on the sofa] Your new life. Until
  the new year. Good-bye, Manny. [He holds out his hand. Manny shakes
  his hand briefly, but Vincent continues to hold Manny's hand until
  Manny pulls away]

Vincent Williams: A very impressive funeral. I don't quite know why,
  but I always feel more alive when someone else has died.
Manny Coe: I know what you mean.
Vincent Williams: Of course you do, Manny. You've proven it to me,
  time and again. But this last job - Betty - ah, that was a real
  masterpiece. You rose decidedly in my estimation. Getting her to
  run in front of a car. Very clever. No bullet wounds, no suspicion.
  Completely clean. Commendable.
Manny Coe: Thank you, Mr. Williams.
Vincent Williams: From now on, it might be "Vincent." Don't you
  think?
Manny Coe: Yeah. Vincent!
Vincent Williams: [Vincent lifts his glass] To Manny Coe, new
  assistant in Vincent Williams Enterprises.
Manny Coe: I'll drink to that. To the future, Vincent. To the future.

Vincent Williams: Hello, Georgie.
Georgie: Hello, Mr. Williams.
Vincent Williams: Having a good time?
Georgie: Swell. Thanks for inviting me. I didn't have anything decent
  to wear...
Vincent Williams: Well, we'll have to see to it that you get some new
  clothes. Won't we?
Georgie: Yes, Mr. Williams. Boy, it's sure funny, isn't it? If I had
  clothes and dough and a car like Mr. Coe, I'd be enjoying myself,
  having a swell time.
Vincent Williams: [Vincent looks over to the bar, where he sees
  Manny. Manny is talking with a woman, who has her arms around him]
  You're a very observant boy, Georgie. By the way, I thought you
  handled that camera store job very intelligently.
Georgie: Yes, Mr. Williams.
Vincent Williams: [Vincent puts his hand on Georgie's shoulder] I
  think a gray herringbone tweed would look very nice on you.
  [Vincent walks away. Georgie smiles triumphantly]

Vincent Williams: What's the matter, Manny?
Manny Coe: Nothing, Vincent.
Vincent Williams: Why are you leaving?
Manny Coe: [Surprised] What?
Vincent Williams: [Vincent takes him by the arm and leads him toward
  the door] Oh, Manny. I'm sorry the Johnson job didn't turn out to
  be the success we anticipated.
Manny Coe: I can't understand what happened. I planned every detail.
  I thought I hadn't overlooked anything.
Vincent Williams: Perhaps you need a vacation.
Manny Coe: Oh no. No, I'm sure I'll be all right by tomorrow night.
Vincent Williams: Get a good night's sleep.
Manny Coe: Thank you, Vincent. Good night. [He walks toward the door,
  where he sees Georgie]
Georgie: Leaving, Mr. Coe? [Georgie grins]
Manny Coe: [Looking disgusted] Yeah.

Manny Coe: I've got to be up early tomorrow morning. It's a
  conference with Mr. Williams. You know how it is.

Georgie: [Georgie points a gun at Manny] Hello, Manny. Mr. Williams
  sent me.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Wet Saturday (#2.1)}
[introduction]
Alfred Hitchcock: [lying on a shelf with a tea set] Oh, good evening.
  I'm so glad you found me. As you can see, our, uh, new quarters are
  rather modest, but we like the location. And thought the change
  might do us good, also. And now, if you don't mind, I would like to
  indulge in an old American custom. No matter how busy they are or
  what the surroundings may be, Americans never omit this quaint
  ritual. If you don't care to join me, I think you'll find our play
  is about to begin on one of the lower shelves.

[first lines]
Mr. Princey: Be quiet. They'd send her to an institution or they'd
  hang her. We should have to move away from here. It would be
  impossible.

[last lines]
Mr. Princey: Well, I-- I believe that should cover everything. I hope
  you let this be an example to you, my boy. It's a rare problem that
  won't yield to a little thought and patience. But we must be very
  careful never to leave any loose ends dangling. You see, that's the
  thing. A little tea, Mother, please.

[afterword]
Alfred Hitchcock: I presume that story was intended to illustrate
  that blood is thicker than water. I always find it heartwarming to
  see a family standing shoulder to shoulder in the face of
  adversity. Unfortunately, the authorities were not thrilled by this
  sight, and were seen tossing about such phrases as, "obstructing
  justice," "accessory after the fact," "murder in the first degree."
  Very nasty. The Princeys received substantial sentences. You see,
  unfortunately, Captain Smollet didn't play the game. When the
  police arrived he insisted on his innocence, thus confusing poor
  Millicent to such an extent that she re-enacted the crime with her
  father as the victim. Broke the croquet mallet, too. I believe I'll
  have another.
[pours from the teapot, then picks up the milk pitcher]
Alfred Hitchcock: There's no more vermouth. Oh, well. Fortunately, I
  still have plenty of olives.
[drinks]
Alfred Hitchcock: That was exceedingly dry. Next week, we shall be
  back at the same old stand. Please drop in again. Good night.


# "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (1955) {Whodunit (#1.26)}
Himself - Host: Good evening, fellow necromaniacs. I'm glad so many
  of you could come. I should explain that the word has nothing to do
  with necking. I'm awfully sorry. I haven't time to explain it now.

[first lines for first season's episodes]
[narrator speaks over scenes of Heyes and Curry committing various
  robberies]
Narrator: Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry - the two most successful
  outlaws in the history of the West. And in all the trains and banks
  they robbed, they never shot anyone. This made our two latter-day
  Robin Hoods very popular - with everyone but the railroads and the
  banks.
[cut to scene of posse in hot pursuit of Heyes and Curry]
Jed 'Kid' Curry: There's one we thing we gotta get, Heyes.
Hannibal Heyes: What's that?
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Out of this business!
[cut to meeting between Heyes, Curry and Sheriff Trevors]
Sheriff Lom Trevors: The governor can't come flat out and give you
  amnesty now. First you have to prove you deserve it.
Hannibal Heyes: Ah. So all we have to do is just stay out of trouble
  till the governor figures we deserve amnesty.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: But in the mean time, we'll still be wanted.
Sheriff Lom Trevors: Well, that's true. Till then only you, me and
  the Governor will know about it. It'll be our little secret.
Hannibal Heyes: That's a good deal? [cut to scene where another posse
  is in hot pursuit of Heyes and Curry]
Jed 'Kid' Curry: I sure wish the governor'd let a few more people in
  on our secret!

Jed 'Kid' Curry: Heyes, there's only one thing been keepin' you alive
  all this time.
Hannibal Heyes: And what's that?
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Me.

[while Curry buys stagecoach tickets, Heyes scribbles the text of a
  telegram to Sheriff Trevors]
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Let me see that.
Hannibal Heyes: You can't read my writing!
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Can you?

Hannibal Heyes: Curiosity is a vice. It's one of the few I don't
  have.

Hannibal Heyes: What are you sweatin' for, Kid? I've handled
  nitroglycerin before.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: I know, Heyes, but there's always a last time.

Hannibal Heyes: Look, Wheat, I agree, we gotta bust him out. But it's
  gonna take finesse.
Kyle Murtry: Wheat didn't bring any of that.

Telegraph clerk: Any reply?
Hannibal Heyes: Yeah, but you wouldn't send it.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {21 Days to Tenstrike (#2.15)}
Gantry: You two robbed banks? Why?
Hannibal Heyes: That's where the money was kept.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {A Fistful of Diamonds (#1.8)}
August Binford: Who are you?
Hannibal Heyes: Mr. Binford, don't you recognize your own
  descriptions? I'm Hannibal Heyes and he's Kid Curry.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: And we don't rob banks any more.
Hannibal Heyes: And when we were robbing banks, we didn't kill
  people. Now you've put us into terrible trouble, Mr. Binford. We
  were doing our best to get an amnesty and you tore it all apart.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: And we wanted that amnesty real bad.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Alias Smith and Jones (#1.1)}
[opening narration]
narrator (opening sequence only): Into the West came many men. Some
  were good men and some were bad men. Some were good men with some
  bad in them and some were bad men with some good in them. This is
  the story of two pretty good bad men. Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry.
  Together these gentlemen substantially altered the course of
  America's frontier. They did a lot to change railroad schedules,
  too. And in all the trains and banks they robbed, they never shot
  anyone. This made our two latter-day Robin Hoods very popular...
  with everyone but the railroads and the banks. Because unlike Robin
  Hood, Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry robbed from the rich and kept
  the money for themselves. It was a good life. But times were
  changing. Safes were getting better. Posses were getting bigger.
  Sheriffs were getting smarter. And modern communications made it
  only a matter of time 'til they would be captured, and maybe even
  killed.

Narrator: Nobody can really pinpoint just when that period called the
  West ended. Maybe it was when the last outlaws were captured or put
  out of business. If so, this story is about the end of the West.
  This was American's frontier at the turn of the century... indoor
  plumbing and telephones, automobiles and nickelodeons. The West was
  getting to be downright comfortable for everyone. Well, everyone
  but the outlaws.

Jed Kid Curry - Thaddeus Jones: Well, you know what we got here, Mr.
  Smith? We got ourselves a walk-off.
Hannibal Heyes - Joshua Smith: Don't get started.
Kane: Walk-off? I don't like that, mister. I don't even know what it
  means.
Jed Kid Curry - Thaddeus Jones: Well, then, I'm gonna tell ya. You
  see, when the good Lord was makin' men, He got a whole bunch of 'em
  all whomped up together and then He decided to knock off for the
  rest of the day, thinkin' He'd put the brains in later. But guess
  what happened? A whole bunch of them critters just upped and walked
  off 'fore he ever got back. And that's what we've got here.
  Walk-off.

Narrator: The days of the outlaw were numbered. But they hadn't given
  up yet.

Hannibal Heyes - Joshua Smith: What do you know about this? [hands
  over amnesty poster]
Sheriff Lom Trevors: Amnesty? It's a program the governor's trying
  out to see if... [laughs] You ain't thinking of amnesty for you
  two? That's for cheap crooks and grifters!
Hannibal Heyes - Joshua Smith: Can we help it if we're a bit better
  at what we do?
Jed Kid Curry - Thaddeus Jones: You can't tell me the governor's
  gonna penalize us for excellence!

[last lines]
Narrator: So for the following year, the West's most wanted men would
  lead model lives - lives of temperance, moderation and tranquility.
  Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry would cease to exist. In their places
  would ride two men of peace... alias Smith and Jones.

Hannibal Heyes - Joshua Smith: Don't get proddy, Wheat.

Kyle: Ain't you nervous, Wheat?
Wheat: H'uh?
Kyle: Well, you never done first bandit before.

Wheat: Don't move and don't holler, 'cause this is a stick-up. [sees
  Heyes] What are you doing back there?
Hannibal Heyes - Joshua Smith: One thing I ain't doin' is gettin'
  robbed!

Deputy Harker: And in this town, you boys is knowed as transients.
Wheat: Transients...
Kyle: Sounds like a hanging offense if I ever heard one.

Sheriff Lom Trevors: [last lines, which became theme lines for show]
  You've been granted provisional amnesty. 'Course the governor can't
  come flat out and give you amnesty now without letting himself in
  for a lot of criticism. So first you got to prove you deserve it.
  'Til then, only you, me, and the governor will know about it. It'll
  be our secret.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Secret?
Hannibal Heyes: For how long?
Sheriff Lom Trevors: Well, the governor figures a year. He figures if
  you can stay out of trouble for twelve months, you can do it
  forever. Then you got it! The whole thing - fresh start, clean bill
  of health. Amnesty!
Hannibal Heyes: So all we got to do is just stay out of trouble for
  one year?
Jed 'Kid' Curry: But we'll still be wanted. We'll still be blamed for
  everything that goes wrong!
Hannibal Heyes: We'll still be the same men we was before you talked
  to the governor!
Sheriff Lom Trevors: Well, that's true. But it's only for twelve
  months. You can do it, boys, I'm sure you can! Just like you stayed
  out of trouble for the last few days right here in Porterville.
  Now, that wasn't so hard, really, was it?


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Bad Night in Big Butte (#2.23)}
First Sheriff: Skeet Jenkins? Yeah, he lived here for a spell.
Boot Coby: Just how long is a spell, Sheriff?
First Sheriff: Well, his lasted about two months.
Boot Coby: You mean he's gone.
First Sheriff: Yup.
Boot Coby: Any idea where he went?
First Sheriff: Ah, down the road about a mile and a half.
Boot Coby: What's down the road about a mile and a half?
First Sheriff: The cemetery.

Boot Coby: Jenkins is dead?
First Sheriff: Well, he hasn't admitted it, but you can't believe a
  word them old outlaws say.

[observing a beautiful woman at a funeral]
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Nooo, that can't be George.
Hannibal Heyes: Well, why not? Her father spent some hard years bein'
  in prison and all.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Yeah, but his name wasn't Jenkins.
Hannibal Heyes: Could be an alias... I heard there are people that
  use 'em.

Jed 'Kid' Curry: What we've got for you is a straight 100%
  proposition.
Hannibal Heyes: That's right, George. We want to borrow $3000 from ya
  and give you half interest on the deal.
Georgette Sinclair: What kind of deal are we talking about here?
Hannibal Heyes: It'll be money in the bank.
Georgette Sinclair: My money *is* in a bank - and I'm not telling you
  which one.

Hannibal Heyes: We're going to have to renegotiate... maybe take half
  of what you get.
Georgette Sinclair: Why, you're thieves!
Hannibal Heyes: Please, George, not so loud. Somebody might take you
  seriously... and be right.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Bushwack! (#3.5)}
Marty Alcott: Ordinarily, I wouldn't ask a question like this, but
  we're in business together. Like to tell me why bein' witnesses
  puts such a scare in ya? Well, I think I got it figured out. Either
  one of you Ben Thompson or Bill Longren? Hannibal Heyes, Wes
  Hardin? Kid Curry, Clay Allison?
Hannibal Heyes: You keep guessin', Marty, and we'll keep smilin'.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Don't Get Mad, Get Even (#2.21)}
[Heyes has just lost all their money playing poker]
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Well, as Grandpa Curry used to say, "You show me a
  poor man and I'll show you a man ain't got any money."


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Dreadful Sorry Clementine (#2.10)}
Hannibal Heyes: Clem, you're the one who used to tell us, "Crime
  doesn't pay!"
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Yeah, Clem, what happened to you?
Clementine Hale: I discovered greed.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Everything Else You Can Steal (#2.13)}
Hannibal Heyes: I'm Smith. The Kid is Jones.
Blackjack Jenny: You mean it makes a difference?


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Exit from Wickenburg (#1.3)}
Mike: What'll you have, gentlemen?
Hannibal Heyes: Well, what have you got?
Mike: Well, we got real good whiskey and the regular.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: What's the difference?
Mike: The good whiskey comes in a clean glass.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Never Trust an Honest Man (#1.14)}
[Logan and Preacher get ready to ambush Heyes and Curry]
Logan: Didja have to finish the whole bottle?
Preacher: Yep. That way, I can convince myself I don't know what I'm
  doing.
Logan: You probably couldn't shoot and hit the ground.
Preacher: Drunk or sober, Logan, I never miss. It's my lone remaining
  virtue, such as it is.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Night of the Red Dog (#2.8)}
Dr. Chauncey Beauregard: Well, as they said in medical school in
  Atlanta: character is fate.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Return to Devil's Hole (#1.7)}
Hannibal Heyes: Don't worry, outlaws never shoot ladies.
Clara Phillips: You mean they have a code of honor?
Hannibal Heyes: No, they have a shortage of ladies.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {The Bounty Hunter (#2.12)}
Hannibal Heyes: Just tell me one thing. Why are you so all fired
  ornery?
Joe Sims: Nothin' I can do about that. Some black folks, ya know,
  figure they owe white folks a lotta harm fo rall what they done. I
  don't feel that way. I don't feel I owe 'em any harm. I don't feel
  I owe 'em anything else, either. I guess that's why I don't know
  nothin' about gratitude. It been taken outta me a long time ago.
Hannibal Heyes: That's sad, Joe. That's a sad way to be.
Joe Sims: I guess...


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {The Day the Amnesty Came Through (#3.8)}
[toasting]
Sheriff Lom Trevors: Well, here's to life!
Jed 'Kid' Curry: I thought we were only supposed to get twenty years.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {The Man Who Broke the Bank at Red Gap (#2.17)}
Winford Fletcher: Mr. Powers, I can certainly understand how you
  became president of a bank.
Powers: I inherited it.

[Powers' plan to frame Heyes and Curry for bank robbery backfires]
Jed 'Kid' Curry: You know, Heyes, one basic business principle old
  Chester E. Powers never learned.
Hannibal Heyes: *Crime doesn't pay*.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Nope. Never can involved in another man's game.

Winford Fletcher: Dear Winford. You really ought to get a new safe.
  Even my friend what's-his-name could have opened up this one. J.
  Smith.

Hannibal Heyes: Will you shut up and let me scheme?

Hannibal Heyes: Will you shut up and let me scheme?


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {The Man Who Murdered Himself (#1.10)}
Julia Finney: Are you saying I was pretending to be sick?
Hannibal Heyes: No, I'm saying the doctor said you were pretending to
  be sick.

Hank: How's Kid Curry?
Hannibal Heyes: Hank, I wish I knew.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {The McCreedy Feud (#3.3)}
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Heyes, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we just
  almost get ourselves killed twice so we could get to Santa Marta?
Hannibal Heyes: I gotta correct you, Kid, but you can't get killed
  twice. Once is the limit, even for us.

Hannibal Heyes: Kid, I think I know what that missin' ingredient is.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Brains?
Hannibal Heyes: Our gal Clementine.
[to horse]
Hannibal Heyes: Come on, giddyap!
Jed 'Kid' Curry: I still think the missing ingredient is brains!

Jed 'Kid' Curry: Heyes, you got a good head for figures.
Hannibal Heyes: Uh-huh. Of *all* kinds.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: How many times have I asked you what we're doing?
Hannibal Heyes: Too many times.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Well, that's a shame, 'cause I'm about to ask you
  again. What are we doin' here?
Hannibal Heyes: We got five hundred good reasons for bein' here here,
  Kid. You can count 'em yourself when we get finished.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Yeah, well, I never saw a coffin yet that had
  pockets in it.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {The Root of It All (#1.11)}
Leslie O'Hara: [while riding in a stagecoach] Oh, we came to look at
  the wild West.
Hannibal Heyes: I hate to disappoint you, but it's not like that any
  more. You couldn't be safer in your own backyard.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: I wouldn't say that Joshua. One morning three weeks
  ago, we were on a stage that was held up. By a band of very
  desperate men.
Margaret Chapman: You mean that could happen to us?
Hannibal Heyes: It could happen to you but not to us. Not twice in
  three weeks.
[gunshots are fired, the stage is robbed]


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {What Happened at the XST? (#3.6)}
Hannibal Heyes: Kid, you ever notice anything strange about the snow
  in Wyoming?
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Yeah, I have Heyes...
Hannibal Heyes: You have what?
Jed 'Kid' Curry: I've noticed something strange about the snow in
  Wyoming. It doesn't melt. It just blows around till it wears out.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {What's in It for Mia? (#2.22)}
Jed 'Kid' Curry: We try to avoid violence at all times, not to
  mention anything illegal.
Hannibal Heyes: Sometimes shady, perhaps, but never illegal.


# "Alias Smith and Jones" (1971) {Which Way to the O.K. Corral? (#2.20)}
Jed 'Kid' Curry: We're going to Tombstone?
Hannibal Heyes: We can be there tomorrow.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: Heyes, you know who the law is down there?
Hannibal Heyes: He doesn't know us!
Jed 'Kid' Curry: But our descriptions are hanging on his office wall.
  You want a man like that wondering who we are?
Hannibal Heyes: Kid, reputations are like shadows. They're usually a
  whole lot taller than the man they belong to. Why, five years from
  now, there won't be two people in the whole country who'll remember
  the marshal of Tombstone. What kind of name is that anyway? Earp.
Dispatcher: You two made up your minds? We got a schedule to keep.
Hannibal Heyes: Tombstone! Two.
[buys tickets]
Dispatcher: One way?
Jed 'Kid' Curry: It wouldn't surprise me.

Georgette Sinclair: There I was alone in Denver, not accomplishing a
  thing. So I decided to do something with my life.
Hannibal Heyes: In Tombstone?
Jed 'Kid' Curry: That's kind of a wide-open town, George.
Georgette Sinclair: I'm going to work in the Birdcage Saloon!
Jed 'Kid' Curry: George, you know how most saloon girls end up.
Georgette Sinclair: Fellas, I'm not going to Tombstone to work as a
  saloon girl... I'm going to become a chanteuse.
Jed 'Kid' Curry: A what?
Hannibal Heyes: [laughs] I don't know, Kid, but it don't sound good.


# "Alias" (2001)
Vaughn: Look, if I'm not back in a couple of hours I'm probably dead.
Agent Eric Weiss: Good to know.

Vaughn: Let's take things one step at a time. This is a charge of C4.
  I can tell because there's 'C4' written all over it.

McKenas Cole: Dear person... beating up my men...

Agent Jack Bristow: Shepard killed Danny. I'm assuming you know that.
Sydney: If I hadn't, thank you for breaking it to me so gently.

Marcus Dixon: Listen, while you're grabbing the Rambaldi manuscript,
  if you happen to see a sandwich...
Sydney: You got it.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: He also happens to own the largest
  collection of pornographic art in all of Madrid. Which... I thought
  was an interesting fact. Sorry.

Sloane: Marshall, would you please go back to work?
Agent Marshall Flinkman: Just to clarify, I'm not being fired?
Sloane: Back to work means not fired.

Sydney: Who am I talking to?
Vaughn: Your invisible friend.
Sydney: Good. Where are you?
Vaughn: Satellite relay station back in L.A., watching you from a 200
  mile orbit.
Sydney: My guardian angel.

Sydney: How do I look?
Marcus Dixon: For the record, that's a question you never have to
  ask.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: [showing off his ring gadget] Mr. Bristow,
  will you marry me?

Sark: [repeated line to Lauren] Not if I see you first, love.

Irina: Sydney, you may not see me at your wedding. But I will see
  you.

Vaughn: Syd, come here. [sits next to him] I had it all planned out.
  I was gonna take you to the beach. Santa Barbara. We'd go out for a
  walk, maybe when the sun was setting. But now we're here and I
  don't know what we're jumping into and I may never get another
  chance to do this again. Sometimes I wake up before you do and I
  watch you sleep and I'm overwhelmed because you're so amazing and I
  don't know why I'm lucky enough to have you in my life; that you're
  here with me. And I know that I want to spend the rest of my life
  with you trying to make you as happy as you make me.
Sydney: Oh, my God, Vaughn.
Vaughn: Sydney Bristow, will you marry me? [she kisses him] Is that a
  yes?
Sydney: [kisses him again] Ask me on the beach.
[they smile at each other]

Vaughn: [Syd and Vaughn are about to approach a source for
  information] How do you wanna play this?
Sydney: You wanna be rough, or you want me to be rough?
Vaughn: You're always rough.
Sydney: No, I'm not.
Vaughn: Yes, you are.
Sydney: That's not true!
Vaughn: Yes, it is.
Sydney: Are you talking about at home, or on Ops?
Vaughn: Both. Hey, I'm not complaining!
Sydney: If I'm rough, it's because you like me to... [pauses] Are we
  on coms?
Agent Jack Bristow: Yes, you're both on coms right now.

Jack: What you need to do is find a way to accept what's happened. If
  you can deal with Arvin Sloane...
Sydney: I love that you knew that. That you approved it.
Jack: It may be hard for you to accept that your father doesn't have
  the authority to...
Sydney: No, what's hard to accept are the decisions you do make.
  What's hard is looking at you. Walking past you. Smelling that
  sickening cologne. And what's hard is being your daughter and not
  being able to separate myself as far as I may get from the person I
  despise the most.

Sydney: Have I told you that I love you?
Vaughn: Yeah. Go ahead and tell me again.
Sydney: I love you. [she touches Vaughn's face and smiles]
Vaughn: [Vaughn sighs] I love you too.
Sydney: I know. Say it again.
Vaughn: I love you, Syd. That's why I need to tell you something.
  Just so there's no secrets between us.
Sydney: Okay, whatever it is I can handle it, just don't tell me
  you're a bad guy. You're not a bad guy are you?
Vaughn: I guess that depends who you ask.
Sydney: Vaughn...
Vaughn: It's from a long time ago. Before we met. Actually, it's the
  reason we met. It's no accident that I was the one you came to when
  you walked in the CIA with your story about SD-6.
Sydney: Wait. Vaughn, I don't understand. What are you telling me?
Vaughn: Well, for starters, my name isn't Michael Vaughn. [car
  crashes into theirs from the side]

[Katya kisses Jack]
Katya Derevko: That was from Irina.
Jack: Okay.
[Katya plants a hot and heavy kiss on Jack]
Jack: And *who* was that from?
Katya Derevko: You ask too many questions.

Sydney: [talking to Sloane] The thought that I did something for you
  that might give you a warm and fuzzy feeling makes me want to kick
  my own sister out of my house.

[singing his son to sleep]
Agent Marshall Flinkman: Hush... hush... hush little Mitchell, don't
  you cry. Daddy's here to teach you about Lanthanides. Cerium is
  first, yes it leads the way. Hexagonal structure and it's iron
  gray. Praseodymium is next and it looks like brass...

[Marshall has to infiltrate a German nightclub; he is communicating
  with Sydney with an earpiece]
Agent Marshall Flinkman: Okay, I'm in. Now what do I do?
Sydney: What do you see?
Agent Marshall Flinkman: Well, a lot of people who are into spanking,
  apparently. [a random woman grabs him and kisses him] Oh my god, I
  think I just got hepatitis.

[Marshall has accidentally shot a man; they need the man's eyes for a
  retinal scan. Marshall digs into one eye with a letter opener]
Agent Marshall Flinkman: Oh god. It's oozing. It's oozing everywhere,
  sir.
Agent Jack Bristow: [via cell phone] That means you've ruptured the
  macula. The eye is useless, abandon it. Approach the second one
  gently, like a soft-boiled egg. You're going to need a digging
  instrument to assist with this.
Agent Marshall Flinkman: [looks in a drawer] I've got a spork.
Agent Jack Bristow: [bewildered] What's a spork?
Agent Marshall Flinkman: It's like a half-spoon... half-fork, will
  that do?
Agent Jack Bristow: That will work.

[Sydney and Vaughn are undercover as a married couple]
[Phil looks at Sydney's ring and whistles]
Phil: How'd he pop the question?
Sydney: [hesitates, trying to think of an answer] He... took me...
  to...
Vaughn: Santa Barbara. Actually... I had this whole romantic weekend
  planned. Presidential suite at the Biltmore, candlelit dinner on
  the cliffs over looking the ocean. So we went into town and she
  wouldn't stop talkin' about the zoo. So we went to the zoo. Figured
  I'd get it over with. [looks into Sydney's eyes] Then I saw how
  happy it made her... and it made me forget about all my stupid
  plans. Here we had a personal chef making this unbelievable meal at
  the hotel and... I proposed on one knee in sawdust in front of a
  giraffe with a crooked neck.
[Sydney and Vaughn stare into each other eyes]

Vaughn: [undercover as a priest] I was married... for a short time.
Kiera MacLaine: That being your secret?
Vaughn: That... being part of it. Now obviously, that was... before I
  had... the collar. The woman I was married to betrayed me. She
  betrayed a lot of people. And when I found out what she'd done, I
  let my... my hate for her consumed me. And I began to wish, the
  woman I loved, was dead. I woke up everyday imagining how I'd do
  it. What was the best way, what was the most efficient way. I mean,
  it's all I wanted. That woman was evil and deserved to be punished.
  So, I killed her. And although that woman was the worst kind of
  evil, I also know that killing her was wrong. I don't sleep much. I
  can't... I can't close my eyes without... without seeing it...
  that... that moment. That look on her face. She won't leave me. She
  won't.

Weiss: Come on, what do you want me to say? If you think I'm going to
  tell you to stay in a loveless marriage...
Vaughn: It's not a loveless marriage.
Weiss: Whatever. And if you're waiting for me to tell you to leave
  your wife for another woman, you can forget about that, too.
Vaughn: Do you think you can be in love with two people at the same
  time?
Weiss: No. I don't. However, I did have the same intense feelings for
  both Sporty and Posh Spice.
Vaughn: Yeah, who didn't?

Irina: How do you say thank you to the woman who killed your father?
Vaughn: I don't.

[Sloane is asked if he has any last words]
Sloane: I do. For you who pay witness, I can only believe there is a
  common thought amongst you all - this is as it should be. I do not
  disagree. My only request - that if my daughter is in fact found
  alive, that she understand my actions. That she understand that
  this day's events are the net result of her father's passion to
  find her... to know her... to love her.

Irina: I'll tell you what you need to know.
Sydney: Get off the ledge NOW!
Irina: Sloane believes he's been chosen to realize the word of
  Rambaldi. But you, too, have been chosen.
Sydney: If you think I'm bluffing...
Irina: It's you in the prophecy, Sydney, not me. Only you can stop
  him. Good luck, sweetheart.
Sydney: Get down now!
Irina: I love you.

[to Vaughn]
Agent Jack Bristow: And, just because you have gotten comfortable
  with my daughter doesn't mean you can get comfortable with me.

Sydney: Is that a hickey?

Lauren: Michael, what are you doing?
[Vaughn looks at her phone]
Vaughn: Sometimes I hate my job.
Lauren: Baby, what's going on?
Vaughn: You know how doctors always make you wait?
Lauren: What?
Vaughn: When you go in for an appointment. My dad hated that. He used
  to say he'd always kept his appointments, and everyone else should
  do the same.
Lauren: You okay?
Vaughn: Yeah. I just... I was looking for my house keys and I found
  this.
[shows her the watch]
Lauren: Why? Were you looking for your house keys?
Vaughn: I couldn't sleep. I thought I'd go for a jog.
Lauren: What time is it?
Vaughn: I dunno. It's broken.
Lauren: Are you sure you're all right?
Vaughn: Yeah, I'm fine.
[they kiss] I'll see you later.

Vaughn: You asked me some questions. I told you I'd answer them if
  you helped me. You did help me. And I thank you for that.
Irina: I didn't do it for you.
Vaughn: I'm trying to live a normal life... which was always hard,
  given what I do. But it's gotten harder since I met your daughter.
  It's not that knowing her hasn't made my life better. It has. But
  it's also made it that much worse... I think I've said enough.
Irina: The problem, Mr. Vaughn... Is that to the one person who
  matters... You haven't said anything at all.
Vaughn: Listen, this may not mean anything to you, this may not be
  something you understand, or appreciate, but we have rules. Very
  clear, important rules that govern the relationship between a
  handler and his asset.
Irina: And between a man and a woman?

Agent Marshall Flinkman: [to Jack, randomly and smugly in the middle
  of an intense op] Vaughn asked me to lunch.

Irina: Ultimately, you will do whatever you want. That's what free
  will's all about.

Irina: Ultimately you'll do what you want, that's what free will's
  all about.

Sophia Vargas/Elena Derevko: Eric, you have no idea how exited I am
  to meet you. Nadia says the most beautiful things about you. [she
  walks away]
Agent Eric Weiss: [obviously happy] Really?
Nadia Santos: She asked me if you were tall, dark and handsome. I
  told her you were tall. [they kiss]

Irina: [Vaughn has come to ask a favor of Irina] Tell me how you feel
  about my daughter.
Vaughn: That's none of your business.
Irina: Are you in love with her?
Vaughn: I don't know why that matters.
Irina: [cutting him off] I don't have the advantage of observing
  casual behavior... I'm curious.
Vaughn: Help me... and I'll tell you what you want to know.

Jack: [during Sydney's hallucination] Shh. Don't talk. You can't
  imagine how much I hate it when you talk. I had a desperate need to
  stop her voice from ringing in my ears. What torments me now is
  that every time I look at you, I see your mother's face.

Arvin Sloane: No! Do you think this is what this is about?
  Immortality? You bought the rumor, you simple-minded dilettante!
  The mystery, the true secrets of these creations will always be
  kept from you... the unworthy!

Suit and Glasses: [leaning over Sydney, who is cuffed to a chair] I'd
  rather not make this too painful.
Sydney: Me too. Thanks. Glad we're on the same page. That's good.

Irina: [Sydney is confronted by her mother for the first time since
  she was six] I've waited almost thirty years for this... You must
  have known this day would come. I could have prevented all this, of
  course... You were so small when you were born. It would have been
  so easy... Tell me... Sydney... Who sent you here? You must tell
  me.
Sydney: Or what? I'm grounded? [Irina shoots Sydney in the shoulder]
Irina: Tell you what. Think about it. I'll come back and ask you
  again.

Vaughn: I've... I've got this aunt, umm, Aunt Trish. She's the insane
  one in the family. She uh speaks to the dead, goes to readings, uh,
  she's a crop circle worshipper.
Sydney: Aunt Trish
Vaughn: Yeah. This whole Rambaldi thing reminds me of something she
  would tell me about.

Sydney: [to Vaughn] There's something that happens when you discover
  the truth about someone. I know a little about this. The truth
  changes everything. There's this woman, a personality, like a
  collage I've put together from the photographs, the few memories I
  have, the scraps of stories I've heard, the clothes of hers I've
  got, her books. And none of its real. She wasn't that woman at all,
  she was - she was a horrible person... Who killed you father...
  Vaughn, I just wanted to say... that I'm so sorry.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: [after a random woman kisses him in a bar] I
  think I just got Hepatitis

Agent Marshall Flinkman: Syd, this guy buried you alive.
Sydney: Yeah, but he cheated, he hit me with a car first!

[after Marshall has been recruited to A.P.O.; on their first mission]
Agent Marshall Flinkman: [to Dixon] How cool is this? Stealing a
  sword so we can find a bad guy... in order to catch an even bigger
  bad guy? Come on... come on, you'd have never let us do this back
  at the CI... you know, when you were double-breasted, serious
  [mechanial voice] Robot Dixon... [Dixon is not amused] I mean, not
  that you were... authoritative... Sorry...

[Vaughn is beating a punching bag, obviously angry]
Agent Eric Weiss: The bag is dead, I think you can stop now.
Vaughn: Thanks for coming.
Agent Eric Weiss: Thanks for sweating.

Agent Jack Bristow: [Jack and Sydney are sitting in silence] This is
  the best conversation we've had in weeks.

Kazu Tamazaki: [preparing to torture Sydney] Did you eat breakfast?
Sydney: Why? You wanna grab something?

Weiss: Jack is going to shoot you in the face.
Vaughn: Just give me a half-hour head start. Tell him that she called
  your phone and you gave it to me. We only have ten hours to find
  Kaplan.
Weiss: If we end up sharing a cell in federal prison, I'm not giving
  you a drawer.

Irina: I remember the first time you introduced me to Sloane. You
  were both working at the CIA, he came to the house for dinner. You
  were true friends.
Jack: Yes. We shared a similar unsentimental patriotism... and a
  devotion to our wives. But Sloane changed and... it was Rambaldi
  that did it. I'm not sure what it is - he never told me - but
  Sloane has a personal connection to Rambaldi.
Irina: I lived for years with the same obsession, to find a higher
  meaning in Rambaldi's work. I never understood how you managed to
  avoid getting caught up in it.
Jack: I had something neither of you did.
Irina: Sydney.

Irina: I see through you. You must know that.
Sloane: This is who I am.
Irina: You may need to think of yourself as an honorable husband, a
  father figure. But I don't. I will never see that man in you, which
  frankly is why we have this agreement.
Sloane: You need to get some rest.
Irina: Never talk to me about your love for Sydney again.

Sloane: She was a KGB spy who cared nothing about you or me. I've
  always thought that you understood your relationship with Irina was
  nothing more than that. But now that your schoolboy crush on the
  woman who destroyed your life is preventing you from saving mine, I
  will have to revise that assessment.

Sydney: Is something wrong?
Vaughn: No. I'm just getting old, I guess.
Sydney: You expect me to believe that?
Vaughn: I've just had a lot on my mind lately, that's all. It'll
  pass.
Sydney: Yesterday was the day, wasn't it? The anniversary of your
  father's death?
Vaughn: How could you remember that?
Sydney: I remember what missing him does to you.

Lauren: Hello?
Sark: It killed you, didn't it, seeing him drop the gun for Sydney.
Lauren: No it isn't a good time, can I call you in the morning?
Sark: He's there with you, is that it? Though he'd rather be with
  her. You know, it's quite a charade you two are engaged in.
Lauren: I think we both know how dedicated I am to this assignment.
  If you have any issues, take it up through the proper channels.
Sark: Don't mistake me. It's not your dedication that I question.
Lauren: We'll talk about this later.

Arvin Sloane: [to Agent Jack Bristow] One night - oh, this was years
  ago, maybe two years before you and I met - I had just finished my
  first Far East briefing in the White House. I was new to the CIA.
  After that meeting, everyone got into a limousine to head back to
  Langley, but I didn't. I told them I was gonna walk for a while.
  They all looked at me sort of funny, I mean, it was a cold night.
  So I said 'I need to get some air,' but the truth is... I was
  overcome. It did occur to me, as I was walking down the White House
  steps, that I was living in a perfect moment. Everything was filled
  with promise: my role in the CIA, my relationship with a wife that
  I had not yet met. Still, I could feel the darkness coming. So I
  wandered around for a while, ended up at Jefferson Memorial. It was
  always my favorite one. Looked out across the basin. Lincoln, right
  there. I didn't know how it would finally materialize, the
  darkness. I had nothing to base it on. It wasn't as if the CIA had
  just betrayed me, or my wife had just been diagnosed with lymphoma.
  None of that had happened yet. So whenever life takes an
  unfortunate turn, as it has this week, I just remind myself that I
  could see it coming all along.

Lauren Reed: Not everything was a lie.

Vaughn: Even though everything's changed... some things don't... I'm
  not going to lose you twice.

Agent Jack Bristow: Those Cyrillic codes you found in those books -
  yes, they were orders from the KGB and yes, they were orders to
  kill. An agent received those orders and carried them out,
  murdering officers of the C.I.A., including your father, Mr.
  Vaughn. All this is true. But, Sydney, I was not that agent. Your
  mother was.

Vaughn: I'm going to say something, and it will either be obvious to
  you or seem presumptuous, either way I'm going to say it. This
  isn't working. I've been thinking about this for a while, I don't
  know what the hell to do.
Sydney: What?
Vaughn: I think you know what.
Sydney: I need you to tell me.
Vaughn: You need me to tell you what, that when you're on operations
  I can't sleep at night, that when we're in debrief I have to force
  myself to remember what the hell we're supposed to be reviewing
  when all I want to do is kiss you.
Sydney: Sometimes it is hard to remember what we're supposed to be
  talking about.
Vaughn: That's what I'm talking about, and the thing that drives me
  insane every day is that the people who would kill us if we were
  ever seen together-the Alliance, SD-6, Sloane, are the very forces
  that brought you into my life. What kind of a sick joke is that?
Sydney: So what are you thinking, that maybe we shouldn't be working
  together?
Vaughn: Yes, that was what I was thinking, but we're great together,
  and the more we work together the sooner the Alliance gets
  destroyed.
Sydney: So, what are you suggesting?
[Agent Weiss interrupts]

Rachel Gibson: Your father is kind of scary.
Sydney: Tell me about it.

Agent Eric Weiss: You really want some space, or are you and I going
  to go get drunk? 'Cause there's this bar - you won't even remember
  it tomorrow.

Francie: "Dear Aunt Stephanie. Unfortunately, as my mother has
  informed you, the wedding is off so I am returning your kind gift
  of a coffee maker because, as it turns out, the man to whom I was
  engaged is a deceitful, two-faced, sex-crazed jackass. All my love,
  Francie."
Sydney: It's not too harsh.

Sydney: What are you, twelve years old?

Francie: No, no, no. We need a professional. We need a hit man. If
  there's one, there are a thousand. Rats breed hourly.

Sydney: [sing-song] I'm going shoppin'.

Sydney: Those men died for no reason.
Vaughn: No. Those men died for their country.

Agent Jack Bristow: Mr. Vaughn, you're young and you're eager, and I
  understand that. But one thing you're not, and this is something
  only time can provide, really, is wise.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: They're super-swank.

Sydney: My name is Sydney Bristow. I've seen you in the office. I
  always wondered what you did. Aah. I guess this is what you do.

Vaughn: Half a can only. I don't want to come back to a fat dog.

Sydney: Why are you looking at me like that? Did you guys break
  something of mine?

Will: I know, I just don't want to miss the previews, though.
  They're, like, my favorite part.

Agent Jack Bristow: If you tell anyone about this conversation, you
  will no longer be able to wear a hat.

Vaughn: Now, the guys say it's bitchin, so I assume it's... bitchin.

Sydney: I just wanted to rip his finger right off again. Does that
  make me a bad person?

Haladki: I think your judgment is impaired.
Vaughn: I think I'm going to kick your ass.

McKenas Cole: Oh, wow, that was a moderately clever retort.

Will: So, I'm not annoying to dead people.

Sydney: My name is Sydney Bristow. Seven years ago I was recruited by
  a secret branch of the CIA called SD-6. I was sworn to secrecy, but
  I couldn't keep it from my fianc". And when the head of SD-6 found
  out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth: SD-6 is
  not part of the CIA. I've been working for the very people I
  thought I was fighting against. So, I went to the only place that
  could help me take them down. Now I'm a double agent for the CIA,
  where my handler is a man named Michael Vaughn. Only one other
  person knows the truth about what I do, another double agent inside
  SD-6. Someone I hardly know - my father.

Sydney: Well, go ahead and raid my closet.
Francie: Thanks... but I've got boobs.

Sydney: Amazing idea.
Vaughn: Thank you. I know.

Marcus Dixon: We kill ourselves to do the right thing, meanwhile the
  bad people keep coming back.

Will: Who would live a double life like that?
Sydney: There are people.

McKenas Cole: [to Sydney] Now, I know I'm not the subtlest guy when
  it comes to women and I probably said something insanely
  inappropriate, because you told me if I ever talked to you again,
  you'd break my kneecaps. Which just made me love you.

McKenas Cole: I am now standing in Sloan's... tastefully minimalistic
  office.

Sydney: Why does that guy have such a guilty look on his face?
Francie: Yesterday, Ginger told Rod that Gavin was Ruby's pimp, but
  Rod didn't even know that Ruby was a prostitute...
Sydney: Who's Gavin?
Francie: Ruby's father.
Sydney: Ew.

Sydney: This is ridiculous, let's just get the son of a bitch.

[repeated lines of Sydney's contact code]
Sydney: [answering a phone] Hello?
Person on Phone: Joey's Pizza?
Sydney: Wrong number.

Vaughn: You just threw your pager into the Pacific.
Sydney: I know.

Francie: What? You kissed Will Tippin? Are you kidding me?

Jenny: That was Sydney, right? You're different when you talk to
  Sydney.
Will: Don't analyze me.

Sydney: The highlight of my social-life was my dorms salad-bar.

Sydney: Your dancers... suck.

[discussing Will's hickey]
Will: It's very embarrassing.
Sydney: What, the fact that I saw it or just that it's there at all?
Will: Look at it. I feel like I'm 15 years old.
Sydney: That's about the age of your intern.

Sakkoulas: Ah, you are American.
Sydney: That's right. God bless America.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: Sorry I've got hives.

Sydney: OK so you're acting really freaky.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: That sound that you're- you know, that
  'boom'? That's my mind blowing.

Sydney: What about Will?
Agent Jack Bristow: [turns to Will]You're gonna have a hard time.

Sydney: I'm gonna shoot you with adrenaline - we have got to run.
Vaughn: No. Don't do that.

Will: You awkward?
Sydney: Yeah, small eyes and big teeth, and I was always a foot
  taller than everybody else so I kind of hunched over.
Will: I wish I could've seen that.

[Sydney's pager beeps]
Will: You can just say good guys or bad guys.
Sydney: Neither, my father.

Vaughn: This watch belonged to my father. It's broken now, but it
  used to keep perfect time. And when he gave it to me, he said you
  could set your heart by this watch. It stopped October 1st. The day
  we met.
Sydney: Me too.

Agent Jack Bristow: The illusion of freedom is better than none at
  all.

Vaughn: You're not the easiest guy to work with.
Kendall: No. No, definitely not.

[Sydney and Marshall have just talked their way past a security post]
Sydney: What did you say to him?
Agent Marshall Flinkman: [nervous] I don't know. I think it was "Go
  away I can smell you from here" in Ewok.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: My name is Marshall J. Flinkman, and I'm
  here to rescue you.

Marcus Dixon: [shouting] Are you ready to party?
Sydney: Are you ready to party?
Marcus Dixon: I speak nine languages. Techno is not one of them.

[Vaughn is watching Syndey seduce an obese enemy agent]
Vaughn: I'm going to kill that guy.

[Vaughn and Weiss watch as a sleazy bad guy leers at Sydney while
  she's in disguise as a prostitute]
Vaughn: That son of a bitch!
Weiss: Easy, come on.
Vaughn: I swear I'm gonna to kill this guy.
Weiss: There's no way that guy smells as good as you do.
Vaughn: It's aftershave, I got a new aftershave.
Weiss: Yeah, well, I'd lighten up on it a little.
Vaughn: Yeah?
Weiss: Oh yeah. To the point of non-use.

Agent Eric Weiss: Did you ever stop to think that the reason you and
  Sydney work so well together is because of the feelings you have
  for each other? [pause] How's that for spin?
Vaughn: Pretty good.

[after Sydney asks if he is married]
Vaughn: Wife? I don't have a wife. You thought I was married this
  whole time?

Vaughn: Are you romantically interested in anyone?
[She looks at him weirdly]
Vaughn: It could be a question.
Sydney: No, I'm not.
[Machine jumps to 56]
Vaughn: Interesting.
Sydney: Wait, ask me that again.
Vaughn: No, I don't have to. We have our answer right here. That's
  very good. Moving on.

Sark: Good luck.
Sydney: I don't need luck from you, you son of a bitch.
Sark: Wonderful attitude.

[Marshall is offered a job with the real CIA]
Vaughn: Hi, I'm Michael Vaughn. Welcome to the CIA.
Agent Marshall Flinkman: Uh, yeah I've heard that one before.

Sydney: Vaughn?
Vaughn: How come you never call me Michael?
Sydney: I call you Michael sometimes.
[pause]
Sydney: Vaughn.

[Sydney and Vaughn walk into Syd's apartment, Vaughn's cell phone
  rings]
Vaughn: Hello?
Agent Eric Weiss: Hey, Kendall has something he wants to show you.
Vaughn: Ah, can it wait?
Agent Eric Weiss: Apparently not, he wants to Sydney too. Are you
  with her?
Vaughn: Ah, no. I haven't seen her.
Agent Eric Weiss: You're in bed with her right now, aren't you?
Vaughn: Trying. Just find out what he wants.

[the Francie clone has hypnotized Will Tippen]
Francie: [as Allison] Now I'm going to count back from five, and when
  you wake up, you will remember nothing of this conversation. All
  you will remember is that you had the best sex of your life.

Sark: You know it's a pity we're traveling separately. We could've
  used the opportunity to get to know each other better.
Sydney: Yeah, I'm broken up about that too.
Sark: You're surprisingly adept at keeping your curiosity in check.
Sydney: Don't flatter yourself.

[about Kendall]
Agent Jack Bristow: Legally he's right, Ethically he's an ass.

Sydney: The idea that the CIA is willing to work with Irina Derevko
  is insane.
Agent Jack Bristow: Worse, it's naive. Your mother didn't just
  conveniently turn herself in. This is all part of the manipulation.
Sydney: Well, she's their problem now. She's not yours. And she's not
  mine.
[When putting on her jacket, she winces a little bit]
Agent Jack Bristow: You okay?
Sydney: My shoulder's healing, if that's what you mean.
Agent Jack Bristow: It's not, actually.

Sydney: I don't support the death penalty. I but I hope she dies for
  all that she has done. I really do.

Kendall: Just so we're clear, Mr. Vaughn, I know all about your
  participation in busting Agent Bristow out of federal custody.
  Convince her to talk to her mother, or face charges of obstructing
  justice and harboring a fugitive.
Vaughn: Guess it's two-for-one day on blackmail.

Vaughn: Respectfully Syd, I don't think your father can think clearly
  where your mother is concerned.
Sydney: And you can?
Vaughn: I'm trying and she has nothing to gain by lying.

Sydney: Some people go miniature golfing with their parents. We go to
  India to look for nukes.

Sydney: Dad, we need to get moving.
Agent Jack Bristow: I know. I'm just preparing myself to let Irina
  out.

Vaughn: You're probably gonna say no to this, but I wanna go to
  India.
Kendall: Go.
Vaughn: "Go"? What... Are you trying to get rid of me?

Sydney: Call waiting for spies.

[an alarm will go off in 15 seconds if set off]
Vaughn: So you said you could disarm it in under 20 seconds, how far
  under 20?
Sydney: I work better under pressure.

Agent Jack Bristow: Your mother was sent to the United States to
  steal secrets from a ranking officer of the C.I.A. How she and I
  happened to meet, how she supposedly fell in love, I thought it was
  all true. But it was just a set-up.

C.I.A. Therapist Dr. Judy Barnett: Did you purchase a Christmas gift
  for Agent Bristow?
Vaughn: Uh... I'm not familiar, Dr. Barnett, with the regulations
  preventing officers from celebrating with their co-workers, a
  fairly widely recognized holiday such as Christmas.

Vaughn: [ to Sydney] No, but, what you said about wanting to go to a
  hockey game... wanting me to be part of your life... I think I
  wasn't clear about something. That it would be nice to be in public
  with you, to actually get to look at you. Grab a pizza or go to a
  hockey game. I just... I wasn't clear that I would really like
  that, too.

Will: I have a contact who tracked your credit card from another one
  of your flights out of L.A.X. From that, they got your social
  security number. I did a trace on it. See, here's what doesn't make
  any sense, Kate Jones. You died in 1973.

Sydney: You didn't think about it. Not once. The possibility that
  Rambaldi could be right about me.
Vaughn: No. I didn't.
Sydney: Why not?
Vaughn: Because I believe in you. Do you think I'd just throw anyone
  in my trunk?

Noah Hicks: I told you to meet me in San Pedro.
Sydney: I never got a letter.
Noah Hicks: I didn't send you a letter. I wasn't allowed to discuss
  my reassignment. I encoded a message in a junk e-mail. You
  should've been able to pick it up from the subject line.
Sydney: I always set my computer to filter out junk e-mail.

Vaughn: Noah Hicks - you mentioned him in the initial background
  report you wrote when you first made contact with the CIA.
Sydney: We met when I was a trainee. We actually dated for a while.
Vaughn: Really.
Sydney: We kept it under the radar. SD-6 discourages, you know,
  fraternization among agents.
Vaughn: So does the CIA.

Vaughn: [to Sydney] When you're at your absolute lowest, at your most
  depressed, just remember that you can always... you know. You got
  my number.

Vaughn: Yeah... I'll break into the Vatican with you.

Francie: Okay, seriously, we are not putting chocolate chips in the
  pancakes.
Will: I got news for you. Oh yes we are.

Vaughn: So, I was thinking, later tonight when we get the code key,
  maybe we can check it out?
Sydney: What, the restaurant?
Vaughn: Yeah. Well, it's almost too good not to.
Sydney: Unless SD-6 spots us there and has us killed.
Vaughn: Well, the food's so good it's almost worth the risk.

Vaughn: Uh, I don't have an easy answer to that.
Kendall: I'll take a complicated one.

Sydney: You've lost weight.
Agent Eric Weiss: Yeah, I stopped eating all the foods I like. I'm
  miserable, but I look really good.

Sark: Are you comfortable? Do you feel comfortable trading priceless
  documents for a low-grade reporter?
Agent Jack Bristow: You should read Tippin's stuff. It's not so bad.

Agent Eric Weiss: You don't poop where you sleep.

Sloane: You know, we should dance.
Sydney: Like hell.

NSC Director Robert Lindsey: If you're finished, this is the men's
  room.
Sydney: Who let you in?

Vaughn: If you betray her, no matter what it costs me, I will kill
  you.
Sloane: No need to worry, I love her too.

Sydney: I fought myself. I killed myself.

Marshall: I've lost my keys. Where are they?

[the assassin Sark is introduced as an ally]
Marshall: Hi. Welcome. Don't kill me.

Lauren: This better be good.
Sark: And a good morning to you, too.
Lauren: You paged me on my NSC cell phone. You know that they track
  all incoming numbers.
Sark: This cell phone's been cloned, so you have nothing to worry
  about. We've just learned that a freelance munitions expert has
  created a cutting edge technology, one that he's since sold to one
  of our rivals. We need you to filter back any CIA intel that might
  help us get a lock on it.
Lauren: You called me to remind me to do my job?
Sark: Darling, it's not like that.
Lauren: [sarcastically] Yeah.

Weiss: Will he ever open his eyes?
Marshall: Babies sleep, Weiss, you know. That's what they do, except
  when they're screaming. Last night, from midnight to six.
Sydney: He's gorgeous, Marshall.
Marshall: Thanks.

Lauren: Are you ready for our first job as senior management?
Sark: You're so ambitious, I love it.
Lauren: The job's in Vancouver. Requires a breach of a data storage
  facility.
Sark: Really? What's the prize?
Lauren: A plasma charge. Next generation destructive power.
Sark: I thought those were just theoretical.
Lauren: Apparently not in Vancouver.
Sark: All right. I'll meet you there in four hours.
Lauren: Three. We have to be first in line. The CIA's sending agents.
Sark: Who?
Lauren: One guess.
Sark: Sweetheart, this should be fun.
Lauren: I'll see you in Vancouver. Don't be late or call me
  sweetheart.
Sark: Ambitious and domineering. Fantastic.

Weiss: How are you doing?
Vaughn: Fine.
Weiss: Hey, guess what? It's me. Come on, how're you doing?
Vaughn: I'm hanging in there.
Weiss: How's Lauren about it?
Vaughn: She didn't remember.
Weiss: And, you didn't say anything?
Vaughn: No. I mean, she's got a lot on her mind.
Weiss: Yeah, that's probably it.

Lauren: They're right behind us.
Sark: Yes, thank you. I can see that.

Lauren: Stop the car!
Sark: What are you talking about?
Lauren: Stop the car, now. Pull in here. [they begin to make out]

Sark: Tell me, did they spot us?
Lauren: No, I don't think so. According to the transport order, the
  ship docks in 16 hours. We should get going.
Sark: You should know that you are amazing. Before, I mean.
  Typically, this is where you return the compliment. [Lauren ignores
  him and gets out of bed]

Sark: Put the gun down, Agent Vaughn. Drop the gun.
Vaughn: Not a chance, you drop yours.
Sark: Put the gun down now.
Sydney: No, Vaughn, don't!
Sark: Drop it. If you love her, you will put the gun down now.
[Masked figure looks at Vaughn]
Sydney: Vaughn, don't!
[Vaughn drops the gun]

Vaughn: Freeze! Give me the bomb. Give it to me.
[Sark activates the explosive]
Sark: With pleasure.

Sydney: I thought you'd be home by now.
Jack: I was about to say the same to you. The plasma charge, it's in
  our hands.
Sydney: Sark isn't... the Covenant.
Jack: Have you had dinner? If memory serves, you always liked
  Mitchellis.
Sydney: I haven't eaten there since I was eight.
Jack: I do eat, you know.
Sydney: I'd like that, actually.

[to Vaughn]
Sydney: We'll find each other... we'll always find each other.

Weiss: By the power invested in me by the United Church of Mammals, I
  now pronounce you man and wife.

[Marshall and Carrie get married]
Marshall: I love you Mrs. Flinkman.
Carrie Bowman: I'm keeping my name.
Marshall: Okay.

Lauren: [to Sydney] I see what's going on between you and Michael, so
  let me be clear: stay the hell away from my husband.

McKenas Cole: Welcome, Miss Thorne. The work you'll be doing for us
  requires a certain commitment.
Sydney: [brainwashed as Miss Thorne] Of course.
McKenas Cole: Who this man is, is not important. What is important is
  this knife on the table. Use it. Kill this unimportant man.

Sydney: Last chance to bail out.
Will: What, are you kidding me? I love this stuff.

Will: Syd, you've been going over this since the beginning of time.
  You'll figure it out.
Sydney: What makes you say that?
Will: Because you're you.

Jack: I used to think you didn't have much of a spine.
Vaughn: Has that assessment changed at all?
Jack: No.

Sydney: [about Allison/Francie] Why didn't she kill me?
Weiss: Maybe she likes you.
Sydney: Weiss, I'm serious.
Weiss: So am I! Come on. She lived with you for months. She doubled
  herself as your best friend. Maybe in that time, she started to
  like you. I could see that happening.

Marshall: You've got the looks. I've got the brains.
Vaughn: I've got the looks? You've got the brains?

[about Vaughn]
Sydney: After 30 years, you're still haunted by your wife's betrayal.
  Will it be the same for him?
Jack: Absolutely.

Jack: [to Sloane] I'm not going to help you. Since this is the last
  conversation we will ever have, I want to make this perfectly
  clear. What you have done to my daughter is nothing compared to
  what I will do when I find yours. Salud.

Jack: Surprised you didn't get the reference. Modified kaexelate
  cocktail washed with tetrodotoxin presented in a bottle of
  Chambertin Clos de Bez. Just like we used in Saigon. But
  understand, this was not done out of compassion. I orchestrated
  this because and only because I need you.

Vaughn: My wife betrayed me! She betrayed all of us! You can't expect
  me to pretend that never happened.
Jack: I'm not sure you have a choice.
Vaughn: And why's that?
Jack: Because you're the one that married her.

Katya Derevko: I find you sexy, Jack - deal with it.

Vaughn: I hate you - but I love Sydney more. Which is why you're not
  dying tonight.

Vaughn: I hate you but I love Sydney more, thats the only reason
  you're not dying tonight.

Agent Eric Weiss: What is this, the flirting corner?

Irina: Truth takes time.

Sydney: Hi. How did you find me?
Vaughn: You told me a couple of months ago that when you feel the
  need to disappear, you go to the observatory. But the observatory
  was closed. And then I remembered you said the pier calms you down.
  But you weren't there. And you weren't at the bluffs and the
  palisades, either.
Sydney: You didn't really go to all those places.
Vaughn: Yeah, I did. And then I remembered you liked the train
  station, too. Normal people going to their normal jobs.
Sydney: I can't believe you remember that.

Irina: There were times when the illusion of our marriage was as
  powerful for me as it was for you.

Agent Jack Bristow: When I look at her, when I look at the little
  girl who raised herself to become one of the most extraordinary
  human beings and one of the finest agents I've ever had the
  privilege of knowing, I see only the promise of my own redemption.
  Turning myself in was the only way I could think of to make that
  clear to her, to prove that despite... my limited abilities as a
  father, I love her more than I could ever say.

Vaughn: Hey, what did you say before about Haladki?
Weiss: I don't think he showers?

Weiss: Hey, you sure you don't want to talk about this?
Vaughn: There's nothing to talk about.
Weiss: I share my fights with you.
Vaughn: No you don't.
Weiss: Yeah I do. Remember when Alan pissed in the living room?
Vaughn: That was your dog!
Weiss: Yeah, but I was angry about it and I let you know how upset I
  was.

[Weiss has just prompted Vaughn to finally ask Sydney out on a date
  while on a mission in Nice]
Weiss: And?
Vaughn: We're going to dinner.
[Weiss breaks into a celebratory dance]
Vaughn: I'm going to keep my comm channel open. I need you to monitor
  the RF frequency.
Weiss: Got it. Okay, in exchange I get an eclair.
Vaughn: No, I'm serious, any suspect signal and I want to know about
  it. Anything.
Weiss: If they're small, bring at least two!

Weiss: Okay, whenever you want to have that talk...
Vaughn: What talk?
Weiss: About the cologne or whatever the hell you're wearing.
Vaughn: I'm not wearing cologne.
Weiss: Well, something's going on. No man naturally smells as good as
  you do right now.

Weiss: So, in a case like this, we start by digitizing all the news
  coverage that covered the bombing. You, uh, you like Italian food?
Christine Phillips: I have a boyfriend.
[Weiss looks up as Vaughn walks in the room]
Weiss: Yeah, me too.

Sydney: Weiss, have you seen Vaughn?
Weiss: That's all I am to you - just a conduit to Vaughn. Have you
  ever seen Vaughn and said "Hey, where's Weiss?"

[talking about Sydney]
Weiss: So she gave you a drawer, huh?
Vaughn: It was a gesture of convenience.
Weiss: And, uh, what did you put it in?
Vaughn: Why do you care?
Weiss: What do you mean, why do I care? Do you know how spoiled you
  are? You know, a drawer! I wish I had a girlfriend to say 'Hey, do
  you want a drawer?'
Vaughn: I'll give you a drawer at my place.
Weiss: I don't want a drawer at your place.

Sydney: Dad... I'm going to find her. I have to.
Agent Jack Bristow: Searching for that woman will accomplish nothing!
  No good can come from it!
Sydney: I need to know where she is.
Agent Jack Bristow: Sydney, we don't even know if she's still alive!
Sydney: I know
Agent Jack Bristow: Even if she is, it doesn't change what she did!
Sydney: Dad, I know!
Agent Jack Bristow: Do you expect her just to say..."I'm sorry"?
Sydney: I don't know what to expect!
Agent Jack Bristow: Well, you better know exactly what to expect!...
  What could she ever say... that would satisfy you?

[Jack is doing Nadia's psych evaluation and giving her hypothetical
  situations]
Agent Jack Bristow: While tapping the phone line of a target in New
  Delhi, you're spotted by the enemy. Your partner tells you to
  continue with the mission objective while he neutralizes the
  target. Do you obey him, or fight back?
Nadia Santos: Is the phone system PBX matrix?
Agent Jack Bristow: Just answer the question, please.
Nadia Santos: Why is my partner a man?
Agent Jack Bristow: The sex of your partner is irrelevant.
Nadia Santos: Oh. No, I would not obey. I'd help her fight him off,
  then she and I could finish the job together.

Sydney: [after Vaughn kisses her] Dinner's ready.
Vaughn: You do have an oven you know, we can reheat.

Agent Jack Bristow: [to Sloane] Personally, I would have found it
  anticlimactic, that after expecting to assemble a weapon of
  ultimate power, you ended up with a revelation you could have
  acquired from a fortune cookie.

[Sydney and Vaughn are returning to the US from a mission in Russia]
Vaughn: You know, we have operational command of this aircraft. The
  pilot could take us anywhere we want...
Sydney: [playfully scolding] Our orders are to proceed with our
  extraction. If we were divert this aircraft for our personal use,
  we would get into a lot of trouble.
Vaughn: Yes.
Sydney: [disappointed] Yeah...
Vaughn: Wanna have dinner with me in Paris?
Sydney: [without hesitating] Absolutely.
[they kiss]

Vaughn: [smashes Sark's face into a table] See, when I have a gun, I
  don't just pull the trigger.
Sark: Thank you.
Vaughn: [smashes Sark's face again] Where's Sloane?
Sark: Not a problem; my loyalties are flexible.

Sydney: [while following Francie's boyfriend, Francie starts the car
  immediately after he leaves his house] No, wait until he's a block
  away.
Francie: Look at you getting all into it!
Sydney: [embarrassed] Everyone knows you wait.
Francie: I didn't know you wait.
Sydney: You wait.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: Sloane gave me the finger.

Agent Jack Bristow: Any complications?
Sydney: Well, I think I lost us about $900,000, depending on the
  exchange rate...

Sydney: I'm not like other mums.

Rachel Gibson: I'm the new girl, I panicked on the last mission, and
  everybody's questioning whether I can do it or not. And the truth
  is... I don't know. I'm terrified. But I'm more terrified of not
  trying. So I'm gonna put on my strappy shoes and my tiny dress and
  I'm gonna try. And by this time tomorrow, we'll know if I can do it
  or not.

Rachel Gibson: Oh, my God, you're...
Kelly Peyton: Not dead?
Rachel Gibson: I was gonna say evil, but...

Irina: [Irina, Sydney, and Jack are walking through a mine field] So,
  Sydney, how's school?
Sydney: I'm working on my dissertation. Supposedly.

Sydney: You know any jokes? Because I could use one.
Vaughn: This grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says,
  "Hey, we have a drink named after you." And the grasshopper says...
Sydney: You have a drink named Doug?
Vaughn: Well, I was gonna use Phil.

Agent Jack Bristow: [convincing his friend in British intelligence to
  investigate her own agency, thus committing treason] What's a
  little treason between old friends?

Agent Marshall Flinkman: [in a briefing, discussing where the
  exchange of a WMD will take place] Sounds awesome! [everybody
  stares at him] What? Brazil... Isn't that where they have those...
  string... not bikinis... what do you call them?
Agent Jack Bristow: Thongs?

Agent Marshall Flinkman: [attempting to gouge out the eye of a dead
  man to use it for a retinal scan] Ewww. It's oozing.
Agent Jack Bristow: That eye's no good, you'll have to move on to the
  other one. You'll need some kind of a scooping object. Do you have
  a spoon?
Agent Marshall Flinkman: I have a spork.
Agent Jack Bristow: What's a spork?
Agent Marshall Flinkman: It's... like... a combination of a fork and
  a spoon.
Agent Jack Bristow: That'll work.

Rachel Gibson: What happened?
Sark: I overestimated my friendship with Masari. He assumed I was
  betraying him and took the money and left.
Rachel Gibson: Oh. So then he knows you pretty well.

Sark: Wait. If that's the wrong wire...
Rachel Gibson: I thought you liked risks.
Sark: I also like my body. And as I recall, so do you.

Agent Jack Bristow: How was the first briefing with Lauren?
Sydney: [sarcastically] Wonderful.
Agent Jack Bristow: I'm not asking because I'm a fan of inter-office
  gossip. Tell me how it went.

Sydney: What if whatever we're looking for isn't metal?
Agent Jack Bristow: Then we're screwed. Not an unfamiliar situation.

Sydney: I'm writing a paper with soul. It's got lots of soul.


# "Alias" (2001) {A Broken Heart (#1.4)}
Francie Calfo: He has a law review in an hour.
Sydney Bristow: You want to follow him.
Francie Calfo: So much, I cannot even tell you.

Sydney Bristow: And the bank called. Uh, I might have another trip.
Will Tippin: You take an insane amount of trips.

Michael Vaughn: What wife? I have no wife.
Sydney Bristow: No, there was a picture in your office. You and that
  woman. I thought you were married.
Michael Vaughn: No. She and I are not remotely m - You thought I was
  married this whole time?


# "Alias" (2001) {A Dark Turn (#2.17)}
Sydney Bristow: [after getting a call] I have to go in.
Michael Vaughn: Of course you do, it's your day off.

Jack Bristow: Sloane doesn't know that you're in CIA custody.
Irina Derevko: He thinks I'm in hiding, as he is.
Jack Bristow: If Sloane believes you've surfaced, obtained the
  manuscript he's after, he'll want to meet with you. Negotiate a
  purchase.

Sydney Bristow: What is this about? I'd appreciate a little context
  here. You haven't even given me your name.
Counter Intelligence Analyst Mitchell Yaeger: I'm Mitchell Yeager,
  I'm counter-intelligence threat analyst. That should give you a
  little context. I've been sent here to investigate Michael Vaughn.
  It's come to our attention that over the past three months, Mr.
  Vaughn has been in contact with a number of unapproved foreign
  operatives. He's also actively pursued contact with Mr. Pograski,
  who happens to be a former KGB assassin known to have ties with at
  least three terrorist organizations.

Jack Bristow: We may never have a better chance to get Sloane.
  Remember, without Irina's help, the operation in Kashmir would have
  been an embarrassment.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Jack, when the hell did we switch
  places? Derevko could be using this operation just to convince us
  that she's trustworthy.
Jack Bristow: I've had twenty years to reflect on that woman's
  ability to deceive. Trust me. If she lies to me again, I'll know
  it.

Sydney Bristow: Listen to me, there is not a chance that he is a
  traitor, that he would be collaborating with an enemy.
Counter Intelligence Analyst Mitchell Yaeger: You know, I knew your
  mother. About twenty years ago, met her with your father. We used
  to go to a lot of these agency functions, you know. She was, uh,
  charming. Very disarming woman... who wasn't what she seemed.

Sydney Bristow: Weiss, have you seen Vaughn?
Eric Weiss: That's all I am to you... just a conduit to Vaughn. Have
  you ever seen Vaughn and said "Hey, where's Weiss?"

Irina Derevko: I remember the first time you introduced me to Sloane.
  You were both working at the CIA, he came to the house for dinner.
  You were true friends.
Jack Bristow: Yes. We shared a similar unsentimental patriotism...
  and a devotion to our wives. But Sloane changed and... it was
  Rambaldi that did it. I'm not sure what it is... he never told
  me... but Sloane has a personal connection to Rambaldi.
Irina Derevko: I lived for years with the same obsession, to find a
  higher meaning in Rambaldi's work. I never understood how you
  managed to avoid getting caught up in it.
Jack Bristow: I had something neither of you did.
Irina Derevko: Sydney.

Michael Vaughn: Well, 'cause it's common, you know, to dream about
  work, have anxiety over keeping it secret. Especially in the
  beginning.
Will Tippin: Really.
Michael Vaughn: Goes away though.
Will Tippin: What, the excitement?
Michael Vaughn: No. The dreams.

Michael Vaughn: Look, there is something you don't know about me. I
  don't like it when people question my loyalty. It makes me insane.
Sydney Bristow: This isn't about loyalty. I never said anything about
  loyalty.
Michael Vaughn: When you ask me if I'm keeping secrets, the
  suggestion's pretty clear.
Sydney Bristow: And you know what? Secrets will be a problem between
  us. After everything we've been through, you should know that.

Sydney Bristow: Ask yourself, "Would you betray someone you love?"
Counter Intelligence Analyst Mitchell Yaeger: Well I guess we have an
  answer to the intimacy question.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Jack, you make this happen, you can
  have my job.
Jack Bristow: No, thanks

Sydney Bristow: Do you think there's a chance you'll get Sloane?
Irina Derevko: I wanted to see you because... it's going to be
  dangerous, setting this trap. I hope it goes well but there's no
  guarantee. So whatever happens, there's something I need you to
  know. Sydney, I love you.

Irina Derevko: There's one thing. The tracker you put in my shoulder.
Jack Bristow: You want it removed.
Irina Derevko: If they discover I've been tagged, it's over. We both
  know that.

Sydney Bristow: Research? What kind of research?
Michael Vaughn: It's something private. Something just for me.
Sydney Bristow: Who do you think you work for? Nothing is private.
  You're being investigated.

Francie Calfo: [Allison has hypnotized Will] Now I'm going to count
  back from five, and when you wake up, you will remember nothing of
  this conversation. All you will remember is that you had the best
  sex of your life.

Michael Vaughn: I had to find out if she was deceiving us again. I
  mean, I could not sleep at night knowing I was doing nothing. That
  somehow, I was helping her.
Sydney Bristow: And did you find anything?
Michael Vaughn: Nothing. She's clean.

Arvin Sloane: It's good to see you again, Irina.
Irina Derevko: Thank you for extracting me.

Irina Derevko: We need to be up early. [pause] We should get to bed.
Jack Bristow: Yeah we should. [they kiss]


# "Alias" (2001) {A Free Agent (#2.15)}
Sydney Bristow: Vaughn?
Michael Vaughn: How come you never call me Michael?
Sydney Bristow: I call you Michael sometimes. [pause] Vaughn.

Sydney Bristow: I'm graduating today.
Michael Vaughn: What? When the hell did you have time to take a class
  this year?
Sydney Bristow: I wasn't even going to go to the ceremony but... And
  I've been lying here remembering why I never gave school up and why
  I killed myself writing papers instead of... I don't know,
  accepting that I'd be an agent forever.
Michael Vaughn: You're going to quit the CIA, aren't you?

Jack Bristow: [about Kendall] Legally he's right, Ethically he's an
  ass

Sydney Bristow: I'm thinking about leaving the CIA. Which would mean
  giving up my clearance to see you.
Irina Derevko: You're too forgiving, Sydney. Don't pretend I'm
  something I'm not. I've never been a real mother to you and... you
  don't owe me a second chance. If you make this decision about me,
  you're a fool. In fact, if you decide to stay I won't agree to see
  you anymore. Take care of yourself.

Sydney Bristow: [on the phone] Hello?
Arvin Sloane: Congratulations, Sydney. You have so many things to
  celebrate today. I, myself, am still coping with the pain and
  disappointment of learning that you and Jack were double agents.
  The two people I trusted most in the world.

Arvin Sloane: You don't really think it was a coincidence that I
  happened to be away these past two weeks, do you? The intel that
  you acquired that allowed the CIA to take down the Alliance... I
  provided that. My involvement with the Alliance is merely a means
  to an end.
Sydney Bristow: Why are you telling me this?
Arvin Sloane: Because knowing that I'm alive is going to tempt you to
  come after me. Don't. We've helped set each other free, Sydney. And
  as much as I wish you well, I will end your life if you get in my
  way.

Jack Bristow: Simply put, it's the study of geometric objects and how
  they fit together. All Alliance facilities have been raided yet we
  haven't found a single Rambaldi artifact. If Sloane was expecting
  our raid, he could've had everything moved to a secure location. He
  must be using Caplan to help him assemble a Rambaldi device.
Michael Vaughn: So what happens when Sloane puts the pieces together?
Jack Bristow: Whether or not you believe Rambaldi was a prophet, he
  did anticipate technological advances, many of which seem most
  applicable to warfare. It's likely Sloane is building a weapon.

Neil Caplan: I don't understand. Why do you want me? I'm nobody.
Arvin Sloane: You're going to help me put them together because, you
  see, Mr. Caplan, I know that you feel like you're only a hostage
  right now. But I assume you became a scientist to discover what
  secrets the universe has to offer. Believe me, when we're done
  here, you'll be thanking me for giving you the answer. So why don't
  you go ahead and take a look?

Marcus Dixon: How long have you known?
Sydney Bristow: Two years. I wanted to tell you so many times, but I
  was ordered not to. The CIA had no way to verify what I knew in my
  heart was true... that you would never consider working for a man
  like Arvin Sloane.
Marcus Dixon: We were partners. You lied to me, then chose to tell me
  the truth when it was convenient for you. I never want to see you
  again.

Michael Vaughn: [Marshall is offered a job with the real CIA] Hi, I'm
  Michael Vaughn. Welcome to the CIA.
Marshall Flinkman: Uh, yeah I've heard that one before.

Julian Sark: I made contact with our point man. He's assembling a
  team for the bank but I must question your decision to lead them in
  yourself. In spite of your precautions, it's wildly risky, given
  your new level of notoriety.
Arvin Sloane: I'm approaching the finish line of a thirty-year
  odyssey. I won't let anyone else take the final steps for me.

Arvin Sloane: Ah... you must be the man that Sark told me about. The
  man that Sydney was willing to kill me for.
Michael Vaughn: She would have killed you for a lot less.


# "Alias" (2001) {A Higher Echelon (#2.11)}
Sydney Bristow: I have a crush on a guy from work.
Francie Calfo: Really? Who is he?
Sydney Bristow: Someone in my department. We've worked together for
  about a year now.

Jack Bristow: Who's leading the team to recover Marshall?
Arvin Sloane: We've changed his access codes. There is nothing that
  Marshall can tell Cuvee that could possibly hurt us.
Jack Bristow: He will be tortured. Most likely, killed.
Arvin Sloane: Oh yes, I'm sure he will be. I've already contacted
  SD-4. There'll be a replacement in op tech by morning.

Michael Vaughn: Hey, Will. I got your psych report back. You did
  well.
Will Tippin: I'm not a sociopath.
Michael Vaughn: Well, I didn't say that.
Will Tippin: Do I have a job?
Michael Vaughn: Yes.
Will Tippin: A paying job?
Michael Vaughn: Yes. As an analyst. You'll be asked to review
  classified documents and file reports. Think of it as writing
  articles only now your source material is classified. In fact, your
  cover is a journalist.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: just got off the phone with the
  director again and he asked me again if I knew we were in the
  intelligence business.

Irina Derevko: I'll need to send an access code.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: How will we know you're not signaling
  your operation?
Irina Derevko: You won't. [Kendall looks at Jack]
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Do it.

SD-6 OpTech Agent: Someone has launched a denial of server attack on
  us. We're getting pinged over and over. It's slowing down the
  network.
Marcus Dixon: That's odd. They didn't spoof the origin IP. How can
  someone be smart enough to hack in here and forget to cover their
  tracks?

Jack Bristow: Kane called a meeting.
Michael Vaughn: Does she know anything?
Jack Bristow: Unclear. But I'm told she has two units from security
  section prepared to take me in. I have to be ready for anything.

Ariana Kane: Who is Steven Haladki?
Jack Bristow: He was a CIA agent loyal to Irina Derevko.
Ariana Kane: Whom you murdered. We found brain matter in the gun you
  fired on the day Emily was murdered. I admit, I thought DNA tests
  would prove that you killed her but instead they proved you killed
  Haladki.
Jack Bristow: We had reliable intel that Derevko was accessing
  information through the CIA. Her source turned out to be Haladki.
  He was crucial to her operation and had to be removed.

Marcus Dixon: [shouting] Are you ready to party?
Sydney Bristow: Are you ready to party?
Marcus Dixon: I speak nine languages. Techno is not one of them.

Marshall Flinkman: My name is Marshall J. Flinkman, and I'm here to
  rescue you.


# "Alias" (2001) {A Man of His Word (#4.9)}
Sark: Actually, given our shared intimacies with your late wife I'd
  go as far as to say we're family.


# "Alias" (2001) {A Missing Link (#3.4)}
Sydney Bristow: What do you mean? Look there, he's saying... he's
  saying "Jul" or "Julie"...
Jack Bristow: He could be saying any number of things. Sydney, I have
  already subjected this video to the most intense technological
  scrutiny available to the CIA.
Sydney Bristow: Maybe "Julia"...
Jack Bristow: If you want me to do a re-analysis, fine, but you have
  to stop punishing yourself.

Jack Bristow: [to Sydney] When you compelled the NSC to release me
  from prison, you told me you'd done so because... you needed your
  father; that you needed my strength. Twelve months in solitary
  would have an effect on anyone; something that allowed me to stay
  focused was your... strength. Don't lose it now...

Sydney Bristow: Why did the NSC want me in on this?
Lauren Reed: I wanted you... Michael said you were the best.

Jack Bristow: We can assume what they've stolen is a precursor agent
  requiring further synthesis.
Eric Weiss: Okay, does everyone here speak science?
Marshall Flinkman: Yeah.
Eric Weiss: No, Marshall, they don't.

Sydney Bristow: You know, peach isn't really in this season.
Michael Vaughn: I heard peach was the new green.
Sydney Bristow: I thought beige was the new green.
Michael Vaughn: No beige is the new peach.
Sydney Bristow: Okay.

Michael Vaughn: I'm losing the signal.
Eric Weiss: I'm aiming the mike right at her.
Michael Vaughn: I should have worn the ring.
Eric Weiss: Get over yourself. No one aims the mike like I do.

Eric Weiss: It's not an alias she's ever used with us before.
Michael Vaughn: There's no mention of a Julia in her SD-6 files.
Eric Weiss: Right. Which means, last two years, when she was
  supposedly being held by the Covenant...
Michael Vaughn: What? You think she was operational?

Arvin Sloane: [to Lauren] I must admit, I was concerned for you when
  Sydney resurfaced. I remembered seeing her with Vaughn: their
  relationship reminded me my own with my late wife. It was the kind
  of bond that even death cannot sever. Hmmm. Well, apparently I
  misjudged.

Eric Weiss: [talking with Vaughn about Sydney] What ever she just
  did, man, she's good. She is really good.

Michael Vaughn: I've never worked with anyone who can improvise
  better than you can... but when Simon called you Julia... your
  reaction... You didn't seem surprised.
Sydney Bristow: Vaughn...
Michael Vaughn: No. Tell me what's going on. Look, I know we're not
  where we were, but even before then, professionally, we never kept
  secrets from each other. I'm still on your side...
Sydney Bristow: You're right, we're not where we were. And trust me
  when I tell you, I am doing you a favor by keeping you out of it.

Sydney Bristow: I can't afford to make a distinction between
  professional and personal... not in my life. I mean, this job took
  two years from me. Everything is personal.

Jack Bristow: Vaughn's been quizzing me about "Julia". I tried
  shutting down his inquiry, but apparently something you said has
  made that impossible.
Sydney Bristow: All I said was that I couldn't talk about it.
Jack Bristow: Which, of course, has only piqued his interest.

Marshall Flinkman: [holding a machine that could reveal the sex of
  his baby] You know, I could find out right now.
Carrie Bowman: Touch me with that thing and you die.

Sydney Bristow: I thought you said we need to keep this secret!
Jack Bristow: Yes, from the NSC, which is what we've done.
Sydney Bristow: You knew Dixon would order Vaughn to keep this from
  Lauren. If the NSC found out, I'd be pulled.
Jack Bristow: In time, you would have come to the same conclusion.
Sydney Bristow: Maybe, yes, but I wouldn't have acted on it. The last
  thing I want is to be responsible for driving a wedge between
  Vaughn and Lauren.
Jack Bristow: That is a concern I do not share.

Simon Walker: Tell me who the hell you're working for!
Sydney Bristow: I'm working for myself, you son of a bitch!

Lauren Reed: What about my father?
Arvin Sloane: Well, he knew how badly you wanted to become field
  rated, and he thought it was too dangerous, so he made sure it
  didn't happen. But you knew that... didn't you?


# "Alias" (2001) {After Six (#3.13)}
Eric Weiss: [on a CIA meeting] Euro celebrities and children of
  royalty. The kind of people you want to drop-kick.

Jack Bristow: About last week: it was a matter of circumstance,
  Arvin. Whether I would have gone through with it...
Arvin Sloane: Oh, you would've. I would've.
Jack Bristow: Perhaps.
Arvin Sloane: And now you feel guilty. Well don't bother, Jack.
  Sydney's life was at stake. How can I blame a man for doing
  whatever he can to save his daughter's life?

Sydney Bristow: Now that I know what happened to me over the last two
  years, in theory I should finally be able to move on with my life.
Dr. Judy Barnett: "In theory".
Sydney Bristow: The thing is, when I look ahead all I see is Vaughn.

Dr. Judy Barnett: How would you feel if Vaughn left his wife for you?
Sydney Bristow: I don't know. I don't think he would ever leave his
  wife because of me. I mean, I think it would be because he and
  Lauren don't belong together.
Dr. Judy Barnett: Does he belong with you?
Sydney Bristow: Have you ever felt that someone's your soul mate?

Michael Vaughn: What are you talking about?
Eric Weiss: I really don't know.
Michael Vaughn: That's helpful advice.

Michael Vaughn: Do you think you can be in love with two people at
  the same time?
Eric Weiss: No, I don't. However I did have the same intense feelings
  for both Sport and Posh Spice.
Michael Vaughn: Yeah, who didn't?

Julian Sark: Once we eliminate all six cell leaders, we'll travel to
  St. Petersburg to meet with the head of Covenant Operations.
Lauren Reed: Why? To make it easier for him to kill us?

Jack Bristow: You realize it is your prerogative to ask Dixon to send
  someone else.
Sydney Bristow: If Dixon sends me on an operation, I'm going.
Jack Bristow: What I mean is, someone instead of Vaughn.

Toni Cummings: Whether we end up working together or not, do me a
  favor, huh? Don't talk to me about God. What did God intend? Hell
  if I know. Not a clue.

Toni Cummings: And how do two South African rock wranglers hear about
  Chamonix?
Sydney Bristow: The owner was a client.
Toni Cummings: Yeah, I outdid myself on that one. If you're
  interested in a job like that, those stones won't even cover the
  down payment. They barely cover this conversation.

Arvin Sloane: I presume that you treated Sydney and Jack Bristow
  before.
Dr. Judy Barnett: I can't discuss other patients with you.
Arvin Sloane: Then they were your patients?

Sydney Bristow: Every day I wish I could go back in time, but I
  can't. And as much as I... as much as I still have feelings for
  you, I won't be the other woman... not ever.
Michael Vaughn: I know.

Marshall Flinkman: [after get married with Carrie] I love you, Mrs.
  Flinkman!
Carrie Bowman: I'm keeping my name!

Arvin Sloane: [to Barnett] I manipulate people. I'm good at that, and
  I know it. I lie. I keep secrets. I divulge only what I must in
  order to elicit the reaction I need. That skill, in part, is why
  I'm still alive. One of those secrets affects the only two people I
  care about in the world, Sydney and Jack Bristow. There are many
  secrets I enjoy keeping. There is power in secrets that you keep.
  But this one... no. This one wears on me. It has for many years.
  It's central to my very existence. It's who I am.

McKenas Cole: Your hair... that's cool!
Julian Sark: You're the man behind the Covenant.
McKenas Cole: I'm the man in front of The Man. When'd you cut your
  hair?
Julian Sark: It wasn't a matter of choice. I was in US custody, as I
  thought you were. When were you released?
McKenas Cole: That's a good story. [raises his wine glass] To your
  hair.

McKenas Cole: [to Sark] You're cockier than I am. I love that about
  you.

Lauren Reed: [to Sydney] I see what's going on between you and
  Michael, so let me be clear. Stay the hell away from my husband.


# "Alias" (2001) {All the Time in the World (#5.17)}
Agent Jack Bristow: [his very last line of the series] You beat
  death, Sloane... but you couldn't beat me.

Agent Jack Bristow: You beat death Arvin. But you couldn't beat me.

Arvin Sloane: Nadia? I can't move.
Nadia Santos: I don't think there's anything I can do.
Arvin Sloane: I can't move.
Nadia Santos: Well, as you said, you have all the time in the world.
  Unfortunately, I think you'll have to spend it here.
Arvin Sloane: Well, at least you're here with me.
Nadia Santos: No. [She fades away]

Arvin Sloane: You're dying. I can help you.
Agent Jack Bristow: I don't want your help, Arvin. You've caused my
  daughter so much pain. I could've prevented it. I won't make
  continue to make that mistake.
Arvin Sloane: I think you've overestimated your position, Jack. You
  can't hurt me anymore.
Agent Jack Bristow: True. But I can keep you down here with me.

Julian Sark: It's just it's not every day one gets to be a part of
  global genocide.

Sydney Bristow: I thought about that, but I've always thought about
  teaching as my safety net.
Francie Calfo: Teaching's no safety net. You know how dangerous it is
  to be a teacher? Kids bring knives to school these days.

Julian Sark: Did it have to be so filthy? I mean, really, if Rambaldi
  can prophesize the future, he might have advised me not to wear
  $500 shoes.

Arvin Sloane: Nadia, I'm so glad you're here. If I didn't have
  someone to share this with, I may have doubted my own eyes.
Nadia Santos: You're talking to your dead daughter. This is an odd
  time to question your sanity.
Arvin Sloane: Perhaps.

Julian Sark: Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Vaughn, but aren't you
  supposed to be dead?

Sydney Bristow: So that's it. It's the Horizon, isn't it? You shot
  the man I loved. You betrayed my trust. You risked my daughter's
  life, all for that.
Irina Derevko: I don't expect you to understand. We're very
  different, Sydney. You still cling to naive ideals. I learned, at a
  very young age, the only currency worth anything in this world is
  power.
Sydney Bristow: And the Horizon gives you that?
Irina Derevko: You've never seen Rambaldi for what he is. You
  dismissed his work as the labor of a madman. You blind yourself to
  his true potential. I've spent a lifetime acquiring power. With
  this... And I'll never have to give it up. Rambaldi is life,
  Sydney. Eternal life. Through him, we can live forever. I offered
  you an out. I gave you your daughter. I was hoping you'd settle
  down, leave me to my affairs.
Sydney Bristow: You don't know me very well, do you?
Irina Derevko: Sadly, I think I do. After all, I'm still your mother.
Sydney Bristow: That doesn't mean anything. Not anymore. I am through
  being disappointed by you.
Irina Derevko: I hate that it's come to this.
Sydney Bristow: I suppose it had to.
Irina Derevko: I've come too far to let anything get in my way.
Sydney Bristow: Then you'll have to go through me first.

Irina Derevko: I'm afraid I can't allow you to be such a complication
  in my life any longer. For whatever it's worth, I truly do love
  you.

Marcus Dixon: We've already prepared the mission specs - low risk
  incursion, simple alias. Who knows, could be fun.
Sydney: That's what you say every time you show up on my doorstep.
  The next thing you know I'm jumping over canals in three-inch heels
  while napalm explodes around me.
Marcus Dixon: Yes, that's how I define "fun".


# "Alias" (2001) {Almost Thirty Years (#1.22)}
Will: [to Suit and Glasses] One in five, you little bitch! ONE IN
  FIVE!

Jack Bristow: Khasinau knew about the safehouse. He must have someone
  on the inside.
Sydney: I know.
Jack Bristow: As long as there's a mole at the CIA, you can't tell
  Vaughn a thing. Not that you've been contacted, or that you and I
  have spoken.

Marcus Dixon: Marshall, can you remember back to the Aconcagua
  operation? Sydney's code name?
Marshall Flinkman: Miss Bristow? It was, uh, Bluebird.
Marcus Dixon: Bluebird. So it wasn't Freelancer?
Marshall Flinkman: Freelancer? No, no, it was Bluebird. Definitely.

Michael Vaughn: What I said was I feel I have an understanding of
  Sydney Bristow and that she doesn't just accept problems, she tries
  to fix them.
C.I.A. Agent Steven Haladki: And that perhaps Ms. Bristow and her
  father are trying to secure release of Mr. Tippin on their own?

Marcus Dixon: How am I supposed to know what you believe when you've
  been lying to me? I'm your partner!
Sydney: Just think about this for a minute. Just think about
  everything we've been through. Just think about who I am. Now, what
  I am going to ask you to do is just accept the fact that I cannot
  tell you what this is about. What I am doing is classified but
  Dixon... I swear to you that I am not betraying this country. I
  could never do that. You know that!
Marcus Dixon: I don't need rhetoric, Sydney. Right now, I need a
  reason not to report you to security section.

Dr. Zhang Lee: [after whirling a drill in Will's mouth] You had a
  cavity.

Abigail: It's been six days. Will warned me something might happen.
  He didn't even turn up to his own awards dinner. Called his
  friends, they haven't heard from him either. Are you going to
  publish his story?
June Litvack: Yeah. In the "A" section. I have to tell Deitrick that
  this is coming in. Call Orsay in graphics, get a photo of Will.

Sydney: Hi. How did you find me?
Michael Vaughn: You told me a couple of months ago that when you feel
  the need to disappear, you go to the observatory. But the
  observatory was closed. And then I remembered you said the pier
  calms you down. But you weren't there. And you weren't at the
  bluffs and the palisades, either.
Sydney: You didn't really go to all those places.
Michael Vaughn: Yeah, I did. And then I remembered you liked the
  train station, too. Normal people going to their normal jobs.
Sydney: I can't believe you remember that.

Julian Sark: Are you comfortable? Do you feel comfortable trading
  priceless documents for a low-grade reporter?
Jack Bristow: You should read Tippin's stuff. It's not so bad.

Sydney: Wait. I have questions for you.
Alexander Khasinau: You can ask my boss.
Sydney: Your boss? I thought The Man was the boss.
Alexander Khasinau: Yes. Yes, but I am not The Man.
Irina 'The Man' Derevko: [a woman enters and stands in front of
  Sydney] I have waited almost thirty years for this.
Sydney: Mom?


# "Alias" (2001) {Authorized Personnel Only: Part 1 (#4.1)}
Vaughn: Let's go. Nice tits

Yuri Komorov: [opens a suitcase] What is inside can be used for
  good... or evil.
Sydney Bristow: Me too.

CIA Director Hayden Chase: [to Sydney] Even for you, Agent Bristow,
  your arrogance today is appalling!

CIA Director Hayden Chase: I'm recommending to the board that you be
  stripped of classified clearance and assigned to the Dispatch
  Office at Langley.
Sydney Bristow: You're transferring me... to the mail room?

Sydney Bristow: If this is your... decision, Director Chase... I will
  no longer burden this agency with the hazard of my participation.
CIA Director Hayden Chase: Are you opting to terminate your
  association with the CIA?
Sydney Bristow: I will say it in English for you: I quit.

Eric Weiss: [Vaughn is beating a punching bag, obviously angry] The
  bag is dead, I think you can stop now.
Vaughn: Thanks for coming.
Eric Weiss: Thanks for sweating.

Vaughn: Well, you kill your wife after learning she's a vicious,
  homicidal, double agent, and see how rational you are.

Vaughn: I'm leaving.
Eric Weiss: Leaving what... the Agency? Is this because of Sydney?
Vaughn: No, it's not because of Sydney; it's because last year
  sucked.

Sydney Bristow: When I was approached about joining a black-ops unit
  within the CIA, I thought I was doing the right thing. And while I
  appreciate the necessary protocol in assembling a new team, Arvin
  Sloane is not...
CIA Director Hayden Chase: [cutting her off] I understand you used to
  work for Sloane.
Sydney Bristow: Yeah, a criminal psychopath beyond verbal
  descripition...
CIA Director Hayden Chase: I know all about Sloane.
Sydney Bristow: Then allow me to ask the most obvious question in the
  history of time: How can the CIA let that man, who ran what amounts
  to a terrorist cell within the borders of this country, run
  anything?

CIA Director Hayden Chase: But we can use him now: His contacts, his
  expertise, and he will be closely monitored.
Sydney Bristow: I pity the man with that job. [Chase just looks
  pointedly at Sydney]
Sydney Bristow: [realization dawns on her] Wait a minute...
CIA Director Hayden Chase: With you here... Vaughn, Dixon, and your
  father, there's a built-in system of checks and balances. If Sloane
  missteps... you'll catch him. Now, that's it. This is your
  assignment.

Arvin Sloane: Quite frankly I was surprised by their call too, until
  I understood what it is they want: their own SD-6.

Arvin Sloane: You'll need to get him to open the case for you.
Sydney Bristow: Do you have any suggestions?
Arvin Sloane: I assume you'll come up with something interesting.

Sydney Bristow: [to Dixon] One thing makes up for all of this...
  having you as my partner again.

Sydney Bristow: I don't want that, to jump right back in where we
  were, before everything. To pretend like those years didn't happen.
Vaughn: That would be nice, wouldn't it.
Sydney Bristow: But they did.

Kazu Tamazaki: You look familiar.
Vaughn: Sometimes people tell me I look like hockey player, Alexei
  Kovalev.
Kazu Tamazaki: Nah... that's not it.

Vaughn: You want to tell me what happened in Wittenburg?
Sydney Bristow: No, actually, I don't.

Arvin Sloane: [about Nadia] I knew she would be of great value
  here... but she chose to leave intelligence... to drop out.
Sydney Bristow: You sure she really left? Fake-quitting seems to be
  all the rage.

Arvin Sloane: [about Nadia] Because I see in her something I once saw
  in you: the need to work for what's right. And because you know
  what it is to put aside personal issues, and that... that's a gift.
Sydney Bristow: It's not a gift. What it's been is a necessity, and
  it's become a burden, and, quite frankly, something I've run out of
  patience for.

Arvin Sloane: I'm sending you, Sydney. I'll give you the details in
  my office.
Sydney Bristow: Lucky me.


# "Alias" (2001) {Authorized Personnel Only: Part 2 (#4.2)}
Jack Bristow: What you need to do is find a way to accept what's
  happened. If you can deal with Arvin Sloane...
Sydney Bristow: I love that you knew that. That you approved it.
Jack Bristow: It may be hard for you to accept that your father
  doesn't have the authority to...
Sydney Bristow: No, what's hard to accept are the decisions you do
  make. What's hard is looking at you. Walking past you. Smelling
  that sickening cologne. And what's hard is being your daughter and
  not being able to separate myself as far as I may get from the
  person I despise the most.

Marshall Flinkman: The only guy we have left is Sark and that's only
  because he's in custody. I hate that guy, I mean, really, kinda
  scares... although I did go visit him... twice... just to see a
  familiar face. We had eggs.
Eric Weiss: Don't do that.

Marshall Flinkman: [to Dixon] How cool is this? Stealing a sword so
  we can fight a bad guy, you know, in order to catch an even bigger
  bad guy, come on come on you would have never let us do this back
  in the CIA, you know, when you were double breasted serious robot
  Dixon, you...I mean, not that you...you were
  just...authoritative...I'm sorry.

Marshall Flinkman: [to Sydney] Okay, Phoenix, you are hot... and I
  mean that in many ways.

Jack Bristow: Sydney, get in. Get in now... you can be stubborn
  later.

Arvin Sloane: You didn't tell her, did you? The truth?
Jack Bristow: I told her that I was responsible for the death of her
  mother.
Arvin Sloane: Did you tell her everything?
Jack Bristow: She's better off not knowing everything.

Jack Bristow: I'll make you a deal; you cooperate with us... That's
  it.
Large Russian: You don't frighten me.
Jack Bristow: Then, clearly you're an idiot.

Jack Bristow: [Jack and Sydney sit in total silence waiting for a
  contact] This is the best conversation we've had in weeks.

Sydney Bristow: I'm going in. Alone.
Jack Bristow: [on comms] I assume you all heard that...?

Jack Bristow: If she were apprised of the situation, she might help.
Michael Vaughn: I'll make her help; where is she?

Kazu Tamazaki: Before you leave this room, you will tell me why.
Sydney Bristow: I might. I'm relatively open-minded.

Kazu Tamazaki: Have you eaten breakfast?
Sydney Bristow: Why? You want to grab something?

Kazu Tamazaki: You wouldn't be here if you didn't know about the
  contract.
Sydney Bristow: What contract?
Kazu Tamazaki: The contract that I had on your life.

Kazu Tamazaki: The day before the job, my client was killed. Most
  unfortunate. For me.

Sydney Bristow: You were hired to kill me? Who hired you?
Kazu Tamazaki: Sydney... Assassin/Client privilege.

Sydney Bristow: I don't know anything about this.
Kazu Tamazaki: Somehow... I believe you. I guess this was just one of
  those coincidences.
Sydney Bristow: Guess I can just sell you the sword and go home.
Kazu Tamazaki: I'll just take the sword. How's that?

Eric Weiss: [Sydney and Weiss are at Sydney's house] I just... I just
  don't see it, you're working in a bank? What kind of a job is that?
  Cashing checks, making change, "excuse me, next in line please".
Sydney Bristow: I'm a loans officer, I travel, service accounts.
Eric Weiss: Wait a minute, that cover job you had for SD-6?
Sydney Bristow: I happen to be good at it.
Eric Weiss: Great! That's stimulating stuff, watching over someone
  else's money, Syd come on seriously since you left the spy business
  you're a bore!
Sydney Bristow: It's an adjustment it's all... are you sure you don't
  want to stay for dinner?
Eric Weiss: I'd love to, but I've got to go save the world, see you.
Sydney Bristow: Bye. [Weiss goes to the door and opens it, Nadia is
  standing there]
Eric Weiss: Hello.
Nadia Santos: Hi.
Eric Weiss: I'm Eric Weiss, 38, single...
Nadia Santos: Nadia.
Eric Weiss: How are you?
Nadia Santos: Good [turns to Sydney] Is this a bad time?
Sydney Bristow: Not at all Nadia, this is Eric he was just leaving.
Eric Weiss: No, I can stay... [Sydney waves Weiss good bye] or go,
  nice to meet you.

Nadia Santos: I was hoping we could talk about our mother.
Sydney Bristow: Did you bring your passport?

Nadia Santos: And you have no idea who was responsible? Who killed
  her?
Sydney Bristow: [after a pause] No.
Nadia Santos: I swear... somehow I will find out who did this to our
  mother, and I will kill him.

Marshall Flinkman: Syd...Sloane is here.
Sydney Bristow: We know.
Marshall Flinkman: OK. [hugs Sydney] We're back.


# "Alias" (2001) {Blood Ties (#3.20)}
Arvin Sloane: Sydney, whatever grief my apparent death might have
  caused you, I only wish I could have spared you the pain.
Sydney Bristow: When I heard you were dead, any grief I felt was over
  the possibility of never knowing my sister. I did not grieve for
  you.

Arvin Sloane: [to Sydney and Jack] All I want to do is protect my
  child.

Brill: I told you that I worked with your father. But what I didn't
  tell you is I was with him on his final mission.
Michael Vaughn: I know how my father died.
Brill: You don't have a clue.

Brill: He was a follower of Rambaldi.
Michael Vaughn: That's impossible.
Brill: He died protecting the little girl. The followers knew she was
  the Passenger. He broke her out of KGB custody, but he didn't trust
  the CIA either, so he took her somewhere where she would be safe,
  with other followers.

Michael Vaughn: Why did you come to me?
Brill: Because it's what he would want me to do.

Jack Bristow: Sydney, there's something you should know. When I first
  learned of Sloane's affair with your mother, I was forced to
  consider the possibility that I wasn't in fact your biological
  father.
Sydney Bristow: You don't even...
Jack Bristow: It's not the case. I had our medical files examined.
  Our relationship is clear. But I wanted you to know, during that
  brief time before I was reassured my feelings for you never
  changed.

Julian Sark: [to Vaughn] But there are three things that you should
  understand. The first involves this item I hold in my hands. It's
  capable of delivering up to 500,000 volts... not enough to kill
  you, just enough to let you wish it would. The second is I believe
  Mr. Brill disclosed the location of the Passenger, which means I
  won't stop until you tell me. And third, Mr. Vaughn, is that I'm
  going to enjoy this far more than I should.

Julian Sark: I'll ask you again: where is the Passenger?
Michael Vaughn: Holding that thing... you almost look like you've
  reached puberty.

Sydney Bristow: [to Jack] After mom died, I used to have these
  daydreams. I would imagine her leading my girl scout troop or
  taking me shopping for new school clothes. I thought if only she'd
  lived, she would have been my best friend. When I learned the truth
  about her, and saw Irina for who she truly was, I was devastated. I
  won't make the same mistake twice.

Michael Vaughn: Your sister... you have to let her go.
Sydney Bristow: You're tired. I should let you sleep.
Michael Vaughn: No. My father was killed because he took her from the
  KGB. He hid her from your mother. That's why she murdered him... I
  met someone who told me the prophecy. The Passenger and the Chosen
  One shall battle; neither will survive.


# "Alias" (2001) {Blowback (#3.14)}
Lauren Reed: Michael, what are you doing? [Vaughn looks at her phone]
  Sometimes I hate my job. Baby, what's going on?
Michael Vaughn: You know how doctors always make you wait?
Lauren Reed: What?
Michael Vaughn: When you go in for an appointment. My dad hated that.
  He used to say he'd always kept his appointments, and everyone else
  should do the same.
Lauren Reed: You okay?
Michael Vaughn: Yeah. I just... I was looking for my house keys and I
  found this. [shows her the watch]
Lauren Reed: Why? Were you looking for your house keys?
Michael Vaughn: I couldn't sleep. I thought I'd go for a jog.
Lauren Reed: What time is it?
Michael Vaughn: I dunno. It's broken.
Lauren Reed: Are you sure you're all right?
Michael Vaughn: Yeah, I'm fine. [they kiss] I'll see you later.

Eric Weiss: [Sydney, Vaughn and Weiss are seeing a picture of
  Marshall's baby] Will he ever open his eyes?
Marshall Flinkman: Babies sleep, Weiss, that's what they do, you
  know, except when they're screaming. Last night, from midnight to
  six.
Sydney Bristow: He's gorgeous, Marshall.
Marshall Flinkman: Thanks.
Sydney Bristow: Isn't he beautiful?
Michael Vaughn: He has my nose.

Eric Weiss: How are you doing?
Michael Vaughn: Fine.
Eric Weiss: Hey, guess what? It's me. Come on, how're you doing?
Michael Vaughn: I'm hanging in there.
Eric Weiss: How's Lauren about it?
Michael Vaughn: She didn't remember.
Eric Weiss: And, you didn't say anything?
Michael Vaughn: No. I mean, she's got a lot on her mind.
Eric Weiss: Yeah, that's probably it.

Dr. Judy Barnett: Excuse me?
Arvin Sloane: I'm suggesting that we talk over dinner. You know, in
  vino veritas?

Sydney Bristow: [in disguise as an astronomer] Our radio telescopes
  inspect the cosmos looking to detect artificially generated
  signals, basically anything below three hundred hertz. Don't worry,
  the alien invasion is still a few months away.

Sydney Bristow: Is something wrong?
Michael Vaughn: No. I'm just getting old, I guess.
Sydney Bristow: You expect me to believe that?
Michael Vaughn: I've just had a lot on my mind lately, that's all.
  It'll pass.
Sydney Bristow: Yesterday was the day, wasn't it? The anniversary of
  your father's death?
Michael Vaughn: How could you remember that?
Sydney Bristow: I remember what missing him does to you.

Dr. Judy Barnett: It's hard to believe that you threw away something
  that you would normally consider holy.
Arvin Sloane: Are you calling me a liar?

Lauren Reed: This better be good.
Julian Sark: And a good morning to you, too.
Lauren Reed: You paged me on my NSC cell phone. You know that they
  track all incoming numbers.
Julian Sark: This cell phone's been cloned, so you have nothing to
  worry about. We've just learned that a freelance munitions expert
  has created a cutting edge technology, one that he's since sold to
  one of our rivals. We need you to filter back any CIA intel that
  might help us get a lock on it.
Lauren Reed: You called me to remind me to do my job?
Julian Sark: Darling, it's not like that.
Lauren Reed: [sarcastically] Yeah.

Sydney Bristow: [to Lauren] Vaughn and I have a history, a
  complicated one - I can't deny that, but I won't apologize for it
  either. If your marriage is in trouble, if you and Vaughn are
  having problems, I suggest you leave me out of it and take it up
  with your husband.

Lauren Reed: Are you ready for our first job as senior management?
Julian Sark: You're so ambitious, I love it.
Lauren Reed: The job's in Vancouver. Requires a breach of a data
  storage facility.
Julian Sark: Really? What's the prize?
Lauren Reed: A plasma charge. Next generation destructive power.
Julian Sark: I thought those were just theoretical.
Lauren Reed: Apparently not in Vancouver.
Julian Sark: All right. I'll meet you there in four hours.
Lauren Reed: Three. We have to be first in line. The CIA's sending
  agents.
Julian Sark: Who?
Lauren Reed: One guess.
Julian Sark: Sweetheart, this should be fun.
Lauren Reed: I'll see you in Vancouver. Don't be late or call me
  sweetheart.
Julian Sark: Ambitious and domineering. Fantastic.

Julian Sark: It looks like another black mark on your husband's
  record. How's it feel to systematically ruin a man from the inside
  out?
Lauren Reed: It wouldn't be the first time.

Lauren Reed: [Sydney and Vaughn are following to Lauren and Sark]
  They're right behind us.
Julian Sark: Yes, thank you. I can see that.

Lauren Reed: Stop the car!
Julian Sark: What are you talking about?
Lauren Reed: Stop the car, now. Pull in here. [they begin to make
  out]

Julian Sark: Sark: Tell me, did they spot us?
Lauren Reed: No, I don't think so. According to the transport order,
  the ship docks in 16 hours. We should get going.
Julian Sark: You should know that you are amazing. Before, I mean.
  Typically, this is where you return the compliment. [Lauren ignores
  him and gets out of bed]

Dr. Judy Barnett: Are you telling me Sydney is your daughter?
Arvin Sloane: I never tried to prove it, one way or the other. But
  the strength that Sydney finds within, I like to believe that comes
  from me... How about that: the world didn't come to an end.

Julian Sark: [Sark has Sydney as hostage and Vaughn has Lauren as
  hostage, but she is with a mask] Put the gun down, Agent Vaughn.
  Drop the gun.
Michael Vaughn: Not a chance, you drop yours.
Julian Sark: Put the gun down now.
Sydney Bristow: No, Vaughn, don't!
Julian Sark: Drop it. If you love her, you will put the gun down now.
  [Lauren looks at Vaughn]
Sydney Bristow: Vaughn, don't! [Vaughn drops the gun]

Michael Vaughn: Freeze! Give me the bomb. Give it to me. [Sark
  activates the explosive]
Julian Sark: With pleasure.

Lauren Reed: [Lauren and Vaughn are sitting at a bar. Lauren's phone
  rings] Sorry.
Michael Vaughn: It's okay.
Lauren Reed: Hello?
Julian Sark: It killed you, didn't it? Seeing him drop the gun for
  Sydney?
Lauren Reed: No it isn't a good time. Can I call you in the morning?
Julian Sark: He's there with you, is that it? Though he'd rather be
  with her. You know, it's quite a charade you two are engaged in.
Lauren Reed: I think we both know how dedicated I am to this
  assignment. If you have any issues, take it up through the proper
  channels.
Julian Sark: Don't mistake me. It's not your dedication that I
  question.
Lauren Reed: We'll talk about this later. [she hangs up]

Sydney Bristow: I thought you'd be home by now.
Jack Bristow: I was about to say the same to you. The plasma charge,
  it's in our hands.
Sydney Bristow: Sark isn't... the Covenant.
Jack Bristow: Have you had dinner? If memory serves, you always liked
  Mitchellis.
Sydney Bristow: I haven't eaten there since I was eight.
Jack Bristow: I do eat, you know.
Sydney Bristow: I'd like that, actually.


# "Alias" (2001) {Breaking Point (#3.8)}
Lauren Reed: [to Vaughn] He's asked me to go with him: as an observer
  of Sydney's interrogation. Clearly, he's got nothing to hide.

Jack Bristow: We're waiting for Sloane.
Michael Vaughn: You called Sloane on this?
Jack Bristow: You and I will be the prime suspects behind any attempt
  to free Sydney from NSC custody. Sloane has agreed to make it seem
  as if it were the work of the Covenant. Do I trust him on this? Not
  necessarily.

Lauren Reed: But Sydney's made it very clear she doesn't remember
  anything.
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: But when we searched her flat in Rome,
  we found a coded message taped to the underside of her desk. Now,
  if she can decode that message, it may help us infiltrate or even
  take down the Covenant.
Lauren Reed: What if she doesn't recognize the code?
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: As long as she demonstrates a
  willingness to cooperate, that surgery will be nothing more than a
  threat.

Sydney Bristow: You better make sure I'm a vegetable when you're done
  with me...

Lauren Reed: No, I'm sorry, but if I'm going to chronicle our
  treatment of Sydney Bristow, I need to see how she's being treated.
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: How do you suppose it was that Sydney
  Bristow knew to flee the country before she was even aware the NSC
  wanted to take her into custody?

Michael Vaughn: The fact that you're letting me see this place means:
  it's not your only one, is it?
Jack Bristow: You're smarter than you look.

Michael Vaughn: I didn't know you wore glasses.
Jack Bristow: Only during surgery.

Michael Vaughn: [to Jack] You're starting to like me again.

Marshall Flinkman: Forensics guys are monitoring the network.
Michael Vaughn: Isn't there any way to bypass that?
Marshall Flinkman: Of course... it's me, but... [He goes to get
  something] . I give you the codes, you're gonna bust her out,
  aren't you? Kick some NSC booty? Can I just say... love.

Jack Bristow: I've been trying to think of a single reason why you
  saved my life. The only conclusion I've come to is that it would
  incur some feeling of debt on my part.
Arvin Sloane: As usual, Jack, you're in danger of outsmarting
  yourself.

Arvin Sloane: You and Sydney still believe I'm pursuing some hidden
  agenda. Now, whatever you may perceive that agenda to be, clearly
  it would be easier to obtain if you were both dead, given that
  you're my most vocal detractors - my most capable antagonists.
Jack Bristow: Or you need us for something. Something you believe
  only we can provide.

Arvin Sloane: You and Sydney are my absolution, my penance. You're
  all I have left.

Cambell: [to Sydney] Your personality profile reveals your one major
  weakness: empathetic suffering is harder for you to sustain than
  physical torture. So... thanks for caring.

Jack Bristow: [Syd pauses after seeing Sloane in the helicopter] He's
  with us. Get in!

Sydney Bristow: They wanted a code deciphered. That's what all of
  this was about: a code.

Jack Bristow: Thomas Brill, Michael Vaughn.
Michael Vaughn: [nods]
Brill: You Bill Vaughn's kid?
Michael Vaughn: Yeah, he was my father.
Brill: No kidding.


# "Alias" (2001) {Cipher (#2.3)}
Sydney Bristow: I just came from a meeting with Sloane. The camera I
  took from Fordson's vault, the camera we tried to keep from SD-6,
  was an early prototype. The real camera is scheduled to be launched
  into orbit seventy-two hours from now.

Sydney Bristow: You want me to talk to her again.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Mr. Sark has assumed control of your
  mother's operation
Sydney Bristow: Please stop referring to her as my mother.

Dr. Judy Barnett: Well, I'm sorry, but I am not in the habit of
  helping a father manipulate his daughter. No matter how good his
  intentions may be.
Jack Bristow: I see. And is your opinion here based on what's best
  for Sydney, or for the agency? Because the fact is if Sydney
  doesn't talk to Laura, the CIA learns nothing.
Dr. Judy Barnett: So you still think of her as Laura, even though
  that was her alias.

Irina Derevko: Speaking of Ms. Adams... just before I left I remember
  her encouraging you to try out for your school's Thanksgiving play.
  You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but in the twenty
  years since I last saw you I often wondered... what part did you
  play?
Sydney Bristow: I don't remember. It was around the time I was told
  my mother had died. Everything else is a blur.

Sydney Bristow: Seeing her again, I'm realizing there are these gaps
  in my memory from around the time she left. Dad... do you remember
  the Thanksgiving play I was in that year in school? Because I sort
  of do. I mean, I have an impression of it, but I can't remember...
  was I a pilgrim or an indian...? [He stares off] What?
Jack Bristow: You were neither. You were a turkey. You were the only
  turkey that was spared to celebrate the harvest.

Marshall Flinkman: [to Sydney]... if you're stuck in the ducts when
  the rocket launches, then, well, boom. And I'd miss you.

Irina Derevko: You know, you haven't asked me how I could shoot my
  own daughter.
Sydney Bristow: No, I haven't.
Irina Derevko: I assume you wouldn't need this combination so
  urgently if you didn't know where the music box was. Sark won't
  hesitate to kill you. I don't want to lose the chance to explain
  myself someday.

Marcus Dixon: Watch your step. If you fall through the ice, it'll
  freeze over in four seconds.
Sydney Bristow: Good to know.

Julian Sark: It was you giving us problems at the launch. I'd offer
  you passage back to civilization, but my submersible only seats
  four.
Sydney Bristow: It's the thought that counts.

Irina Derevko: [to Jack] There were times when the illusion of our
  marriage was as powerful for me as it was for you.


# "Alias" (2001) {Color Blind (#1.7)}
Jack Bristow: Mr. Vaughn, you're young and you're eager, and I
  understand that. But one thing you're not, and this is something
  only time can provide really, is wise.

Michael Vaughn: Sydney's life is worth the risk!
Jack Bristow: Not to Sydney! Taking them down is what gets her up in
  the morning. Or... did you think it was those meetings she has with
  you?

Will Tippin: She said her name was Kate Jones, but it was really
  Eloise Kurtz. She was my source in the Danny Hecht investigation.
  That means she was more than a source, she was involved somehow!
  She was trying to tell me something, and now she's dead!

Sydney Bristow: The irony is they never lied to me about what would
  happen if I told someone. It was the one thing they said that
  turned out to be true. Now I'm a double agent for the C.I.A. and I
  will be until SD-6 is gone.

Agent Jack Bristow: You pulled my file last week, that's my problem,
  Mr. Vaughn. Now, did curiosity get the better of you, or were you
  trying to impress my daughter?
Vaughn: She thinks you were KGB. But, I'm sure you already knew that.
  So, what I'm wondering is what were you doing checking up on me
  checking up on you?


# "Alias" (2001) {Conscious (#3.9)}
Dr. Brezzel: [about drugs that will hypnotize Sydney] They won't kill
  you. But depending on what they are, your dreams just might.

Sydney Bristow: I suppose I owe you a "thank you."
Arvin Sloane: Sydney, as long as you're alive, you'll never owe me a
  thing.

Arvin Sloane: My foundation gives grants to various researchers. One
  of these men has in development a non-invasive therapy for treating
  long-term severe amnesia.
Sydney Bristow: If this therapy works, why didn't you mention it
  before now?
Arvin Sloane: Well, Sydney, until now I didn't think you'd be willing
  to accept my help.

Lauren Reed: [to Sydney] So, I was an idiot. Michael tried to tell me
  about Lindsey, but I couldn't believe what he was saying. So... so,
  I did what I always do. I followed the rules.

Sydney Bristow: What happens if what we're looking for isn't metal?
Jack Bristow: Then we're screwed; it isn't an unfamiliar situation.

Sydney Bristow: I've been through too much with him; I don't trust
  that man. I still can't believe that you don't feel the same.
Jack Bristow: What I'm feeling is irrelevant. In conspiring to save
  you from the NSC, Sloane's also given us all the ammunition we'd
  ever need to invalidate his pardon agreement. He's put his life in
  our hands.

Sydney Bristow: What are we saying they want?
Arvin Sloane: What about the Rambaldi device?
Sydney Bristow: You'd like that, wouldn't you.
Arvin Sloane: Sydney, I know what you're thinking. Why don't you ask
  yourself, if the device was so valuable to me why did I let it go?
Sydney Bristow: For your freedom. You traded it for your pardon.
  Here's your chance to get it back.

Jack Bristow: Once we make the exchange, the device will be
  destroyed. No one will have it.

Lauren Reed: I know how hard this might be for you... [Sydney punches
  her] .
Sydney Bristow: That was for turning me in to Lindsey.

NSC Director Robert Lindsey: Where's Sydney Bristow? You covered for
  her once, and it cost you your job. Do it again, this cell will be
  your home for the next 10 years.
Marcus Dixon: My lawyer's name is Shelly Bird.
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: Your only play here is to tell where
  Sydney Bristow is and who broke her out. Was it her father?
Marcus Dixon: What I know here is that sending agents to arrest me in
  front of my children is one of the last mistakes you'll ever make
  as Senior Director of the NSC. I've known men like you. Men who
  pretend to be patriots. You are always revealed.

Jack Bristow: I used to think you didn't have much of a spine.
Michael Vaughn: And has that assessment changed?
Jack Bristow: No. [Jack smiles ever so slightly]

Dr. Brezzel: I wasn't expecting you until Tuesday, and, um, uh...
  then I realized that it is, it's Tuesday. You've come to me at a
  really awkward time...

Dr. Brezzel: I don't know anything about you, except that I'm not
  supposed to know anything about you.
Jack Bristow: Suffice to say there are people who are under the
  impression that my daughter has committed a crime. Her memories are
  the only things that can exonerate her.

Dr. Brezzel: Be aware that if you encounter a new memory, it might be
  traumatic.
Sydney Bristow: But it won't necessarily be real.
Dr. Brezzel: Oh, it will be to you.

Sydney Bristow: [On Sydney's dream] You don't have a wedding ring.
Michael Vaughn: I thought we'd go to Santa Barbara first and see how
  that went...
Sydney Bristow: You're not married?
Michael Vaughn: You really hit your head, didn't you?

Michael Vaughn: She was knocked unconscious after the fight. How can
  she remember anything that happened after that?
Dr. Brezzel: Because unconsciously the mind can still establish
  transhistorical accounts of the real world.
Jack Bristow: Meaning even with her eyes closed, her other senses
  were alert?
Dr. Brezzel: Yes, thank you. And based upon those senses, her brain
  will construct an accurate but incomplete memory of the events that
  followed.

Dr. Brezzel: [about Sydney] She's in a tangent.
Kaya: I was in a tangent once.
Jack Bristow: How nice for you.

Dr. Brezzel: She's still in beta, but she's dreaming... that just
  doesn't happen.

Sydney Bristow: I can't help it, I just miss you. I do.
Michael Vaughn: You know we can't do this.
Sydney Bristow: Give me a break, it's a dream... we can do whatever
  we want. At least, I can.

Jack Bristow: Forensic analysis leads Marshall to believe that
  whoever this hand belonged to was alive as recent as four months
  ago.
Sydney Bristow: It couldn't have been Lazarey because I killed him
  last year.
Jack Bristow: Unless, you didn't.

NSC Director Robert Lindsey: I plan on making the trade. During the
  exchange, I want Sydney Bristow taken out.
Arvin Sloane: Ah, I see. She has something on you.

Arvin Sloane: What guarantee do I have that this isn't some form of
  entrapment?
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: Because I know what you're up to, Mr.
  Sloane. I can see your big picture. I know your endgame. I even
  have proof.

Jack Bristow: You're sure the DNA matched Lazarey's?
Lauren Reed: Yes. Which means that Sydney did not kill him... Lindsey
  has nothing on her. She can come home.

Sydney Bristow: [On Sydney's dream] I've never heard of a Saint
  Aidan.
Marcus Dixon: They're hard to find.

Eric Weiss: [On Sydney's dream] Syd, you made it! I hope you're ready
  for an expensive lesson in the art of gambling...
Sydney Bristow: I'm looking for that building.
Eric Weiss: Try the kitchen.

Sydney Bristow: [On Sydney's dream as her double] You think it's an
  accident we don't remember anything?
Sydney Bristow: What happened to me?
Sydney Bristow: [her double] Trust Lazarey.


# "Alias" (2001) {Countdown (#2.20)}
Arvin Sloane: I'm taking a leave. I want you to continue without me.
Julian Sark: Sir, not to belittle your grief, but do not deny
  yourself the victory of a thirty-year pursuit.
Arvin Sloane: If I don't see you again, Mr. Sark, tell Irina that I
  hope you both succeed where I couldn't.

Michael Vaughn: You're saying that five hundred years ago Rambaldi
  drew the DNA profile of a man who's alive today?
Carrie Bowman: It gets even better. Di Regno's DNA profile was a code
  key. It let us decrypt page 94 of the Rambaldi manuscript.
Marcus Dixon: What's on the page?
N.S.A. Deputy Director Brandon: Times and dates, each marking an
  apocalyptic event.

Sydney Bristow: There's a future date listed on the page, isn't
  there?
N.S.A. Deputy Director Brandon: Forty-eight hours from now.
Sydney Bristow: What's the prediction?
Carrie Bowman: The page doesn't say, it just gives the time. It's the
  equivalent of midnight, eastern standard time.

Jack Bristow: I've worked with Agent Dixon for nearly a dozen years.
  You've worked with him for little over a month. If he feels ready
  to be in the field, I'm going to accord him that respect.
Michael Vaughn: But given his state of mind, do you really think he's
  the right person to make that decision?
Jack Bristow: Yes.
Michael Vaughn: Jack, he just lost his wife. I mean, with all due
  respect, why are you fighting with me on this?
Jack Bristow: I'm not required to justify my decisions to you, Agent
  Vaughn. However, I recruited Agent Dixon into SD-6. I'm the man who
  sold him the lie he was working for the CIA. I introduced him to
  the man who killed his wife. I will not be the one to tell him he
  can't assist in Sloane's capture.

Carrie Bowman: Are you gay?
Marshall Flinkman: Why, is there someone you wanted to set me up
  with?
Carrie Bowman: No, it's just every cute guy that I meet turns out to
  be gay.

Sydney Bristow: I need you to look me in the eye and promise me that
  you can handle this.
Marcus Dixon: I promise.
Sydney Bristow: Okay, let's go.

Conrad: [to Sloane] Now you understand. Your journey has just begun.


# "Alias" (2001) {Crossings (#3.12)}
Julian Sark: If I may ask, who is our source of intel at the CIA? And
  how do we know he's reliable?
Mr. Zisman: Mr. Sark, do not burden yourself with unnecessary
  details.

Sydney Bristow: [to Vaughn] Have I offended you in some way, like
  showing up and disrupting the perfect little life you had?

Sydney Bristow: I've done everything I can to try to make this
  ridiculous situation work. You, me and Lauren working in the same
  office...
Michael Vaughn: Yeah, and I have tried to walk around with this fake
  smile on my face, pretending everything was fine, just the way it
  used to be. That's not working for me anymore.
Sydney Bristow: This is it. When we get back, one of us has to go.

Marcus Dixon: I have just been informed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
  that we've been ordered to stand down. Given our tenuous relations
  with North Korea, their official position on Sydney and Vaughn is
  to disavow. Unofficially, I say, "Screw 'em."

Jack Bristow: Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Katya Derevko: What you should ask is what I'll need you to do in
  return for my assistance.
Jack Bristow: I was going to get to that.

Sydney Bristow: I slept with Will.
Michael Vaughn: What?
Sydney Bristow: In Warsaw... we got drunk, and we slept together.
Michael Vaughn: How am I suppose to react to that?
Sydney Bristow: However you want to.

Michael Vaughn: [to Sydney] Bad enough being a fugitive in North
  Korea. Now I have to find out that you slept with Will?

Julian Sark: [posing like a CIA's agent] Well I assure you, the
  United States will be happy to have you.
Leonid Lisenker: Yes. The Covenant must be stopped. What they are
  planning... keeps me awake at night.

Jack Bristow: Tell me, which of Irina's sisters are you? Elena or
  Ekatarina?
Katya Derevko: I haven't been Ekatarina since I was a child. My
  sisters call me Katya. Which means Irina wasn't the one who told
  you about me.
Jack Bristow: Learning that your wife is actually a Russian spy
  drives you to learn all you can about her true identity.

Katya Derevko: As observant as you are, you were married to my sister
  for five years without suspecting who she really was: her love must
  have been intoxicating.

Arvin Sloane: I remember years ago, I was working at SD-6. I was on
  my way to a meeting in Berlin. It was a typical day... except
  K-Directorate made an attempt on my life. As I opened my car door,
  a sniper shot came out of nowhere. The bullet grazed my neck.
  Actually left a burn mark... You never forget what that feels
  like... to barely escape with your life.
Jack Bristow: I have a plane waiting.
Arvin Sloane: Then you should go.

Michael Vaughn: We're not gonna make it out of here. There's
  something I need you to know.
Sydney Bristow: Vaughn...
Michael Vaughn: In my life, there's only one person...
Sydney Bristow: Don't do this.
Michael Vaughn: Look at me.
Sydney Bristow: Vaughn...
Michael Vaughn: The only reason I pushed you away...
Sydney Bristow: Please...
Michael Vaughn: The only reason I didn't know how to be around you...
  [hear marching]
Sydney Bristow: They're coming.
Michael Vaughn: Sydney...
Sydney Bristow: I know, Vaughn. I know. We'll find each other. We
  always find each other.

Jack Bristow: You warned him, didn't you? Sloane. Whatever trust I'd
  established with him over the past few months has been compromised.
  What I can't figure out is, how will this play to Irina's
  advantage? Or your own?
Katya Derevko: One day when you least expect it, Irina's intentions
  will present themselves to you. And when that day comes, I promise
  you - it will be unmistakable.


# "Alias" (2001) {Dead Drop (#2.4)}
Michael Vaughn: Well, maybe so, but I certainly didn't join the CIA
  looking for fairness! After everything she's done to you, are those
  things you could ever forgive?
Sydney Bristow: I don't know.
Michael Vaughn: Yeah, well, your father doesn't share that ambiguity.
  He's meeting with Assistant Director Kendall right now and he is
  lobbying to have your mother taken away.

Jack Bristow: There's another fact! Nothing that woman says or does
  can be taken at face value. Her motivations are strictly her own
  and now that your dealings with your mother have taken on an
  emotional component, I'm concerned.
Sydney Bristow: Well, don't be. I'm more professional than that.
  Every one of our discussions has been specific and mission-related.
Jack Bristow: You told her about your school play.

Sydney Bristow: Dad, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not that
  naive.
Jack Bristow: I'm sure that's something we both hope is true.

Will Tippin: Well, I've got four weeks left of community service and
  then I'm done. Hey, um, you remember last week when I cooperated
  and let the CIA hypnotize me?
Sydney Bristow: Yeah.
Will Tippin: What happened with that? I mean, was I helpful at all?
  And I'm only asking because about five minutes ago I was doing
  pretty well as a reporter, you know, and now I'm a dishwasher
  living in denial. That's all.
Sydney Bristow: The information you provided was huge. [Sydney's
  pager goes off]
Will Tippin: Good guys or bad guys?
Sydney Bristow: Neither. My father.

Jack Bristow: Irina Derevko gave you the operations manual for her
  syndicate. I would like you to tell me where you've hidden it.
Claus Richter: Derevko is a great woman.
Jack Bristow: Morphine's not bad, either. Let me be clear. I've only
  given you enough to last five minutes. Cooperate and get all you
  want. Resist and you get none.

Rebecca Martinez: I know who you are, Will Tippin. I read your
  articles. The reporter with the big imagination who fell in love
  with the heroin chic lifestyle.
Will Tippin: Yeah. Yeah, that's me.
Rebecca Martinez: My theory? I don't think you ever really were a
  drug addict.

Julian Sark: Would you consider working for me if it meant I'd let
  you walk out of here? I believe if you took the time to hear a
  offer, you might actually say yes.
Sydney Bristow: You're cute, but I'll pass.

Irina Derevko: How do you say "thank you" to the woman who killed
  your father?
Michael Vaughn: [pause] You don't.

Jack Bristow: You asked me what I was afraid of. I can tell you, it's
  obvious. I'm afraid of losing my daughter.

Sydney Bristow: Sark is like the good-looking guy in high school who
  knows how cute he is and won't take "no" for an answer.

Sydney Bristow: [returning her mother's earrings] They've been
  checked for hidden compartments, transmitters, passive sensors.
  Every sharp edge has been dulled.
Irina Derevko: I was twenty-one years old when I was given these at
  the graduation from the academy. My mother,your grandmother, put
  these in my hands. I cried. She said: "Sweetheart, wear them well".
  You would have liked her. Had things... been different.

Rebecca Martinez: Will Tippin shouldn't be a problem. I gave him a
  number of opportunities, all recorded on audio files, to restart
  his SD-6 investigation. Tippin never took the bait.
Arvin Sloane: Has Security Section seen that?
Rebecca Martinez: Yes, and they're classifying Tippin as a
  non-threat.

Sydney: Sark is like the good looking kid in high school. He knows
  how cute he is and wouldn't take no for an answer.


# "Alias" (2001) {Doppelganger (#1.5)}
Francie Calfo: Okay, so I'm in my Operations and Technology
  Management class, and I realize two things. One, I prepared the
  wrong chapter.
Sydney Bristow: No!
Francie Calfo: I don't want to talk about it. And two, you and I are
  going to have a Halloween party.

Sydney Bristow: How am I supposed to make a double switch invisible
  to my partner? He'll be there.
Michael Vaughn: You cannot tell him the truth. I mean, he might
  already know who he's working for.

Francie Calfo: So, what's going on with work? You always talk about
  work and you haven't even mentioned it today.
Will Tippin: I wasn't working on a S.A.T. story. When I bumped into
  you guys? There is no S.A.T. story. I was trying to track down a
  woman named Kate Jones. She was supposed to be seated next to Danny
  on a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong.

Marcus Dixon: Sloane is asking about Berlin. He thinks someone might
  have gotten to Schiller. He thinks he might be a plant. He wanted
  to know why you had me change the pick up to Koenig Strasse.
Sydney Bristow: I told you, I thought I was being followed.
Marcus Dixon: Syd, is there something I should know?
Sydney Bristow: No.

Sydney Bristow: He practically apologized.
Michael Vaughn: Sloane did?
Sydney Bristow: For thinking maybe I'd mailed him the wrong guy.
  Imagine that.


# "Alias" (2001) {Double Agent (#2.14)}
Sydney Bristow: About last night...
Michael Vaughn: Is this going to be about Alice?
Sydney Bristow: I know it's complicated...
Michael Vaughn: We're not together anymore.
Sydney Bristow: Since when?
Michael Vaughn: Since this morning. The truth is, we've been over for
  a long time.

Sydney Bristow: I was thinking... I can actually go to the CIA
  through the front door.
Michael Vaughn: And I can actually give you a ride.

C.I.A. Agent James L. Lennox: I could've sworn you were a blonde.
Sydney Bristow: I was. My hair's usually brown. Hard to keep track.

C.I.A. Agent James L. Lennox: Emma used to say that she had spent so
  much of her life pretending to be other people that she was afraid
  she might disappear. And I have been sitting here trying to
  remember all her aliases and you're right. It's hard to keep track.
Sydney Bristow: I lost my fiance last year and I know we're trained
  to compartmentalize things that hurt too much but I still haven't
  been able to do that. As hard as it is, I would rather feel it than
  to not feel anything.

Jack Bristow: We've decrypted the specs on Project Helix that you and
  Vaughn obtained. The data describes a breakthrough in
  next-generation molecular gene therapy. It refers to a new
  procedure whereby a patient's face and body are reshaped to
  identically resemble someone else. Agent Lennox was the first test
  subject to be doubled.

Sydney Bristow: How is this possible without obvious scarring?
Jack Bristow: The procedure isn't surgical. A patient's genetic code
  is altered to reshape their physical attributes.
Sydney Bristow: Is it reversible?
Jack Bristow: It's unclear. It only works on people of a certain
  genetic disposition and the recipient must be induced into a
  comatose state for several days while their cells regenerate. The
  data indicates the only way to distinguish the real person from the
  double is by an ocular scan. A flaw in the iris was deliberately
  built into the procedure to tell them apart.

C.I.A. Agent James L. Lennox: I'm not the only one who's been
  doubled.
Sydney Bristow: Who else?
C.I.A. Agent James L. Lennox: It doesn't say.

Sydney Bristow: [to Lennox] One thing about my fiance... I was lucky
  to have known him for as long as I did.

Michael Vaughn: You're so beautiful.
Sydney Bristow: [after Vaughn kisses her] Dinner's ready.
Michael Vaughn: You do have an oven you know, we can reheat.

Eric Weiss: So, in a case like this, we start by digitizing all the
  news coverage that covered the bombing. You, uh, you like Italian
  food?
Christine Phillips: I have a boyfriend.
Eric Weiss: [Weiss looks up as Vaughn walks in the room] Yeah, me
  too.


# "Alias" (2001) {Endgame (#2.19)}
Irina Derevko: This plan might not hold up. The CIA knows too much:
  they could guess why we were after the genetic database.
Arvin Sloane: I'm not interested in the database. I want satellite
  footage of Tuscany. I want to know who murdered my wife.
Irina Derevko: We both had to make sacrifices, Arvin. You won't
  forgive yourself if you stop now. We're so close to knowing what
  Rambaldi knew.
Arvin Sloane: I wish I never heard that man's name.

Sydney Bristow: Look at this: Elsa Caplan's debrief transcript. It's
  barely ten pages long. Sloane kidnapped her husband two months ago
  and all we have is ten pages?
Jack Bristow: Sydney, if you feel Elsa Caplan was improperly
  debriefed, do it again yourself.

Irina Derevko: We still need your help. I just downloaded this.
  That's a catalog of over ten million people's DNA. We're looking
  for someone specific, a man. But it's encrypted. We need you to
  break it.
Neil Caplan: For the past two months I haven't heard a word about my
  family or been given any indication whether they're dead or alive.
  So you can just kill me. Just kill me because there's no way in
  hell I'm going to help you people anymore.

Sydney Bristow: Vaughn. I mean, okay. The backpack is getting a
  little ridiculous.
Michael Vaughn: What do you mean?
Sydney Bristow: [She points to her bureau] The middle drawer. It's
  yours.

Michael Vaughn: [after Sydney gives him his drawer] I love my drawer!

Sydney Bristow: Your husband might have been working for the Russian
  SVR. It's their equivalent to the CIA.
Elsa Caplan: What did the fax say?
Sydney Bristow: A single Russian word. "Razvyaska". It means
  "endgame".
Elsa Caplan: [starts to cry] Neil's gonna die.

Elsa Caplan: I just committed treason against my government because I
  want to get him back. I'm telling you because I love him.

Jack Bristow: Yes, Vaughn briefed me. Elsa Caplan shouldn't be
  processed as a walk-in, she's an SVR agent.
Sydney Bristow: Which means we can classify her as a defector.
Jack Bristow: Or we can arraign her and try her for espionage. Until
  we make that determination, I'm holding her here.

Jack Bristow: I'm not willing to risk your life based on speculative
  intel you acquired from a Russian spy.
Sydney Bristow: Why would she lie?
Jack Bristow: That's precisely the question!
Sydney Bristow: She turned herself in!
Jack Bristow: She's not the first!

Eric Weiss: [talking about Sydney] So she gave you a drawer, huh?
Michael Vaughn: It was a gesture of convenience.
Eric Weiss: And, uh, what did you put it in?
Michael Vaughn: Why do you care?
Eric Weiss: What do you mean, why do I care? Do you know how spoiled
  you are? You know, a drawer! I wish I had a girlfriend to say 'Hey,
  do you want a drawer?'
Michael Vaughn: I'll give you a drawer at my place.
Eric Weiss: I don't want a drawer at your place.

Jack Bristow: [to Vaughn] And, just because you have gotten
  comfortable with my daughter doesn't mean you can get comfortable
  with me.

Eric Weiss: Jack is going to shoot you in the face.
Michael Vaughn: Just give me a half-hour head start. Tell him that
  she called your phone and you gave it to me. We only have ten hours
  to find Kaplan.
Eric Weiss: If we end up sharing a cell in federal prison, I'm not
  giving you a drawer.

Julian Sark: I'm like anyone, Mr. Caplan. What I want is that which I
  never had.

Sydney Bristow: You're NSA?
Neil Caplan: They recruited me out of Caltech. Even though, if you
  ask them, they'll deny any affiliation with me. I knew Elsa was a
  spy the day we met.
Sydney Bristow: Okay, look, your wife injected you with a cyanide
  caplet. We have to remove it right now!
Neil Caplan: What?

Sydney Bristow: We downloaded the DNA database Caplan decrypted from
  the computer he was working on. We finally have a lead on Sloane
  and Derevko.
Jack Bristow: Good. But, Sydney, if you go around me again I'll have
  you transferred and finding them will no longer be part of your job
  description.


# "Alias" (2001) {Facade (#3.15)}
Jack Bristow: Actually, Ryan alerted local authorities, gave them
  time to evacuate the building.
Eric Weiss: So he's a humanitarian bomber?

Michael Vaughn: He wanted the bomb squad called in?
Marshall Flinkman: Well, maybe because he knew there was nothing they
  could do.

Eric Weiss: What, I can't ask my buddy...
Michael Vaughn: [angrily] The marriage is fantastic.
Eric Weiss: [Vaughn leaves in a huff] Yeah, I can tell.

Eric Weiss: That was good, right? It's called method acting: I was
  shot in the neck once... I can do it again.

Michael Vaughn: I still think it would just be easier to sic your
  father on him.
Sydney Bristow: We have twenty-seven hours before Ryan sets off
  another bomb. Our best chance to prevent that is to let him know
  that his first demonstration convinced us to buy every weapon he
  can produce.
Michael Vaughn: Us, being the Covenant, based on intel received from
  someone we may or may not be able to trust.

Sydney Bristow: Your product demonstration in Belfast was impressive:
  we'd like to purchase your new weapon.
Daniel Ryan: Yeah. While I appreciate... your hairstyle... as I said,
  I do business with Andrejev.

Daniel Ryan: [to Sydney] There's loads of things I'm really good at.
  Some, I'm exceptional at. One of them is poker. Ahh, I love poker.
  Play twice a week. My friends come 'round, they bring their money,
  they lose their money. I always win. Do you know why? I can see a
  bluff a mile away.

Leonid Lisenker: Daniel, I know about Belfast. Your extraction was
  cleared to the highest levels. Emma saved your life. You should
  kiss her... whatever she wants.

Leonid Lisenker: Sark has never met Ryan.
Jack Bristow: Are you sure of this?
Leonid Lisenker: Yes.
Sydney Bristow: That wasn't a "yes," that was a "no."

Julian Sark: Doesn't it bother you?
Michael Vaughn: What's that?
Julian Sark: A bombmaker arranges for a meeting on a plane and then
  doesn't show up. I don't know about you, but that concerns me.

Marshall Flinkman: Okay, first of all, I didn't touch anything, I
  swear! But the bomb's been activated!
Jack Bristow: We know. We just spoke to Vaughn.
Marshall Flinkman: No, not on the plane, in my office! The bomb in my
  office has been activated!

Daniel Ryan: Don't tell me. We've come to the point where you coerce
  me into cooperating.
Jack Bristow: Not exactly. [Jack grabs Ryan by the neck and starts to
  strangle him]

Jack Bristow: [to Ryan] There's no white light. Not for people like
  you.


# "Alias" (2001) {Firebomb (#2.16)}
Sydney Bristow: The CIA has a hit list, 35 people world-wide that
  agents are allowed to kill. 35 out of 6 billion. You're one of
  them, which means when I kill you I won't even be breaking the law.

Arvin Sloane: This is bigger than SD-6. Bigger than the CIA.

Michael Vaughn: [Sydney and Vaughn walk into Syd's apartment,
  Vaughn's cell phone rings] Hello?
Eric Weiss: Hey, Kendall has something he wants to show you.
Michael Vaughn: Ah, can it wait?
Eric Weiss: Apparently not, he wants to Sydney too. Are you with her?
Michael Vaughn: Ah, no. I haven't seen her.
Eric Weiss: You're in bed with her right now, aren't you?
Michael Vaughn: Trying. Just find out what he wants.

Will Tippin: But in the hell-hath-no-fury department, I figure this
  woman would pay us to mess with her ex.

Francie Calfo: You know, Sydney, you've been acting sort of weird
  lately. Sydney:
Sydney Bristow: Really? I thought you'd been acting weird. I thought
  maybe it was because of Will.
Francie Calfo: You don't talk to me anymore.
Sydney Bristow: I'm sorry, Francie. I just get so caught up in work.
Francie Calfo: Don't forget. We used to be really good friends. You
  can talk to me.

Eric Weiss: We just had an Echelon intercept. Key words were picked
  up: "terrorist", "weapons of mass destruction". But you ready for
  this? "Rambaldi".
Michael Vaughn: Did you get coordinates?
Eric Weiss: Yeah. Yours. We don't know what's happening but you're
  not waiting for us to find out. Get out now!

Michael Vaughn: You said everyone in the radius was affected, even
  people who were taking cover?
Marshall Flinkman: Yeah. Well, there's no defense against this kind
  of energy. It goes through walls, concrete, steel, everything.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: There's no shield.
Marshall Flinkman: No. Sorry. Oh, um, I should probably also tell you
  that, um, this kind of energy knocks out computer circuitry. Which
  means if it's pointed at the sky, it could take down planes.

Marcus Dixon: I'm out.
Michael Vaughn: Sydney's in trouble.
Marcus Dixon: Respect my decision.
Michael Vaughn: I can't do that. Not when your decision may cost
  Sydney her life. You wouldn't tell Sydney how you infiltrated
  Kabir's so she found an alternate way in using what turned out to
  be faulty intel. She was captured and unless we find another
  confirmed access point, no one will be sent in to get her out.

Marcus Dixon: [to Sydney] I can't judge you for not telling me about
  SD-6.

Sydney Bristow: [to Vaughn] What we saw, in the church. Every time we
  think we've seen the worst...

Julian Sark: [to Sloane] You talk of power and control. But when you
  create a completely powerful weapon, you leave it in the hands of a
  complete stranger.


# "Alias" (2001) {Full Disclosure (#3.11)}
Sydney Bristow: You're part of this?
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Well, that all depends on which part
  you're referring to.
Sydney Bristow: You're Covenant.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: No, no, no. That wouldn't go over too
  well at home.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: We need to talk about the past two
  years.
Sydney Bristow: As you may be aware, Mr. Kendall, I have no
  recollection of that time.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: But I do.

Sydney Bristow: You've known all this time...
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Yep.
Sydney Bristow: Then why haven't you said anything?
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Because you asked me not to.

Oleg: [to Sydney] The sooner you accept that you are no longer who
  you were, the easier this will be. Sydney Bristow... is gone.

Oleg: [trying to brainwash Sydney] Your name is Julia Thorne. You
  were born in London on August 2, 1973.
Sydney Bristow: My name is Sydney Bristow, you ugly bastard.

Oleg: Your name is Julia Thorne.
Sydney Bristow: Really? Then why is my name Sydney Bristow?

Oleg: You lost your family in a fire... You were the only survivor...
  After that, you became a contract killer... You showed no pity.
  Your first targets were the men who destroyed your family...

McKenas Cole: [to Sydney] Who this man is, is not important. What is
  important is this knife on the table. Use it. Kill this unimportant
  man.

Sydney Bristow: I want to go home. I want to see my dad.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Your father can't be contacted; he's
  under deep cover. And as it is, you have no home to return to.
  Agent Bristow, let me be clear: you return home, you're putting in
  jeopardy the lives of the people you claim to love.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: It is imperative that you continue as
  Julia Thorne - The Covenant believes they have you programmed.
Sydney Bristow: If you think I'm going back to them, you're insane.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: If you don't, they're going to come
  after you. After your friends, your family... after Vaughn.

Sydney Bristow: [about Vaughn] I have to see him.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Sydney, you've been gone for nine
  months.
Sydney Bristow: [putting on her coat] He loves me. Nine months is
  nothing.

Sydney Bristow: I've never heard of Project Blackhole.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Thank you.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: The Covenant believes Rambaldi's
  prophecies. They believe a lot of things... including the idea that
  you are the Chosen One.

Sydney Bristow: I've seen too much... Everything gets stolen.

Sydney Bristow: Can you locate the cube?
Marshall Flinkman: Well, no, not exactly, but I can narrow it down to
  a ten-yard radius.
Sydney Bristow: [happily relieved] Marshall, that's called locating
  it.

Marcus Dixon: The day you showed up in Rome... when you called in...
  they put you through to Kendall? I was there that day, in the
  office. When he hung up, he told me that it was you. Sydney, I've
  known the truth about what happened to you, and I was ordered to
  say nothing.
Sydney Bristow: Dixon, we've been working together for months.
Marcus Dixon: It's not easy, is it. Keeping the truth from someone
  you love. Now I have an idea what it was like for you at SD-6.
Sydney Bristow: You're coming with us?
Marcus Dixon: Of course I am; it's personal for me too.

Marcus Dixon: [to Sydney] Kendall wants all of this brought back for
  analysis... Do your thing.


# "Alias" (2001) {Hourglass (#3.19)}
Agent Jack Bristow: In April '75 in Saigon, you toasted Sydney's
  birth with a bottle of Chambertin Clos de Bez. Your favorite. Now
  that I know you have a daughter, I thought I should return the
  honor, especially considering they share the same mother
Sloane: Irina betrayed both of us Jack. She sought me out for
  information the same way she did you.
Agent Jack Bristow: She was my wife
Sloane: She was a KGB spy who cared nothing about you or me. I've
  always thought that you understood your relationship with Irina was
  nothing more than that. But now that your schoolboy crush on the
  woman who destroyed your life is preventing you from saving mine, I
  will have to revise that assessment.

Conrad: I cannot help you, Mr. Sark.
Julian Sark: How do you know my name?

Sydney Bristow: We should talk to Dixon and figure out a way to
  handle this.
Michael Vaughn: Oh, I know how to handle this.
Agent Jack Bristow: You will act like nothing has changed.
Michael Vaughn: Okay, what's Plan B 'cause that's not going to
  happen.

Michael Vaughn: My wife betrayed me. She betrayed all of us. You
  can't expect me to pretend that never happened.
Agent Jack Bristow: I'm not sure you have a choice.
Michael Vaughn: Why is that?
Agent Jack Bristow: Because you're the one that married her.

Sydney Bristow: [watching Vaughn with Lauren] After thirty years you
  still live with your wife's betrayal. Will he?
Agent Jack Bristow: Absolutely.

Sydney Bristow: Before he died, he told me my mother was not the
  Passenger. He said my sister was.
Agent Jack Bristow: Who was this man?
Sydney Bristow: A monk, a cleric, a Rambaldi scholar... what
  difference does it make? Do I have a sister?

Sloane: I have seventy-two hours to live. I want you to focus on
  that, not on some affair I had twenty-five years ago.
Sydney Bristow: I'm not focusing on the affair. I'm focusing on the
  child that resulted from it: a sister I never knew I had.
Sloane: Must have come as a shock to you. It did to me when I found
  out.
Sydney Bristow: Are you telling me you didn't know?
Sloane: No, not until two years ago, while I was in a monastery in
  Nepal run by followers of Rambaldi.

Sydney Bristow: You know she is The Passenger.
Sloane: [tearfully] I know. I know. I also know the Covenant is after
  her. Sydney, I want to protect my child.

Marshall Flinkman: [to Vaughn] She is good. If you had to fall in
  love with someone who's evil, I would see why it'd be her.

Michael Vaughn: How are you?
Olivia Reed: I'm doing surprisingly well for a pariah. I never liked
  politics. You never know who your friends are. At least now that
  I'm the wife of a traitor, I know the answer. I have none.

Sydney Bristow: If Sloane dies, any chance I have of finding my
  sister dies with him.
Agent Jack Bristow: Has it occurred to you that your half-sister
  might be a danger to you?
Sydney Bristow: Yes of course. But it's equally possible that I can
  help her. She could be an innocent victim.
Agent Jack Bristow: With Irina Derevko and Arvin Sloane as her
  parents, I don't think so.

Michael Vaughn: Listen, about what happened in Richmond...
Sydney Bristow: You were doing your job. And she is your wife.
Michael Vaughn: Not for long.

Agent Jack Bristow: You're right. I'm not going to help you. Since
  this is the last conversation we will ever have, I want to make
  this perfectly clear. What you have done to my daughter is nothing
  compared to what I will do when I find yours. Salut.

Sloane: For you who pay witness, I can only believe there is a common
  thought amongst you all: "This is as it should be." I do not
  disagree. My only request: that if my daughter is in fact found
  alive, that she understand my actions, she understand that this
  day's events are the net result of her father's passion to find
  her, to know her, to love her.

Lauren Reed: Sloane is dead. We can now locate the Passenger without
  his interference.
Olivia Reed: Not quite. The code key you retrieved from the CIA is
  unusable; I can only assume that was deliberate on their part.
  Vaughn played you. He's likely to try again, but that will be his
  last mistake.


# "Alias" (2001) {Ice (#4.4)}
Weiss: Killed? He exploded like a frozen pinata.

Derek Modell: My bird is missing.
Weiss: It's "I've lost my canary".

Michael Vaughn: [to Sydney] It's not everyday you see a guy shatter
  into a million pieces.

Arvin Sloane: He believed that Ice 5 was being covertly developed
  there by a man named Fenton Keene.
Marcus Dixon: Haven't heard that name in a while.
Arvin Sloane: That's because Mr. Keene claims to have gone
  legitimate.
Sydney Bristow: Seems to be all the rage among evil geniuses.

Jack Bristow: Is something on your mind Agent Vaughn.
Michael Vaughn: [hesitant] No, not really. I'm not very sleeping
  well.
Jack Bristow: It's Lauren, isn't it.
Michael Vaughn: I think I see her sometimes; I thought I saw her in
  the market in Algeria. Did that ever happen with you?
Jack Bristow: Do I have visions of Lauren?
Michael Vaughn: I don't know that many people who killed the woman
  they were married to. I was just wondering if that's what happens.
Jack Bristow: It did, now it doesn't.

Michael Vaughn: Besides, it'll give you a chance to brush up on some
  of your old-school tricks.
Marcus Dixon: [with a laugh] Hey... a little respect for your elders.

Kiera MacLaine: It's a pretty nasty cut. Mind telling me how you got
  it?
Michael Vaughn: [disguised as a priest] Someone didn't like my last
  sermon.

Michael Vaughn: When's the last time you went to confession, Kiera
  MacLaine?
Kiera MacLaine: ...I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel.
Michael Vaughn: About what?
Kiera MacLaine: A flirty priest.
Michael Vaughn: I assure you my intentions are honorable... mostly.

Fintan Keene: You should be nicer to your big brother. [to Vaughn]
  Isn't that what the Bible says?
Michael Vaughn: Why, do I look like some kind of expert?

Michael Vaughn: I do this for a living... not the drinking.

Michael Vaughn: I was married for a short time... The woman I was
  married to betrayed me, she betrayed alot of people. And when I
  found out what she'd done I let my hate for her consume me, I began
  to wish the woman I loved was dead. I woke up every day imagining
  how I'd do it, what was the best way, what was the most efficient
  way. It's all I wanted. That woman was evil and deserved to be
  punished and so I killed her. And although that woman was the worst
  kind of evil I also know that killing her was wrong. I don't sleep
  much, I can't. I can't close my eyes without seeing it, that
  moment, the look on her face. She won't leave me. She won't.

Kiera MacLaine: [to Vaughn] Forgiveness is a tricky thing, isn't it?

Michael Vaughn: There are other ways to keep him from having power
  over you, to make him go away.
Kiera MacLaine: You underestimate my brother.
Michael Vaughn: Or maybe you underestimate me.

Fintan Keene: [to Vaughn] My sister may look like an angel but her
  heart is as black as yours and mine.

Jack Bristow: [to Nadia] Irina told me years ago that this is a
  picture of her holding her niece. She told me that holding this
  baby filled her with a longing and a hope to have children of her
  own. The next day I asked Irina to marry me; I wanted my child to
  be loved like the baby in this photograph. Of course, her story
  could have been a total fabrication, another one of her countless
  lies designed to draw me in. But I choose to believe it was truth.
  When we had Sydney, Irina held her in this exact same way, and I
  can only imagine that she did the same with you. So for me, I
  choose to believe. But than I suppose each of us needs to find out
  own sense of closure.


# "Alias" (2001) {Legacy (#3.21)}
Sydney Bristow: [about Sloane] He's never divulged the specifics of
  this message, but he was willing to risk everything... his wealth,
  his legitimacy, even his life... to acquire it. This is his
  endgame. We have to believe that he will kill Nadia in pursuit of
  it.

Arvin Sloane: I don't want to hurt you.
Nadia Santos: Then why are you doing this?
Arvin Sloane: When Abraham was asked to take his only child, Isaac,
  and offer him up to God, he didn't hesitate. And he took in his
  hand the fire and the knife, and it was only then, that the angel
  came. But Abraham had to be willing to make this unbearable choice.
Nadia Santos: I understand.
Arvin Sloane: You do?
Nadia Santos: You're a man of faith.
Arvin Sloane: Oh, my child. My child. [Nadia opens her restraints
  with a pen and stabs Sloane with the needle he used on her]
Nadia Santos: How do you like it?

Michael Vaughn: Whatever Lauren did to me, I want you to know I take
  full responsibility for what's happened. I messed up, and if you
  can't get past that, I understand. But will you try?
Sydney Bristow: I don't know.
Michael Vaughn: Will you at least think about it? Because it's all I
  can think about.
Sydney Bristow: Yeah. I will think about it.

Arvin Sloane: What you did yesterday, destroying all the fluid like
  that: I want you to know I was not angry with you. I was proud of
  your courage.
Nadia Santos: Every Sunday at the orphanage in San Telmo, they made
  us dress up in our finest clothes. They would have us stand in line
  for hours waiting to be chosen by families. I wouldn't do it. I'd
  make myself filthy and always frown. I didn't want to be chosen,
  because I knew... I knew that somewhere my dad was still looking
  for me. And one day he'd come to take me away from that place... If
  I had known it was you I was waiting for, I would have cleaned up.

Sydney Bristow: In the videotape, when Nadia was a child, she was
  drawing something. What I assume was Rambaldi's message. If the
  message was already relayed, why is she valuable?
Katya Derevko: Your sister was taken away from the laboratory before
  she could complete the message.

Katya Derevko: The only reason I joined the Russian Secret Service
  was to help Irina find her younger daughter. For years we heard
  nothing about her; every lead went cold. But then recently we found
  out that her father, Arvin Sloane, was also looking for her... What
  is it, Sydney?
Sydney Bristow: Sloane has her.

Jack Bristow: I know why you checked yourself out of medical services
  early. I know you're under the impression you're fine, that all you
  need to do is hold yourself together, bury yourself in work.
Michael Vaughn: Get to the point, Jack.

Jack Bristow: I suggest you focus your energy into achieving closure
  on this matter.
Michael Vaughn: No one wants Lauren in custody more than I do!
Jack Bristow: That's not the kind of closure I'm referring to.

Katya Derevko: I find you sexy, Jack. Deal with it.

Toni Cummings: Do you know how much being here cuts into my market
  share? Can't even get a lipstick in this place.

Michael Vaughn: I want to find your sister, but I need to find my
  wife. Lauren cannot be allowed to get away with what she's done.
Sydney Bristow: Well, Lauren might. And you have to be prepared to
  deal with that.

Toni Cummings: I want you.
Marshall Flinkman: C-Come again?
Toni Cummings: To work for me.

Marshall Flinkman: And... to be honest with you, I kind of like
  working for the good guys. No offense.
Toni Cummings: None taken.

Arvin Sloane: If we overload the cerebrum, her brain won't be able to
  function properly. She could die.
Julian Sark: But we would have the equation, wouldn't we?
Arvin Sloane: Don't. Don't push me, Julian.
Lauren Reed: You are wasting time we do not have. We have all chosen
  this path, Arvin. We have all made sacrifices. I trust you are
  willing to do the same.

Arvin Sloane: You're gonna be okay. I promise.
Nadia Santos: No, I won't. I guess the angel isn't coming.

Arvin Sloane: The deal's off. If you go quietly, you leave unharmed.
Lauren Reed: You remind me of my father. When he learned the CIA was
  close to identifying me as Covenant, he was willing to do anything
  to protect me, even take the fall. He loved me that much. He's dead
  now, because reaching this goal is far more important.

Sydney Bristow: [about Sloane] It's okay. You're safe. He will never
  hurt you again.
Nadia Santos: He protected me.


# "Alias" (2001) {Masquerade (#1.18)}
Sydney Bristow: Dad... I'm going to find her. I have to.
Jack Bristow: Searching for that woman will accomplish nothing! No
  good can come from it!
Sydney Bristow: I need to know where she is.
Jack Bristow: Sydney, we don't even know if she's still alive!
Sydney Bristow: I know
Jack Bristow: Even if she is, it doesn't change what she did!
Sydney Bristow: Dad, I know!
Jack Bristow: Do you expect her just to say..."I'm sorry"?
Sydney Bristow: I don't know what to expect!
Jack Bristow: Well, you better know exactly what to expect!... What
  could she ever say... that would satisfy you?

Sydney Bristow: Seeing him there in the car, looking so damaged -
  I've never seen him like that. The idea that I want to find my
  mother... it scares him.

Sydney Bristow: I know, and maybe I'm being reckless or selfish... or
  masochistic. But if my mother is alive, then I just have to know
  that. Can you help me get everything the CIA's got on her?
Michael Vaughn: Actually, I can't. All information concerning her has
  been classified omega 17 by the FBI, including her connections to
  the Rambaldi prophecy.

Sydney Bristow: No. I don't want an explanation. I came here because
  I need you to help me find her.
Arvin Sloane: Mmm. Sydney, how much do you remember about the year
  after you were told that your mother died?
Sydney Bristow: I remember... just feeling disconnected from
  everything. My father was away on business for most of that year.
Arvin Sloane: No. Your father spent six months in solitary in a
  federal prison. He was suspected of being in collusion with Laura.
  The FBI almost tried him for treason and even though he was
  vindicated, the damage was done. And he began to unravel.
Sydney Bristow: Unravel...
Arvin Sloane: He drank. He started taking unnecessary risks. Come on,
  Sydney, you know the father he was to you all those years. He took
  a long time to fully recover and I was under direct orders from the
  DCI not to let him know that Laura survived the accident.
  Unfortunately, that also required lying to you.

Sydney Bristow: I don't understand what Khasinau has to do with my
  mother!
Arvin Sloane: He has everything to do with your mother. He was her
  superior. When you first identified Khasinau as The Man, I
  recognized his name from your mother's investigations. I thought,
  "This has to be a coincidence." I did some checking. He was her
  superior back in his days at the KGB. This is the only clue I have
  to offer you. Get the microchip. The more we find out about
  Khasinau, the closer you get to your mother.

SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: Excuse me. May I cut in?
Marcus Dixon: Of course. But I should warn you: she likes to lead.

SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: I told you to meet me in San Pedro.
Sydney Bristow: I never got a letter.
SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: I didn't send you a letter. I wasn't allowed
  to discuss my reassignment. I encoded a message in a junk e-mail.
  You should've been able to pick it up from the subject line.
Sydney Bristow: [pauses] I always set my computer to filter out junk
  e-mail.

Michael Vaughn: Noah Hicks - you mentioned him in the initial
  background report you wrote when you first made contact with the
  CIA.
Sydney Bristow: We met when I was a trainee. We actually dated for a
  while.
Michael Vaughn: Really.
Sydney Bristow: We kept it under the radar. SD-6 discourages, you
  know, fraternization among agents.
Michael Vaughn: So does the CIA.

Francie Calfo: Well, why is there a return ticket from Italy in her
  pocket?
Will Tippin: Probably from another trip.
Francie Calfo: It's dated for last week.
Will Tippin: Why wouldn't she tell us about a trip to Italy?

Sydney Bristow: A lot's happened since you left. And I want to fill
  you in but... I don't know if I feel comfortable doing that yet.
SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: Right. You're still mad.
Sydney Bristow: No. When you left and you just disappeared, it was a
  kick in the stomach, and I carried that around for a long time.
SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: You were the last person that I ever wanted to
  see again. Ever. And you were the only person that I ever wanted to
  see again.


# "Alias" (2001) {Maternal Instinct (#5.11)}
Irina Derevko: [about being an agent and a mother] In time you'll
  learn... you can't do both.
Sydney Bristow: Watch me.

Irina: The only reason I saved the baby was because you're my
  daughter.

Irina: And at that moment I was sure of one thing: I couldn't be an
  agent and a mother. I'd either fail at one or both. And I chose to
  fail at being a mother.

Agent Jack Bristow: [to Sydney] Cover your mother.


# "Alias" (2001) {Mea Culpa (#1.9)}
Marshall Flinkman: [holding a gadget] Okay, now, this thing sucks...
  literally. Sucks all the information from the computer hard drive
  right into the internal flash RAM.

Sydney Bristow: So, SD-6 wants to send out a message to everyone else
  they do business with.
Michael Vaughn: Don't mess with SD-6.

Arvin Sloane: We both are. We're both doing our job. And I look at
  Sydney Bristow's test results - I don't see a single spike. She
  didn't falter once.
SD-6 Agent Dreyer: She's guilty. She's the one.
Arvin Sloane: I think that's a dangerous accusation made by a
  desperate man.
SD-6 Agent Dreyer: I'm not desperate, Mr. Sloane. But I am curious
  why you feel the need to defend Miss Bristow?

Francie Calfo: [as Sydney is packing to go on yet another trip] You
  should report your boss to the corporate office.
Sydney Bristow: No kidding.

Arvin Sloane: I always knew there was something about you, from the
  first time I saw you.
Sydney Bristow: A lot can change in seven years.
Arvin Sloane: It's been a lot longer than seven years. I've known
  your father since 1971. I met him at Langley. I knew your mother. I
  went to your parents' wedding. Sydney, I've known you since you
  were a baby. I was out of the country for most of your childhood,
  various operations, but I kept tabs on you. I checked in on you in
  my own way. I always thought of you as my daughter, even from the
  beginning. Well, I just wanted to let you know... before you went
  away.

Will Tippin: Okay, okay, whatever, it sucks, all right? But it's why
  I wanted to become a reporter. I saw this when I was a kid and I
  loved it. And I was just like, I don't know, all the quick...
Will Tippin: Repartee.
Will Tippin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it just looked fun. You know,
  being a reporter looked fun. But it's not. It's not fun. It's a
  pain in the ass.

Arvin Sloane: You have your answer regarding Sydney Bristow.
SD-6 Agent Dreyer: What are you protecting?
Arvin Sloane: Mr. Dreyer, I still believe we have a situation here at
  SD-6. I strongly suggest you keep looking for the mole and stop
  questioning every decision I make.

Disguised Voice: [on the phone] You have questions about Kate Jones.
  How far are you willing to go, Mr. Tippin? I need to hear the words
  "I'm ready."
Will Tippin: Why? Why, could my life be in danger?
Disguised Voice: Say the words.
Will Tippin: Yeah, I'm in. I'm ready.


# "Alias" (2001) {No Hard Feelings (#5.15)}
Vaughn: Marshall! I'm gonna need a green light in a hurry!
Agent Marshall Flinkman: Easyer said than done. It's all in
  german..."Anschlag"?
Agent Jack Bristow: "Gruen"


# "Alias" (2001) {Page 47 (#1.15)}
Arvin Sloane: [watching a video of Will's visit to the prison] Lompoc
  prison, about two hours ago. The man talking to Tippin is David
  McNeil, software designer. About eight years ago, he created an
  encryption system that we wanted to acquire but he wouldn't sell.
  We don't have audio, but we got hold of the prison log. This is
  Tippin's third visit to McNeil in the last two weeks. You and I
  talked about Tippin some time ago. You convinced me that he was
  just a harmless metro reporter, far from a credible threat.

Sydney Bristow: We still are. Less so since she's been diagnosed.
  She's been a little reclusive. Actually, I haven't seen her since
  before I learned the truth about her husband.
Michael Vaughn: I think this is a real opportunity. We'd like you to
  call Emily. Tell her you'd like to see her again and get invited to
  their house.

Sydney Bristow: [holding a paperclip] This is a bug?
Michael Vaughn: It's good, huh? You should see the guys who make it,
  it's like they've never seen sunlight.
Sydney Bristow: Well, you should meet Marshall.

Sydney Bristow: That's where we want it. Especially now that SD-6 has
  the Rambaldi book. The C.I.A.'s been studying those photos you
  took.
Sydney Bristow: Then they turned out all right?
Michael Vaughn: There's one blank page. Well, C.I.A. sci-tech says
  that of the few Rambaldi documents they've recovered, the
  forty-seventh page is always particularly significant. This blank
  page was number forty-seven. Your father's strategizing on how to
  get it out of SD-6 and replace it with a counterfeit. But in the
  meantime, we're just hoping we learn something with that bug.

Francie Calfo: Dear Aunt Stephanie. Unfortunately, as my mother has
  informed you, the wedding is off so I am returning your kind gift
  of a coffee maker because, as it turns out, the man to whom I was
  engaged is a deceitful, two-faced, sex-crazed jackass. All my love,
  Francie.
Sydney Bristow: It's not too harsh.

Will Tippin: Sydney tells me you're doing analysis for the bank.
Jack Bristow: Strategy. Investment strategy. Arvin made me an offer I
  couldn't refuse.
Emily Sloane: Oh, that sounds like my husband!

Arvin Sloane: Some of the text is Italian, but most of it is in code.
  Code we haven't been able to break. Who was this man, Sydney? What
  did he see? What did Rambaldi see? [Flipping through the pages of
  Rambaldi's book, he comes to page forty-seven, the blank one] Those
  who know about him - various agencies, a few in the private sector
  - they're spending millions to answer these questions. Millions.
  Men would die for this book. Men have died. You know, Sydney, the
  work we're doing here, trying to figure out who Rambaldi was, what
  he was working on, is becoming an obsession for me.

Will Tippin: [talking to the man in prison] I was kidnapped
  yesterday. By - I don't know who they were but I'm assuming they
  work for SD-6. David, they threatened me. They told me to drop the
  story. [pause] David, I hate myself for letting you down, okay? But
  right now, I'm you. I'm exactly where you were before your wife was
  killed. Now, if I do what you suggest... David, they're going to
  kill my family... my friends. If you could go back, if you could
  change it, you wouldn't hesitate, would you?


# "Alias" (2001) {Pandora (#4.15)}
Sabina: Is he any good or just eye candy?

Vaughn: Consider this the second time you've been rejected by the CIA

Sloane: [after Nadia visits Katya in prison to ask about her mother]
  What did she tell you?
Nadia Santos: Nothing I didn't already know. That she was a criminal,
  a murderer.
Sloane: Sweetheart, no one is a single thing.


# "Alias" (2001) {Parity (#1.3)}
Sydney Bristow: I don't want it to be like that anymore, I'm just
  sick of it. I mean, I always had this feeling that maybe someday, I
  don't know, my dad and I would connect. That things could start to
  get better.
Francie Calfo: Well, you know my opinion of your dad.
Sydney Bristow: I know.
Francie Calfo: But listen. If you can find it in your heart to
  forgive him for being the kind of guy he's been all your life,
  which I would find impossible and could never do, then you should
  make a real effort.

Sydney Bristow: See you when I get back.
Michael Vaughn: No, actually, you won't. Uh, I'm being replaced by a
  senior officer. It seems I wasn't experienced enough to be your
  handler.

Sydney Bristow: Are you insane? Calling me in here for a social
  event? SD-6 has a division whose sole responsibility it is to track
  their agents and report back suspect activity. "Your girl" is
  risking her life, and you yours, every time we lay eyes on each
  other. So, do me a favor: don't be so friendly.
C.I.A. Agent Seth Lambert: I-I just love your spirit.
Sydney Bristow: That's heartening. Are we done here?

C.I.A. Agent Seth Lambert: I hate to pull rank, but time is a factor
  here.
Sydney Bristow: Time is a factor here. You know how much time? Seven
  years. That's how long I worked for SD-6 before I found out who
  they really are. And now that I know, my days of blindly following
  orders are over.
C.I.A. Agent Seth Lambert: Who the hell do you think you're talking
  to?
Sydney Bristow: I know exactly who I'm talking to. Tell Devlin if
  Agent Vaughn isn't on the other end of this earpiece when I turn it
  on, the C.I.A. gets nothing.

Sydney Bristow: Who am I talking to?
Michael Vaughn: Your invisible friend.
Sydney Bristow: Good. Where are you?
Michael Vaughn: Satellite relay station back in L.A., watching you
  from a 200 mile orbit.
Sydney Bristow: My guardian angel.


# "Alias" (2001) {Passage: Part 1 (#2.8)}
Irina: Agnet Vaughn has trouble sleeping. When you're in the field.
Sydney: I doubt he told you that.
Irina: No he didn't have to tell me I could see it in his eyes.
  You're so willing to take risks for your country, why aren't you
  willing to do the same for you're own happiness?
Jack: I hardly think you've earned he right to give anyone
  relationship advice.

Sydney: [to Sark] I'm here to remind you what I hope is obvious but I
  don't wanna overestimate your intelligence. If you burn me, I burn
  you.

Sydney: Sloane wouldn't agree to partner with him unless Sark made it
  worth his while. Do you have any idea what they're after?
Jack: Given the scope of Sark's previous contacts and operations, he
  could be offering almost anything. What concerns me more is that
  your mother knew we were double agents before she turned herself
  in. She may have told Sark.
Sydney: I'll find out.
Jack: Before you do, consider this: two months ago she surrendered to
  the CIA. Yesterday, Sark made a back-door agreement with Sloane
  that places him inside SD-6. Do you believe that's just a
  coincidence?

Marshall Flinkman: Hi. Welcome. Don't kill me.
Julian Sark: Look, I understand that none of you are inclined to
  believe a word I say but I assure you, it's not in my best interest
  to betray you. You've given me an opportunity of a lifetime, and I
  don't intend to squander it.

Sydney: You saved Vaughn's life. I'm grateful to you for that but I
  haven't made up my mind yet if I should trust you.
Irina: And yet here you are. I never told Sark about your status as a
  double agent, Sydney. That doesn't mean you're safe. Tell me, what
  intelligence has he provided Sloane?

Irina: I cannot give you details because I don't trust the CIA. They
  almost had me executed two weeks ago. The only way for me to
  maintain my value is to tell you only what you need to know in
  order to stay ahead of Sloane. And all you need to know now is that
  if I'm not allowed to leave, everything you've worked to accomplish
  will be lost.

Julian Sark: I must admit, this is one of the most impressive
  operations I've seen. Though it is a touch pathetic how so many of
  them believe they actually work for the CIA.
Arvin Sloane: Look at me. You've offered me a substantial prize to
  make our partnership worthwhile, but do not think for a second that
  gives you the right to insult my people.

Arvin Sloane: I've been a presence in Sydney's life since she was
  born. Sydney will believe whatever I tell her to.
Julian Sark: And her father? He must often battle the temptation to
  tell her the truth about SD-6. I'd hate to see Jack's paternal
  instincts compromise our objectives. So, for the time being, I
  wouldn't tell him what those codes are really for.

Mysterious Caller: We have your wife, and, yes, she's alive. You will
  provide us with the account numbers for all of SD-6's investments,
  or the Alliance will be informed that you failed to carry out her
  execution.
Arvin Sloane: Offer me proof that she's alive. Until then, know this:
  as soon as I hang up the phone I will use every available resource
  to find out who I'm talking to and when I do, it will be my sincere
  pleasure to make your acquaintance.

Michael Vaughn: I didn't think Devlin, my superior, would mind me
  having you research this, but he did and he ordered me to let you
  go.
Will Tippin: Hold on. Wait a second. There's something here. Okay,
  look, I'll narrow the test scores down to a small group of kids.
  Now Devlin won't be able to deny the value of that.
Michael Vaughn: He thinks since you're a journalist, since you've
  been trained to report what you know, that you're a security risk.

Michael Vaughn: This watch belonged to my father. It's broken now,
  but it used to keep perfect time. And when he gave it to me, he
  said, "You could set your heart by this watch". It stopped October
  1st: the day we met. [Sydney is about to respond when her pager
  goes off, then Vaughn's goes off as well. They look to see who it
  is] Kendall.
Sydney: Me too.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Well, if she was so concerned about
  helping us stay ahead of SD-6, she could have told us what was at
  stake.
Irina: And what would you have done? Given Sydney false control codes
  to hand over to SD-6? Sark may have known the difference and she
  would have been exposed as a double agent. I wasn't willing to risk
  her life that way.

Sydney: You said you didn't tell us the truth because you were trying
  to protect me, because you didn't want to risk Sark finding out
  that I was a double agent. The thing is, someone now has the
  ability to detonate six nuclear weapons and I am responsible. So I
  am going to be part of the team that finds and disarms those
  warheds no matter what you do. But if you were telling the truth
  when you said you wanted to protect me, then, Mom, I need your
  help.

Will Tippin: [to Vaughn] Look, except for you, Sydney, and Jack,
  everybody I know - and a lot of people I don't - they think I'm a
  lying junkie, okay? And helping you, doing something for the CIA,
  it felt like a chance to do something that mattered again, you
  know? Like, I don't know, maybe I went through all this crap for a
  reason.

Irina: Jack, we're in enemy territory and the PRF knows we're here.
  We need to start trusting each other right now.

Will Tippin: Nothing's wrong? [she shakes her head negatively] Syd,
  if we'd just met I'd know something's wrong

Jack: When it comes to Irina Derevko, my judgment's proven to be...
  impaired.


# "Alias" (2001) {Passage: Part 2 (#2.9)}
Michael Vaughn: I just don't think we should cut them loose.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Listen. Alive or dead, the mission
  failed. So if the Bristows are out there, they're on their own.

Sydney Bristow: Deploy? Detonate?
Michael Vaughn: "Activate." That's the word they used. Now, it might
  mean delivery, maybe detonation, we don't know. But we have to
  assume the worst since they got the control codes through SD-6.
Sydney Bristow: And I got the control codes for SD-6 which means I
  can deactivate the nukes.
Michael Vaughn: If you get there in time.

Sydney Bristow: [to Vaughn] You know, some people go miniature
  golfing with their parents. We go to India and look for nukes.

Arvin Sloane: What do you want?
Mysterious Caller: One hundred million in bearer bonds.
Arvin Sloane: This is about money?
Mysterious Caller: Everything is about money. Instructions for the
  drop have been electronically mailed to you. You have twenty-four
  hours. Fail to deliver the bonds, and the next delivery will go to
  the Alliance.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Contact the Bristows, tell them to
  pull out immediately.
Michael Vaughn: I have no way of initiating. Why?
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: The Indians found out the Pakastani
  rebels have acquired nukes. They're launching air strikes in
  twenty-four hours.

Michael Vaughn: Look, you're probably going to say no to this but I
  want to go to India. I was stationed there for two years, I have
  relationships...
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Go.
Michael Vaughn: Go?
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: I'll have a military aircraft waiting.
  This is totally back channel.
Michael Vaughn: You're just gonna... Are you trying to get rid of me?

Alliance Member Ramon Veloso: Who else knew about your instruction to
  kill Emily?
Arvin Sloane: Only the people in this room.
Alliance Member Alain Christophe: You believe one of us may be behind
  this?
Arvin Sloane: No. But someone has infiltrated our secure
  communications.

Irina Derevko: [In India] So, Sydney, how's school?
Sydney Bristow: I'm writing my dissertation... supposedly.

Gerard Cuvee: Not to brag, but I'm kind of responsible for
  matchmaking you and Irina. Didn't she tell you? I was a supervisor
  at the KGB. I was the one who gave her the assignment to go to the
  US and marry a CIA officer. Now, you weren't the only prospect, of
  course. But you had the most potential. Ha! I actually thought it
  would dawn on you that a woman like this would never go for someone
  like you. Luckily for me, your ego was too big for that.

Jack Bristow: She was putting on a show for Cuvee. Before she left,
  she put these in my hand. She told me they're using the cores to
  activate a Rambaldi artifact.
Sydney Bristow: They're not detonating the nukes?
Jack Bristow: Among the things Rambaldi experimented with was
  self-sustaining cell regeneration. This artifact they're opening
  today is reported to be Rambaldi's proof of endless life.

Irina Derevko: [Irina's back in her cell] You must have a lot of
  questions.
Sydney Bristow: Yeah.
Irina Derevko: One thing that should not wait any longer is why I
  shot you in Taipei. The rebel leader, Gerard Cuvee... When you were
  in Taipei, he was in the next room watching to see if I would
  betray him or you. Shooting you in the shoulder, giving you time to
  escape, it was the only way I could think to maintain his trust and
  keep him from killing both of us.


# "Alias" (2001) {Phase One (#2.13)}
Michael Vaughn: I'm going to say something, and it will either be
  obvious to you or seem presumptuous, either way I'm going to say
  it. This isn't working. I've been thinking about this for a while,
  I don't know what the hell to do.
Sydney Bristow: What?
Michael Vaughn: I think you know what.
Sydney Bristow: I need you to tell me.
Michael Vaughn: You need me to tell you what, that when you're on
  operations I can't sleep at night, that when we're in debrief I
  have to force myself to remember what the hell we're supposed to be
  reviewing when all I want to do is kiss you.
Sydney Bristow: Sometimes it is hard to remember what we're supposed
  to be talking about.
Michael Vaughn: That's what I'm talking about, and the thing that
  drives me insane every day is that the people who would kill us if
  we were ever seen together-the Alliance, SD-6, Sloane, are the very
  forces that brought you into my life. What kind of a sick joke is
  that?
Sydney Bristow: So what are you thinking, that maybe we shouldn't be
  working together?
Michael Vaughn: Yes, that was what I was thinking, but we're great
  together, and the more we work together the sooner the Alliance
  gets destroyed.
Sydney Bristow: So, what are you suggesting? [Agent Weiss interrupts]
Eric Weiss: What is this, the flirting corner?
Michael Vaughn: Uh, we're talking.
Eric Weiss: Yeah, I figured that out. Uh, there's a meeting...
  National Security, remember that? It's important... for the
  people...
Sydney Bristow: We'll be right there

Sydney Bristow: Excuse me. Sloane's being replaced?
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: He's been MIA for five days. With
  Sloane gone and Geiger coming in, we no longer have access to their
  inner circle. So, Sydney and Jack, your assignment is to get close
  to Geiger, earn his trust, get back in that inner circle. That's
  it.

Julian Sark: The new boss has a dreadful personality, don't you
  think?
Sydney Bristow: I've seen worse.
Julian Sark: Am I supposed to take that personally?
Sydney Bristow: Sark, what do you want?
Julian Sark: When I met with Geiger this morning, I left his office
  feeling as unstrung as you look.
Sydney Bristow: Just so you know, I'm fully strung.

Sydney Bristow: There's only one reason Sloane would keep secret the
  existence of a computer. Because this computer server forty-seven
  is a vulnerability.
Jack Bristow: Until you tell me what you're suggesting, I have
  nothing to respond to.
Sydney Bristow: I think there's a central Alliance computer: I think
  that's what server forty-seven is. A network that links all the SD
  cells. It makes sense, doesn't it?

Michael Vaughn: We tracked down server forty-seven. The reason you
  couldn't get a twenty on it is because it doesn't exist on this
  planet. It's in the sky. It's a 747 purchased by the Alliance in
  1998. They retrofitted the interior to contain a secure server and
  a satellite uplink.

Eric Weiss: OK, whenever you want to have that talk...
Michael Vaughn: What talk?
Eric Weiss: Uh, about the cologne, or whatever the hell you're
  wearing.
Michael Vaughn: I'm not wearing any cologne.
Eric Weiss: Well, something is going on. No man naturally smells as
  good as you do right now
Michael Vaughn: [Vaughn and Weiss watch as a sleazy bad guy leers at
  Sydney while she's in disguise as a prostitute] That son of a
  bitch!
Eric Weiss: Easy, come on.
Michael Vaughn: I swear I'm gonna to kill this guy.
Eric Weiss: There's no way that guy smells as good as you do.
Michael Vaughn: It's aftershave, I got a new aftershave.
Eric Weiss: Yeah, well, I'd lighten up on it a little.
Michael Vaughn: Yeah?
Eric Weiss: Oh yeah. To the point of non-use.

Will Tippin: Okay, the suspense is killing me. What's the occasion?
Francie Calfo: The restaurant is actually making a profit.
Will Tippin: After only six months? Is that even possible?

Jack Bristow: The answer is in the document. According to the
  information you retrieved, each SD cell uses a code which changes
  weekly to operate their security system. The current code is listed
  right here.
Michael Vaughn: So you're saying we need to get into SD-6 and find
  out what the actual code is right now?
Sydney Bristow: If it matches the one in the document, then the rest
  of the intel is real.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: In which case I could go to Langley
  about raiding the Alliance facilities.
Michael Vaughn: Do we have the current SD-6 code?
Jack Bristow: No. But I can get it.

Michael Vaughn: Did he get the code? Syd?
Sydney Bristow: He was compromised.
Michael Vaughn: What?
Sydney Bristow: He just said "Take surface streets, they're doing
  some work on the freeway".
Michael Vaughn: I don't understand.
Sydney Bristow: It's a phrase we came up with last year. A code to
  let one of us know if the other was ever discovered, to warn them
  to stay away. He's with Geiger now.

Anthony Geiger: Jack, I know you are disloyal. I know your daughter
  is too. Both your files, there were so many red flags, I thought I
  was in a Russian airport.

Marcus Dixon: No, this does not MAKE ANY SENSE!
Sydney Bristow: YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME! I can't go back there or
  they will kill me too! We need you to go into SD-6. We need you to
  hack into the system and make visible a hidden file, one that you
  would never see, never know was there. It's a code. A number that
  we need. If it's a match to one we already have, it will confirm
  the data and the CIA will raid SD-6 and every Alliance office! If
  you follow these instructions to get the code you will be in the
  core of the SD-6 computer network and you'll see... it's not CIA.
  It's Alliance. I'll wait for your e-mail but you need to hurry.

Eric Weiss: Hey guys! I just talked to base. We did it; we kicked
  their asses! [Sydney and Vaughn keep kissing] Hey! Guys! Did you
  hear what I said? Asses... kicked...

Julian Sark: Sydney leaked the intel to the CIA and the rest played
  out exactly as you predicted it would. So congratulations, sir. The
  Alliance is gone.
Arvin Sloane: We shouldn't celebrate yet. As you know, there's much
  more work to be done.
Julian Sark: I just wanted to let you know that phase one is
  complete.

Gils Nacor: [Sydney comes in wearing a black lingerie set] [in
  French] No, put on the red one.
Gils Nacor: [Sydney now appears in a red lingerie set] [in French,
  approvingly] Not bad, that's better. [Nacor's bodyguard exits the
  room and Syd goes to the bed with Nacor]
Sydney: [Sydney pulls a wire from her bracelet, wraps it around
  Nacor's neck and starts tightening it] [seemingly agitated] What
  was wrong with the black one?


# "Alias" (2001) {Prelude (#3.7)}
Arvin Sloane: There was a time you trusted me.
Sydney Bristow: That was before I knew who you were... That was
  before I knew who "I" was.

Michael Vaughn: You killed Javier Perez, you son of a bitch!
Jack Bristow: You've just returned from a traumatic experience, Mr.
  Vaughn. You're understandably emotional, which would explain your
  baseless accusation.
Michael Vaughn: You're right, I am emotional. I get that way when I
  see a gun pressed to my wife's temple!
Jack Bristow: Ours is a risky business.

Michael Vaughn: If you ever put my wife's life in danger again, I
  will kill you!
Jack Bristow: Then perhaps you finally understand the moral
  compromises you'll make when someone you love is in danger.

Julian Sark: I understand your investigation into the Lazarey murder
  has hit a dead end. What a pity.
Lauren Reed: How do you know about that?
Julian Sark: I know because I framed Javier Perez, assuming he'd be
  extradited to the United States, and that once he was in custody,
  he'd be forced to confess what he knows... namely, the identity of
  Andrian Lazarey's murderer.

Julian Sark: I recently learned that Sydney Bristow murdered a father
  I never had a chance to know. I suspect you have your own reasons
  for disliking her; therefore I'm confident that you'll relay this
  information to the appropriate parties.

Jack Bristow: Sloane gave you a key, which he claims was sent to him
  some time before you woke up in Hong Kong.
Sydney Bristow: Yeah, his claim was pretty convincing: it was written
  in my handwriting.

Jack Bristow: Remember when I told you that during the time you were
  missing, I contacted your mother? That cipher text was encoded
  using a method that she devised.
Sydney Bristow: What does this mean? That I was in contact with Mom
  during the two years I was gone?

Michael Vaughn: ...You already reported her.
Lauren Reed: You followed your orders. I followed mine.

Sydney Bristow: If the NSC wants to find me, they will. Look, I was
  someone else for two years, Vaughn... someone I don't even
  remember. What am I supposed to do now? Spend the rest of my life
  in hiding?
Michael Vaughn: Between that and a lobotomy, there isn't a choice!
Sydney Bristow: I can't keep running forever.
Michael Vaughn: I'll do everything I can to make sure you won't have
  to.

Michael Vaughn: You should go.
Sydney Bristow: Vaughn... why are you doing this? My life is already
  a disaster... now yours is, too.
Michael Vaughn: What happened between us... everything... the way it
  is... isn't anyone's fault, Sydney. And even though everything's
  changed... some things don't. I'm not gonna lose you twice.

Lauren Reed: Under authority of the National Security Council, Robert
  Lindsay has instructed me to relieve you of duty as director of
  this task force until he arrives to assume control.
Marcus Dixon: On what grounds?
Lauren Reed: Obstruction of justice. Willingly conspiring to impede
  an international investigation into the murder of Andrian Lazarey.

Lauren Reed: These premises are to be locked down until Lindsay
  arrives with Federal Agents. That means, until such time, nobody
  leaves.
Marcus Dixon: I take it you have Sydney in custody.
Lauren Reed: Not yet. But we know where she is.


# "Alias" (2001) {Q & A (#1.17)}
Michael Vaughn: I know, but the DNA sequencing, the heart size. I
  mean, they both match with what Rambaldi wrote. Either this thing
  is completely insane... or it isn't.
Eric Weiss: Okay, what happened? The FBI's involved?
Michael Vaughn: Yeah. There's an FBI tribunal flying in from DC.
  They're going to question her and decide what the next move is.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: How did you come to work with the CIA?
Sydney Bristow: Don't you already have a file on me?
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: We would like this in your words.

Sydney Bristow: The truth is, I didn't love any of the subjects I was
  studying. My father and I weren't speaking, my mother had died when
  I was six and the highlight of my social life was my dorm's salad
  bar. So, I called them.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: SD-6.
Sydney Bristow: They didn't use that name. These men led me to
  believe they were CIA. They were very convincing. They are very
  convincing.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: And at this time, you believed that
  SD-6 was affiliated with the CIA?
Sydney Bristow: Yes, that's right. That it was a black ops division
  of the CIA.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Meaning...
Sydney Bristow: You mean what is black ops? A division that is funded
  by the CIA's black budget. Operations that are highly classified,
  even hidden from congressional oversight. They led me to believe
  that SD-6 was one of these divisions and that that was why they
  didn't operate through Langley.

Michael Vaughn: You're saying that Sydney could be held long enough
  to blow her cover with SD-6?
Jack Bristow: Under directive 81A, they could conceivably hold her
  without trial or charges for the rest of her life.

C.I.A. Agent Steven Haladki: I think your judgment is impaired.
Michael Vaughn: I think I'm going to kick your ass.

Michael Vaughn: Hey, what did you say before about Haladki?
Eric Weiss: I don't think he showers?

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: What does "SD" stand for?
Sydney Bristow: Section Disparu - the section that doesn't exist.
  Alain Christophe, one of the Alliance founders. The term was his.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Explain to us about the Alliance of
  Twelve?
Sydney Bristow: The Alliance is like a board of directors. Some are
  from the private sector, but most are former intelligence officers.
  All wealthy. They started a company together, except this company -
  the Alliance - trades intelligence.

Michael Vaughn: According to Rambaldi, the woman in question, the
  subject of this prophecy, will have never seen Mt. Subasio. Meaning
  if Sydney were to go there and see it herself.
Jack Bristow: She couldn't possibly be the woman Rambaldi was talking
  about.
Michael Vaughn: That makes sense, doesn't it? I thought that made
  sense.

Jack Bristow: [to Haladki] I have no desire to blow your head off, or
  ruin your paint job, but I will do both unless you tell me where
  the hell Sydney Bristow is

Jack Bristow: [to Haladki] Just so we're clear: you report this
  conversation, and you'll never wear a hat again.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: What can you tell me about him?
Sydney Bristow: Milo Rambaldi was Pope Alexander VI's chief
  architect. He was an artist, an inventor. His designs were so
  technologically advanced, at the time, they thought he was heretic.
  And he was executed. Now, five hundred years later, many believe he
  was a prophet. And SD-6, CIA, GRU, K-Directorate, the entire
  intelligence world, is on a Rambaldi scavenger hunt.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Why?
Sydney Bristow: They assume that Rambaldi had some sort of master
  plan.

Sydney Bristow: You didn't think about it. Not once. The possibility
  that Rambaldi could be right about me.
Michael Vaughn: No. I didn't.
Sydney Bristow: Why not?
Michael Vaughn: Because I believe in you. Do you think I'd just throw
  anyone in my trunk?


# "Alias" (2001) {Reckoning (#1.6)}
Francie Calfo: Hey, how was your trip?
Sydney Bristow: Oh. Not good. I was working with these people who -
  they were terminated.
Francie Calfo: Oh, man. The economy sucks.

Sydney Bristow: What about the file - the one you pulled for me?
  There were pages missing. Maybe it didn't end twenty years ago.
  Maybe he's still working for Russia!
Michael Vaughn: Stop. Okay? Stop. What matters, what "is" important,
  is taking down SD-6. Jack - your father - is helping us do that!

Arvin Sloane: Jack will no longer be working out of Jennings
  Aerospace. His assignment there is complete. As of today, he will
  be working here with a cover as portfolio manager for Credit
  Dauphine. This way, he can more actively participate in the
  planning and execution of missions.
Sydney Bristow: [forces a smile] Good.

Sydney Bristow: I know about you! That you were hunted by the F.B.I.!
  And I know that mom died because they went after you.
Jack Bristow: Sydney...
Sydney Bristow: Every time I think I know just how awful you are, I
  learn something worse.

Sydney Bristow: Raid my closet!
Francie Calfo: Thanks, but I got boobs.


# "Alias" (2001) {Remnants (#3.10)}
Michael Vaughn: [to Sloane] Despite the fact that he almost killed
  her, the doctor was great.

Michael Vaughn: [about Sydney] If you betray her, I swear to you no
  matter what it costs me, I will kill you.
Arvin Sloane: No need to worry, Agent Vaughn. I love her too.

Will Tippin: The fact that I actually wasn't dating Francie, that it
  was her double... I thought that was, like, the number one most
  insane story of all time. But yours actually tops it.
Sydney Bristow: She survived.

Will Tippin: You know, I always thought of myself as a pacifist. The
  idea of taking someone's life is just inconceivable. But if I had
  the chance to kill Allison...
Sydney Bristow: I never would've come here if I didn't have to.

Sydney Bristow: Last chance to bail out.
Will Tippin: What, are you kidding me? I love this stuff.

Will Tippin: It was Julia Thorne. She told me your name. She needs to
  see you. She trusts you, but she's in danger.
Lazarey: Did they find it? Have they been to Graz?

Will Tippin: You've been going over this since the beginning of time.
  You'll figure it out.
Sydney Bristow: What makes you say that?
Will Tippin: Because you're you.

Michael Vaughn: Think that was the best move? Punching Lindsey in the
  face?
Jack Bristow: Based on the comments he was making, it was obvious
  that you and I were going to end up here no matter what we did.
  Whether I hit him or not. I wasn't about to pass up the
  opportunity.

Jack Bristow: You and I have something in common. We both suffered
  through the death of the woman we loved only to discover that she
  was still alive. I know, it's hard. But this isn't about you. And I
  will not allow my daughter to become your mistress.
Michael Vaughn: If that's where you think my concern for Sydney is
  headed, then you are even more cynical than I thought.

Jack Bristow: [to Vaughn] If you care about my daughter as you claim
  to, then push her away. Be cruel if you have to... make her despise
  you. Because your kindness tortures her. I can see it, what it does
  to her. And I won't have it.

Sydney Bristow: I've never been a depressed person... until now.

Emilio Gamboni: Just when I was beginning to believe the glowing
  reports about you being such a humanitarian.
Arvin Sloane: You're a smarter man than that.

Will Tippin: When Lazarey spoke, he didn't sound like it was
  somewhere protected.
Sydney Bristow: I know. That's why I'm thinking, bank or maybe hotel
  safety deposit box.
Will Tippin: How come?
Sydney Bristow: Because that's where I'd put it.

Desk Attendant: Checking in?
Will Tippin: [with British accent] Of course. I'm here, she's here.
  We made it.
Desk Attendant: And you are...?
Sydney Bristow: We're the next big thing.

Sydney Bristow: It was a little over the top.
Will Tippin: Over the top? I'm wearing seat covering, there is no
  "over the top".

Will Tippin: You have to admit, my accent was pretty good. It was,
  like, early Stones.
Sydney Bristow: I thought it was Australian.

Arvin Sloane: Sydney, you have my word.
Sydney Bristow: That's a relief.

Sydney Bristow: You murdered Robert Lindsey.
Arvin Sloane: I think you already know my response.
Sydney Bristow: Let me guess: you don't know what I'm talking about.
Arvin Sloane: Not a word.

Arvin Sloane: The deceiver was Lindsey. Not me. His team might've
  thought so, but apparently Lindsey never gave us the Rambaldi
  device. It was a setup.
Sydney Bristow: I don't know how you did this, but you're not going
  to get away with it.
Arvin Sloane: I don't know what you're talking about.

Marshall Flinkman: It's what was inside the box. It's human tissue -
  like, still active. Oh, and there was a name etched inside the box:
  Milo Rambaldi.

Will Tippin: [about killing Allison] I thought if I had the chance,
  killing her would be satisfying. You know, there'd be closure...
  but it's just as empty as the dreams. There's no satisfaction.
  There's nothing


# "Alias" (2001) {Rendezvous (#1.21)}
Jack Bristow: You're going to tell your contact you want a meeting. A
  meeting to take place at your contact's discretion.
Will Tippin: Why would he lead me to you knowing that you'd want to
  flush him out?
Jack Bristow: He only told you my name so you would realize that my
  threat to you was a bluff. That I would never hurt Sydney, even if
  you continue your investigation. He didn't expect you'd have the
  guts to contact me.
Will Tippin: Oh, well, I'll assume that's a compliment.

Jack Bristow: Kretchmer briefed me on Denpasar. It was a sloppy
  operation. Your pursuit of your mother is clouding your judgement.
  You can't afford to continue and at the moment, I can't protect
  you. I haven't regained Sloane's trust. He still hasn't reinstated
  me to active duty. I'm not even privy to his briefings.
Sydney Bristow: Then you haven't heard that SD-6 got Sark.

Julian Sark: I understand I am in no position to demand anything, but
  for the record, I'm far more comfortable talking over a glass of
  Chateau Petreuse... '82.

Eric Weiss: I don't want your thanks. I want it to stop.
Michael Vaughn: Look, Sydney's my responsibility...
Eric Weiss: Mike, I'm not going to trivialize your relationship with
  her by calling it a crush...
Michael Vaughn: A crush?
Eric Weiss: But whatever it is, it's starting to affect me and if
  that sounds selfish to you, I was hoping to retire fully vested. I
  know you genuinely care for her. I do, too. But there is a line
  that we have been sworn not to cross. We're about a mile past that.
Michael Vaughn: I don't know how to be Sydney's handler without
  making it personal.
Eric Weiss: Figure out a way

Sydney Bristow: None of this changes the fact that you were using
  Will!
Jack Bristow: He was already being used! It's no coincidence that out
  of all the reporters in the world, he was chosen.
Sydney Bristow: What are you saying?
Jack Bristow: For some reason, Khasinau is trying to expose us.

Will Tippin: [to Sydney ans Jack] Who the hell are you people?

Michael Vaughn: Anyway, I read your debrief. So did Devlin. We'll
  deal with the loss of the Rambaldi document later but first you
  should know that, uh, offices of security is drawing up a
  contingency plan to keep Will Tippin safe.
Sydney Bristow: What kind of contingencies?
Michael Vaughn: Witness protection. Worst-case scenario, recruitment.
Sydney Bristow: Absolutely not!

Sydney Bristow: He is my friend. He is, like, one of my best friends.
Michael Vaughn: I understand that.
Sydney Bristow: No, you don't. You get to tell your friends that you
  work for the CIA while I go home and look desperately for a tiny
  moment that I can be honest with anyone about anything. Now that
  Will knows the truth - he's never going to trust me again. You
  should have seen his face in Paris. It was like he was looking at a
  stranger.
Michael Vaughn: But he wasn't. He was looking at you. Maybe for the
  first time. He was looking at you.


# "Alias" (2001) {Repercussions (#3.5)}
Sydney Bristow: When am I going to see you again? I have so many
  questions...
Simon Walker: Bout what?
Sydney Bristow: Everything...
Simon Walker: Oh, yeah, well, we work well together. And I have your
  number; there's always going to be another job coming up... I'll
  call you.

Sydney Bristow: A member of Walker's team caught Michael; I still
  don't know how. Walker ID'd him as CIA...
Lauren Reed: ...and stabbed him and left him for dead. I already know
  all this. It's in the briefing. Thank you.
Sydney Bristow: Lauren, that's not... Walker had a gun to Michael's
  head. He was about to pull the trigger. I took his knife... I
  stabbed him myself.

Lauren Reed: Sloane is attending an NPO conference in Mexico City. I
  have a briefing scheduled with him the day after tomorrow.
Sydney Bristow: I'm still catching up; What did Sloane have to do
  with this?
Lauren Reed: Sloane gave us the intel that led to Bomani's arrest.
  The subsequent dismantling of his terror network wasn't simply one
  of the reasons we agreed to pardon Sloane: it was the predominant
  reason. He might have a lead.

Lauren Reed: I don't know about you, but I can't work to the best of
  my abilities while wondering whether or not I'm being polite enough
  to my husband's ex-girlfriend.
Sydney Bristow: You don't need to be polite with me. We're both past
  formalities.
Lauren Reed: Then I'll be blunt. I want you to request a transfer to
  another field office.

Sydney Bristow: I know we're being blunt, but was that a threat? You
  don't have the authority to have me transferred.
Lauren Reed: The NSC will support me, when they learn that our
  working together is compromising their fight against the Covenant.

Arvin Sloane: [to Bomani] Yes, I turned you in, as you would have
  done me. Why? To obtain what you now need: legitimacy. In a
  nutshell, Mr. Bomani, I could help you become more powerful than
  ever.

Lauren Reed: What I said about requesting you transferred to another
  field office... it wasn't my place. And it's... it's hard; but I'd
  really like this to work.
Sydney Bristow: I appreciate you saying that.

Sydney Bristow: You're telling us you gave this information to a man
  who is working with the Covenant.
Arvin Sloane: That's right. And now I'm giving it to you. So that you
  can disable it before the Covenant gets it.

Lauren Reed: You've told Bomani you'd work for the Covenant?
Arvin Sloane: Yes. And now I'm telling you that I'm in the position
  to be a double agent. Working for the Covenant but loyal to the
  CIA... What is it, Sydney?
Sydney Bristow: [in disbelief] This is classic...

Marshall Flinkman: Now as far as our technology can detect - and
  these are next gen tests, as high-end as it gets - he's not lyin',
  folks.
Sydney Bristow: If there's someone who can fool those tests, it's
  Sloane.
Marshall Flinkman: Yeah, well, in theory, yes. But in practice, he'd
  really have to be using the next gen's next gen lie detector
  defeating tech, which frankly, even I can't imagine.

Sydney Bristow: Okay. Just so someone has said it: in the past two
  years, Sloane has obtained a pardon based mainly on the capture of
  a criminal who is now free. In addition, Sloane will be allowed to
  openly participate in Covenant activities, based on the promise
  that he will inform us of those activities. One could argue that
  he's just pulled off the con job of the century.
Lauren Reed: It also appears that Bomani will kill Sloane if we
  interfere with his plans.
Sydney Bristow: And who here would lose sleep over that?

Simon Walker: On a scale of one to ten, ten being the most degenerate
  displays of sexual theater known to man? Huh... Julia's like a 17!

Marshall Flinkman: If I were any more nervous, I'd need new
  underpants just about now.

Eric Weiss: Vaughn will back me up. This is a true story, I swear.
  Sophmore year, college. Her name was April First.
Michael Vaughn: Birth name, by the way.
Eric Weiss: Right. And for a month I was obsessed. I though this
  women had to have my children, okay? The problem was that she only
  dated guitar players. Literally.
Lauren Reed: A girl should have her standards.
Michael Vaughn: Since she worked at a coffeehouse, Eric decided to
  impress her on open-mike night.
Sydney Bristow: You play the guitar?
Eric Weiss: No, no not even a little. But I thought that, you know,
  if I got up on that stage and the spotlight was in my face, that
  maybe God would imbue my hands with the power of Stevie Ray Vaughn.
Lauren Reed: So what happened?
Eric Weiss: Oh, disaster. Just embarrassment. I didn't play two notes
  that went together.
Lauren Reed: And what about April First?
Eric Weiss: Oh, we made out in my Gremlin.


# "Alias" (2001) {Resurrection (#3.22)}
[last line of Season 3]
Agent Jack Bristow: You were never supposed to see this.

Lauren: Michael. Please, I need you to understand. When the Covenant
  asked me to marry you, I knew eventually they wanted me to coax you
  back into the CIA. But two years went by and I hadn't heard from
  them. And by then I'd convinced myself I never would. I prayed I
  wouldn't Because I'd fallen in love with you.
Michael Vaughn: Shut up! I am gonna erase you! I'm gonna remove any
  evidence you ever existed! You used me. You used my grief, my work,
  who I am. You took that from me... I'm taking it back. This is
  hydrochloric acid. You'll be unrecognizable.
Lauren: Michael, I swear I was gonna tell you everything. You
  remember that night we went downtown and had dinner? Insead you
  told me Sydney was back.
Michael Vaughn: Don't say her name.
Lauren: She came back and you didn't need me anymore. I could see it
  in your eyes. Sydney came back and...
Michael Vaughn: I said don't say her name!
Lauren: Sydney came back and I lost you. [Vaughn shoots gun above his
  head]
Michael Vaughn: I hate you. But I love Sydney more. That's the only
  reason you're not dying tonight. [Vaughn gets stabbed in the back]
Lauren: Thank god.

Julian Sark: [Lauren is disguised as Sydney] I must say, your
  disguise, it addresses a certain proclivity of mine.
Lauren: If this works, I'll happily make your sick little fantasy
  come true.

Agent Foster: At seven twenty-two this evening, you were logged in at
  the safe-house where Nadia Santos is being held. Is that accurate?
Sydney: It was around dinner. I brought her a sandwich.
Agent Foster: Where were you before that?
Sydney: Buying her the sandwich.

Michael Vaughn: Last time we were together, our roles were reversed.
  Funny how things happen.
Julian Sark: I'm afraid the irony is lost on me.

Michael Vaughn: [to Sark] You like the electric batons, the
  injections... I'm not into accessories...

Michael Vaughn: Ready to talk?
Julian Sark: Yes. When I first learned of your wife's true
  allegiance, I almost felt pity for you. How embarrassing it must've
  been to learn that the woman you shared your bed with was only
  using you as an unfortunate means to an end.
Michael Vaughn: I wouldn't do this, if I were you.
Julian Sark: But then, she wasn't sharing your bed lately, was she?
  She was in mine. Or in my car. Or the elevator. Or a garage. There
  is one time... this is my favourite... we were engaged in an alley
  and she called you to tell you she loved you. [Vaughn twists Sark's
  arm] That woman was deliciously filthy.

Agent Foster: Last week, Ms. Santos was in the custody of the
  Covenant.
Sydney: As a prisoner they nearly killed.
Agent Foster: If Lauren Reed broke in using your identity, she would
  need to be sure you were out of the office. Did your sister call
  you to come see her?
Sydney: If you want to arrest me, hold me under the Patriot Act.
  We're through talking.

Michael Vaughn: [to Sark] I'm not gonna kill you. That would be too
  easy. But I'll leave you so disfigured that when you walk down the
  street people will pity you. Lauren is gonna pay for the damage
  she's done to the people I care about, not for having had an affair
  with you. I don't give a rat's ass who she's sleeping with. So for
  the last time: where is she?

Michael Vaughn: [after knocking Lauren out] Hi, honey.

Sydney: In some twisted way, you've got Vaughn carrying your burden,
  trying to get you closure by doing the one thing you never had a
  chance to do, kill the person who betrayed you.
Agent Jack Bristow: I did have a chance, and I didn't take it. And
  not a day went by that I didn't regret letting her go. Vaughn will
  feel the same way. He will end up like me, and I love you too much
  to let that happen.

Sydney: You were right. Lauren has to pay.
Agent Jack Bristow: Vaughn is going to be okay, and when he is, he
  has to end it, not you.
Sydney: If it's okay for Vaughn it's okay for me.

Julian Sark: [Sydney pulls of her Lauren disguise] This little trick
  of yours means Vaughn failed. Tell me, is he dead?
Sydney: No, he's not. But thanks to you, Lauren won't be so lucky.

Agent Jack Bristow: Let me go instead.
Sydney: I can't.
Agent Jack Bristow: I'll cover for you with Foster...
Sydney: What is it?
Agent Jack Bristow: Nothing. We'll talk when you get back.

Katya Derevko: [Katya tries to shoot Sydney but nothing happens.
  Looks at Sydney, holding the cartridge] How did you know?
Sydney: I didn't. Now I do.

Nadia Santos: When I was drawing, there were moments as the fluid
  wore off. I altered the equation. I didn't want to give you what
  you were looking for.
Arvin Sloane: Which means the Covenant has the wrong coordinates.
  They're looking for the sphere in the wrong place.
Nadia Santos: We should go. We have a long journey ahead of us.

Lauren: [to Sydney] You think the CIA couldn't find you when you went
  missing? Or that you learned what happened to you by chance?

Lauren: [to Sydney] But if your mother has really been helping you
  since she left, why haven't you spoken to her?

Lauren: We're both pawns in the same game. The difference between us
  is: I know who controls me.
Sydney: Who controls me?
Lauren: I guess you'll never know.

Lauren: [to Vaughn] If you love her, you'll put the gun down! [Vaughn
  puts it down] You really are a Boy Scout. [Vaughn shoots her]

Lauren: [being strangled by Sydney] If you kill me, you'll never know
  the truth!
Sydney: This is the truth. Sucks, doesn't it?


# "Alias" (2001) {Reunion (#3.3)}
Sydney Bristow: The truth is...
Eric Weiss: You're insane.

Eric Weiss: [to Sydney] There's got to be something that you had that
  you just loved that it kills you that you don't have it anymore.

Lauren Reed: The risks you are describing have already been factored
  into our analysis. And as for SD-6, the Alliance doesn't exist
  anymore...
Sydney Bristow: Well, the only reason that SD-6 and the Alliance
  broke down is because Arvin Sloane, a man the White House pardoned
  by the way, wanted them to! So do me a favor and don't revise
  history that I lived through!
Michael Vaughn: All right, enough! Sark was an inch away from
  initiating a nuclear exchange, and that was only Phase One.
  Capturing Sark, while it might put a smile on my face, will do
  nothing to shut down the Covenant.

Jack Bristow: How was the first briefing with Lauren?
Sydney Bristow: [sarcastically] Wonderful.
Jack Bristow: I'm not asking because I'm a fan of inter-office
  gossip. Tell me how it went.

Sydney Bristow: All I know is the myth. You know, a women so ugly
  that if you looked at her you'd turn to stone.
Eric Weiss: Sounds like the myth of my college girlfriend.

Sydney Bristow: I haven't even asked anyone how they met.
Eric Weiss: Are you asking me? The NSC was wrapping up the case on
  your mom... uh, we were all deposed... Lauren was the one asking
  the questions. They hit it off.

Eric Weiss: [to Sydney] You weren't dumped. You were dead.

Sydney Bristow: Was everyone there? Dixon? Marshall...?
Eric Weiss: Syd, she's a good person. I'm not trying to rub it in,
  butI... I don't want to be dishonest.

Lauren Reed: We need access to the bunker; Sloane can get it for us.
  If we can use him, I don't see why we...
Sydney Bristow: Maybe you haven't been lucky enough to have firsthand
  experience with that psychopath...
Michael Vaughn: She brokered his deal.
Sydney Bristow: What?
Lauren Reed: I was part of the team that arranged for Sloane's
  pardon.
Michael Vaughn: Look, none of us have any illusions about Sloane. The
  only reason he was given a pardon is because he provided us with
  intel that led to the destruction of terrorist cells...

Sydney Bristow: [to Sloane] You've made your obligations clear, now
  let me clarify mine. I am obliged to extract immeasurable pain from
  you the moment you are no longer a valuable source of intel for the
  CIA. Personally, I hope you don't help us out...

Arvin Sloane: Mr. Vaughn. You know, I remember how close you were
  with Sydney. I'm sure you share my relief in having her back.

Marshall Flinkman: [to Dixon] Uh, you know I was curious. Lyndsey
  briefs the president, right? Well, you think maybe, assuming that
  all this goes well, he could request one of those little White
  House tie clips for me or maybe some peanuts from Air Force One
  because I love peanuts. Uh, you figure they would get top quality
  peanuts if you're, uh, President.


# "Alias" (2001) {Salvation (#2.6)}
Sydney Bristow: You know any jokes? Cause I could use one.
Michael Vaughn: This grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender
  says: "Hey, we have a drink named after you." And the grasshopper
  says...
Sydney Bristow: You have a drink named Doug?
Michael Vaughn: Well I was going to use Phil.
Sydney Bristow: [big smile] Phil is certainly no funnier than Doug.
Michael Vaughn: [big smile] Well, I'm sorry. It's a non-humorous
  joke.

Jack Bristow: Please try to understand what I'm about to tell you,
  Sydney. After your mother left, I tested Project Christmas on you
  because I didn't want you to be a victim. I thought it was my
  responsibility to teach you how to think strategically, to see
  through people's lies, to be as strong as you could be in an
  environment where one mistake could cost you your life.
Sydney Bristow: Then you should've told me the truth before I ended
  up here.
Jack Bristow: Yes, you're right! I never intended you to lead a
  double life. I imagined recruiting you into the CIA after you
  finished college. But Sloane got to you first, and that is a
  mistake I will never live down.
Sydney Bristow: I'd like to believe you, but I don't trust anything
  you say.

Sydney Bristow: When my mom first came back into my life, I wanted
  her dead. So how the hell did I become the person who's trying to
  save her?

Will Tippin: Oh, I got my, uh, thirty days sobriety chip. Even though
  I was ever drug addict, I'm kind of proud.

Sydney Bristow: You're selling your car?
Will Tippin: Yeah, well, it's either that or I quit paying my student
  loans. I can't afford to have bad credit and a criminal record.

Michael Vaughn: Remember the rumour going around the agency around
  the Cold War about the Soviets raising sleeper agents as Americans?
  Now, I know it sounds potentially paranoid, but this is how they
  would do it if they managed to get their test in circulation here.
  They could have contacted hundreds of kids.

Jack Bristow: She pled guilty to keep you from witnessing her trial,
  Sydney, from having you see photos of the agents she savagely
  murdered, including Vaughn's father. She knew if you sat through
  that, whatever sympathy she'd managed to elicit from you would
  vanish, so she cast herself as the victim to compel you to save her
  and guess what? You fell for it.

Jack Bristow: I spent a decade with this woman and another twenty
  years analyzing how she could have deceived me for so long. Trust
  me when I tell you, I am protecting you.
Sydney Bristow: No, you're not. I think you loved Mom so much that
  when she left you, you lost your soul. You know what else I think?
  I think the kind of man who'd use his own daughter to frame her
  mother, who'd test psych experiments when she was six-years-old is
  the kind of man who looks at his daughter and sees his greatest
  mistake.
Jack Bristow: You can't honestly believe that.
Sydney Bristow: It's true, isn't it? If Mom hadn't fooled you, if you
  hadn't been so gullible, I never would have been born. I'm going to
  finish reviewing the mission now.

Michael Vaughn: Look, I know this will drive you insane, but we can't
  employ you because you have a criminal record.
Will Tippin: I have a criminal record because of a drug habit I never
  had.

Jack Bristow: If you're wondering why that man mistook you for your
  mother, he worked for her. I skimmed the research as it was
  downloading. Before she surrendered to the CIA, Irina deliberately
  ordered Sark to expose some of her own operatives to the virus in
  order to study it. Ask yourself if that's a person worth saving.

Arvin Sloane: I had toxicology analyze the glass of wine that somehow
  made its way into my house last week. They found a compound called
  VTX which counteracts the effects of sodium morphate. Sodium
  morphate is the poison I used to... end Emily's suffering.
Jack Bristow: I see two possibilities. Either Emily predicted your
  intention to euthanize her, took the necessary countermeasures and
  is now playing a game with you, or the more likely scenario,
  someone wants you to believe Emily's alive or worse, they'll try
  and make the Alliance believe it, too.

Jack Bristow: [talking about Syd at his hearing] When I look at her,
  when I look at the little girl who raised herself to become one of
  the most extraordinary human beings and one of the finest agents
  I've ever had the privilege of knowing, I see only the promise of
  my own redemption. Turning myself in was the only way I could think
  of to make that clear to her, to prove that despite... my limited
  abilities as a father, I love her more than I could ever say.


# "Alias" (2001) {Search and Rescue (#4.21)}
Irina: I've seen you all my life. In my mind.


# "Alias" (2001) {Second Double (#2.21)}
Francie Calfo: Will Tippin may be compromised.
Julian Sark: Our superiors deal in absolutes. Either he is or he's
  not.
Francie Calfo: The CIA is on a mole hunt to find out who accessed the
  defense satellite communications system. It's only a matter of time
  before they trace it back to Tippin, and then to me.

Sydney Bristow: I have known Will for years. Trust me on this.
Jack Bristow: There's another possibility... that the man we have in
  custody is not Will Tippin. Project Helix. The doubling prototype
  that you destroyed in Poland was designed to reshape a person's
  physical attributes to identically resemble someone else. The
  prototype's database revealed two scheduled recipients of the
  procedure: Dr. Markovic who was killed, and a second unknown
  individual.
Sydney Bristow: You think Will is the double.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: We found Provacillium in Will's car.
  It's a medication usually taken by gene therapy patients to keep
  the body from rejecting the DNA mutations.

Will Tippin: What was that eye scan?
Sydney Bristow: It's a test. It analyzes your retina. Someone who's
  been doubled develops proteins. They're like markers. They found
  proteins.

Sydney Bristow: If someone wanted to set Will up, this is exactly
  what they would do... plant these clues, condition him. I'd like
  permission to assign Francie protective detail. If Sloane is
  targeting my friends, she could be next.
Jack Bristow: Done.
Sydney Bristow: I'd also like to speak to her about Will. She might
  have information that could help.
Jack Bristow: Tell her what you think is necessary, but only what's
  necessary.

Dr. Hans Jürgens: [after being caught in an incriminating position] I
  do not know! I swear to God! Please do not send those pictures [to
  my wife] ! Please let me go! Please! Let me go!
Michael Vaughn: Here's your pictures. [leaves with Sydney]
Dr. Hans Jürgens: Please give me back my pants!

Francie Calfo: [on the phone] I intercepted a DOJ transmission.
  They're moving Tippin to a more secure location. Once he's there he
  will be unreachable.
Julian Sark: Organize a team to intercept the transport and extract
  him. To the CIA, this will confirm his value to us.
Francie Calfo: And once we have him?
Julian Sark: Kill him.

Jack Bristow: You went behind my back.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: That's hardly unheard of in this
  office.
Jack Bristow: So what is this? Retribution for me taking your parking
  space?

Jack Bristow: Sydney, you have to accept the possibility that the man
  we have in custody is not your friend.
Sydney Bristow: Dad, I don't believe it.
Jack Bristow: I understand.
Sydney Bristow: Cause if it wasn't Will then Will is most likely dead
  and I can't handle that.

Will Tippin: Syd, I love you. I can't... I can't trust you. Not
  anymore. Meeting you... meeting you destroyed my life,

Arvin Sloane: [to Jack] I've missed your poker face.

Arvin Sloane: [Sloane joins Jack at his outdoor table at a
  restaurant] It's good to see you, Jack.
Jack Bristow: I assume that since you're sitting across from me with
  so little regard for your life, I'm in the cross hairs of a sniper
  rifle.
Arvin Sloane: Two of them.

Arvin Sloane: I'm curious, Jack. When did our friendship end?
Jack Bristow: The moment you recruited Sydney over my objections.
Arvin Sloane: Ahh. I thought so. If I had known that decision would
  cost me our friendship and my relationship with Sydney, I would
  have done things differently.

Sydney Bristow: You erased it...
Irina Derevko: I transferred a copy to a secure location. I'll give
  it to you. In exchange, I want you to do something.
Sydney Bristow: Go to hell!
Irina Derevko: If you don't, you'll never clear Will's name. He'll be
  tried as a traitor and executed. I'll be calling on you soon,
  Sydney.


# "Alias" (2001) {Snowman (#1.19)}
Sydney Bristow: You know I can't do that.
SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: Why?
Sydney Bristow: Well, for about a million reasons.
SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: I highly doubt there are a million reasons.
  There might be fifty, and I'd like the opportunity to refute all of
  them.
Sydney Bristow: One of the biggest reasons that comes to mind is my
  mother. Khasinau was her superior. My mother was a spy for the KGB
  and those files that we recovered may help me find her. I'm not
  going anywhere until I know where she is.

Marcus Dixon: Noah, I'll be straight with you. I don't trust you.
  Which wouldn't be such a problem, except that I'm an intelligence
  officer and if you stick around, sooner or later, my life is going
  to be in your hands and yours in mine. And in that scenario, the
  only person truly safe will be you.
SD-6 Agent Grey: Mr. Sloane asked for you to come with us.
SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: Well, that's never a good thing. Excuse me.

Irina Derevko: [Sydney is watching the video footage of her mother]
  My Russian or American name?
Alexander Khasinau: Why not both?
Irina Derevko: Irina Derevko and Laura Bristow.

Sydney Bristow: Dad, he was KGB. It wasn't just Mom's death they
  faked. It was Calder's, too. If we can get to Calder, maybe we can
  find Khasinau.

Jack Bristow: SD-6 has run an additional profile on Noah. There were
  anomalies, including recent bank activity which suggested he may
  have ties to K-Directorate. Noah's been taken into custody by
  security section.

Michael Vaughn: Mr. Kishell, I appreciate you talking to me. I know
  this must be very difficult.
Mr. Kishell: I know difficult. Talk is easy.

Jack Bristow: Tippin didn't turn out to be a problem, did he?
Arvin Sloane: Sydney wasn't intimate with Tippin. She is with Hicks.
Jack Bristow: I'm not sure that's my business, and I know it isn't
  yours.

Marshall Flinkman: [Talking to Sydney and Noah] 0.05DBs is closer to,
  like, a sound of a cockroach rubbing his legs together. You know...
  reeeeer, reeeeeer

Marshall Flinkman: Listen, I know I've been somewhat impressed with
  myself in the past, but this time I am, like, freaking out about
  it.
Arvin Sloane: Marshall, could you just tell me what?
Marshall Flinkman: I used a signal lost recovery procedure to examine
  the low-level data sector. I created a raw image ...
Arvin Sloane: Marshall! What did you do?
Marshall Flinkman: I found Valenko. I mean Calder. Well, it's the
  same guy, right? Well, I found him!

Alexander Khasinau: [Jack is watching the video footage of Laura] How
  did you acquire your intel?
Irina Derevko: Every night for ten years I went through his
  briefcase. I eavesdropped on all of his private conversations. I
  planted listening devices on his clothing. He was blinded by his
  emotions. He knew nothing. I can tell you one thing: Jack Bristow
  was a fool.

Sydney Bristow: You're not really going to Banku, are you?
SD-6 Agent Noah Hicks: No. Tuvalu. It's an island in the South
  Pacific. I, uh, talked to my contact. He says now's my window. I'm
  leaving tonight and we could go together.
Sydney Bristow: Sometimes, all I want to do is disappear. Just let
  all this go. And just start over again.

Michael Vaughn: The Snowman. He's been spotted in Mackay. Sydney's
  there, too. He's going after Calder to get to Khasinau. Can you
  think of a way to contact Sydney, put out a warning?


# "Alias" (2001) {So It Begins (#1.2)}
Sydney Bristow: You said you wanted to talk about the plan. I'm
  giving you the plan
Michael Vaughn: It's not your job to give me the plan. I'm giving you
  the plan. Tomorrow's your first day back at SD-6. Now, nothing
  should change. When you get your assignment, you'll detail your
  mission on a paper bag. [picks one up, showing her] Bag. Then
  you'll call this number. [gives her card] Memorize it. After three
  tones, press the appropriate digit - one through six. Each
  corresponds to a trash can in a specific location. Now we'll review
  your information, create a countermission, and we'll contact you
  posing as a wrong number: Joey's Pizza. Any questions so far?
Sydney Bristow: Yeah. Can you show me what a bag looks like again?

Sydney Bristow: I lost my mind a little. I started imagining things.
Will Tippin: Whatever the hell you're talking about, maybe you're not
  imagining it. Syd, this is what I do. I might be able to find
  something that the police overlooked!
Sydney Bristow: Stop it! Please. I'm trying to move on here. I need
  your help to do that. Okay?

Marshall Flinkman: Okay. Who here has trouble falling asleep at
  night, hmm? [raises his hand - the others just look at him] No one
  else does? OKay. Well, anyway, myself, on occasion, I find it
  difficult to nod off - mind racing, ideas, et cetera. So, this kind
  of pertains to the whole sleeping thing.

Sydney Bristow: Since I've known the truth about you, I've asked
  myself questions. Thousands of questions. But this one I have to
  ask you now. When Danny was killed... Dad... did you know? Did you
  know that's what they were going to do?
Jack Bristow: Yes. [Sydney slaps him]
Sydney Bristow: Don't you ever speak to me again

Agent Eric Weiss: Impressive.
Vaughn: Yeah.
Agent Eric Weiss: Balls of steal. That's what I'm going to call you
  from now on. Hey, have you met Balls of Steel?


# "Alias" (2001) {Spirit (#1.10)}
Jack Bristow: I need you to tell me what's happening!
SD-6 Agent: You didn't hear this from me.... While Sydney and Russek
  were in Geneva, a transmission was recorded from her location and
  it was not one of ours.
Jack Bristow: You think it was Sydney?
SD-6 Agent: This is not the first indication that she might be
  working for someone else.

Arvin Sloane: For the past few weeks, you've been under suspicion. We
  knew we had a mole and there were signs that indicated that it was
  you. And then when you were in Geneva, we picked up a third-party
  transmission and it seemed to confirm that you betrayed SD-6. And
  what I just learned is that it wasn't your transmission. It was
  Russek's.
Sydney Bristow: Russek...

Sydney Bristow: n the cell, when Russek was trying to get me to talk,
  I asked him questions about his interrogation. When he told me that
  they threatened to kill him, he was blinking at erratic intervals -
  a classic indication that he was lying. So, I didn't talk only
  because I knew he wasn't in any real danger. Either Sloane still
  thinks I'm the mole and is using me somehow...

Michael Vaughn: [embarrassed] I don't know. I was in this store, you
  know, um... this little antique place
Sydney Bristow: [big smile] What were you doing in an antique store?
Michael Vaughn: I don't know. [laughs nervously] Whatever. Um, look,
  if you don't like it just... don't tell me.

Sydney Bristow: Look, to you, my job might seem pointless and stupid
  but it's not. It's far from pointless and if you knew what I delt
  with every day, you might even thank me for doing my job so well!
Will Tippin: [confused] What the hell are you talking about?
Sydney Bristow: Nothing. I'm going to work. I'll see you guys.

Jack Bristow: Russek. It was a shock.... What? Do you mean did I
  engineer it somehow? No, Sydney, of course not.

Arvin Sloane: ...I didn't know how it would finally materialize: the
  darkness. I had nothing to base it on. It wasn't as if the C.I.A.
  had just betrayed me, that my wife had just been diagnosed with
  lymphoma. None of that had happened yet. So, whenever life takes an
  unfortunate turn, as it has this week, I just remind myself that I
  could see it coming all along.


# "Alias" (2001) {Succession (#3.2)}
Sydney: I'm not gonna... say I understand... I'm not gonna sympathize
  with you and tell you how hard it must be for you... But... You
  wanna know how I am? I am horrible! Vaughn, I am ripped apart! And
  not because I lost you... but because... if it had been me... I
  would have waited... I would have found the truth... I wouldn't
  have given up on you! And know I realize... what... an absolute
  waste that would have been!

Lauren: You should know, in addition to being the new NSC liaison,
  I'm also Michael Vaughn's wife...
Sydney: Hi...

Eric Weiss: [to Sydney] Is that a smile? It's good to see that again.

Eric Weiss: [helping Syd move] You're sure you're okay with this? I
  mean, are you going to be all right? By yourself?
Sydney: I just can't wrap my head around it. I mean, Francie's been
  dead for two years, but I feel like I saw her a few days ago. And
  now that Will is in the witness protection, I can't even contact
  him. All my friends are just... gone.
Eric Weiss: Not all your friends.

Marshall Flinkman: The pickup location The Covenant specified is a
  theater in Munich in the red light district. Actually, it's an
  adult theater. I checked, and today's feature... A rough
  translation, I don't speak German. It's "Penile Code Part Deux." If
  anybody cares, I have the times.

Sydney: Without even knowing why these people want Sark, how can we
  even consider this?
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: We think we know why they want him. They
  want him so they can kill him.

Sydney: Where was I buried?
Jack Bristow: You were cremated. Vaughn spread your ashes at sea.

Michael Vaughn: [to Sydney] The other day you said that I gave up on
  us because I didn't have faith, that somehow you didn't mean enough
  to me.
Sydney: When I said that I was...
Michael Vaughn: No, let me finish. After you died I used to talk to
  you like you were still around. Literally, whole conversations
  about nothing, the weather, shall I get a new car, shall I have
  another drink. And one day you started answering. I mean I could
  hear you in my head like you were right next to me Sydney. I knew I
  was a guy who stayed up nights drinking, talking to his dead
  girlfriend. Still I couldn't stop. So, before you tell me you can
  handle me coming back to the CIA, there are two things you need to
  know. First... is that I was so in love with you... it nearly
  killed me. And second... that I don't regret moving on with my
  life.

Michael Vaughn: [to Sydney] First, I was so in love with you that it
  almost killed me. And second, I don't regret moving on with my
  life.

Jack Bristow: A world relief organization. The sheer audacity of your
  alleged turnaround would be laughable, if you weren't so dangerous.
Arvin Sloane: I was wondering when you'd come to see me, Jack.

Jack Bristow: Personally I would have found it anti-climactic that
  after expecting to assemble a weapon of ultimate power you found a
  revelation you could have acquired from a fortune cookie.

Arvin Sloane: Jack, don't go digging. You won't find anything. I know
  that you were imprisoned for making contact with your ex-wife. You
  went to Irina Derevko for help to find Sydney. Now I wouldn't have
  believed that you would ally yourself with a woman you vowed you'd
  never trust again. So, if you're capable of having such a change of
  heart, why is it so hard to believe that I am as well?
Jack Bristow: Because every morally questionable thing I have done
  has been to protect Sydney. You don't have the same excuse.
Arvin Sloane: Really?

Julian Sark: Sydney... you know how highly I regard your abilities as
  an operative, but... even I didn't think you were capable of
  cheating death once your remains had been identified...

Julian Sark: [to Sydney] If it wasn't your body they removed from the
  ashes, whose was it?

Julian Sark: If I'm to understand what you're saying, you have no
  idea where you've been for the last two years... None?...
  Unbelievable! I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh, it's just... I'm
  speechless. Sydney, if Sloane had intended to abduct you, I wasn't
  privy to it.
Sydney: What if I said I still don't believe you?
Julian Sark: I'd say it'd make no difference. In twenty-four hours
  I'll be free, and... you'll remain in the dark.

NSC Director Robert Lindsey: Who the hell do you think you are?
Sydney: I'm the person who's going to hold you accountable if they
  kill him!
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: Oh, you're going to hold me responsible?
Sydney: Did I stutter?

NSC Director Robert Lindsey: If you're finished, this is the men's
  room.
Sydney: Who let you in?

Ushek San'ko: [Ushek San'ko brings Sark wine] Chateau Patreuse,
  1982... your favorite, no?
Julian Sark: [surprised] Have we met?

Julian Sark: Eight hundred million dollars? I have nowhere near that
  amount in my nest egg.
Ushek San'ko: That, Mr. Sark, you do.

Marcus Dixon: [to Sydney] I want you to accompany the hostage rescue
  team.
Marshall Flinkman: Actually, I had an idea. Syd should go in as a
  biochem major. Harvard dropout, totally spoiled. Maybe she got
  kicked out because she was synthesizing ecstasy in her dorm room,
  or maybe crystal, crank...
Marcus Dixon: Fine

Jim: How long you been back?
Sydney: A little over a week.
Jim: The dreams start yet? Nightmares?
Sydney: Nope.
Jim: They will.

Arvin Sloane: I expect you to trust in the consistency of my
  obsessions.

Jack Bristow: I'm going to bury you.


# "Alias" (2001) {Taken (#3.16)}
Marcus Dixon: The intelligence committee is sending Senator Reed to
  oversee the interrogation.
Sydney Bristow: Why the sudden interest from Washington?
Marcus Dixon: Sark is a key player now. They expect us to bleed him
  dry.

Marcus Dixon: The only thing that we do know for certain: Sark
  managed his escape because he was provided with information that
  could only have come from this office. I want this leak identified.

Marshall Flinkman: I enhanced the audio, and it turns out our friend
  Mr. Sark made a phone call.
Julian Sark: [on recording] Notify the extraction team. I should be
  at the LZ on schedule. Do we have the hostages?... Excellent... Not
  if I see you first, love.

Arvin Sloane: Jack. To what do I owe this pleasure?
Jack Bristow: I take no pleasure in this, Arvin.

Marcus Dixon: The emotional toll this has taken and my current state
  of mind convince me I am no longer the best guarantee of her
  return. Therefore, I am stepping down temporarily as director of
  this task force until this matter is resolved. Jack, I trust you
  will stand in my stead and do everything in your power to bring my
  daughter back to me.

Marcus Dixon: My son said his captors mentioned the word
  "countershadow". That's all I have to go on. I need access to a
  research terminal for an hour or so.
Erin: Not a problem. Mind if I tag along?... Actually, I have to tag
  along. We're at a Code Orange. You understand.
Marcus Dixon: I understand... I instituted the protocol.

Jack Bristow: All of the resources of this agency are being diverted
  to meet demands the Covenant must know are unattainable, which
  leads me to believe it's merely a distraction. What do they really
  want?
Arvin Sloane: Well, then my question to you is: why target Dixon?
  What does he have access to, Jack?

Jack Bristow: The Covenant is desperate to acquire a box constructed
  by Rambaldi. It's Sloane's understanding that they're close to
  locating a key to activate it.
Marcus Dixon: And why should we trust a thing Sloane says?
Jack Bristow: Because Sloane believes the contents of that box in The
  Covenant's hands will put Sydney's life in jeopardy, and I believe
  him.

Julian Sark: I'm afraid I'm going to need some insurance to guarantee
  I reach my extraction point safely. This collar contains a lethal
  cardiotoxin. Once I place this on your daughter, you'll have two
  minutes to disarm it before the compound is released into her
  system.
Marcus Dixon: You son of a bitch! That was not part of our agreement!
Julian Sark: This mechanism is well within your disarming
  capabilities. Two minutes is generous, in my opinion.

Arvin Sloane: Look, Judy, why don't you ask yourself: if I wanted to
  damage you, if I wanted to damage the CIA, would I be so careless?
  Would I leave a trail that so obviously leads in my direction?
Dr. Judy Barnett: You used me. I compromised my judgment because I
  believed that you had changed. You are incapable of it.

Michael Vaughn: See you later.
Lauren Reed: Not if I see you first, love.

Arvin Sloane: [to Dr. Barnett] I found our time together very
  therapeutic.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Abduction (#2.10)}
Francie Calfo: Hey.
Will Tippin: What's up?
Sydney Bristow: Where you been?
Francie Calfo: Okay, listen. Every time I walk into the room lately,
  you guys hush up as if I'm interrupting something. I mean, am I?
Will Tippin: What? No.

Michael Vaughn: Oh, by the way, I'm meeting with Will tomorrow to
  help him prep for his psych evaluation.
Sydney Bristow: Thank you. And I like it.
Michael Vaughn: What?
Sydney Bristow: Your new suit.
Michael Vaughn: Oh. It's not new. I just... don't wear it that often.
  I came from a funeral. Alice's father died.

Julian Sark: You're surprisingly adept at keeping your curiosity in
  check.
Sydney Bristow: Don't flatter yourself.
Julian Sark: I'm referring to the fact that your mother and I worked
  together before I arrived here - before she... went into hiding. I
  learned a lot from her. In some ways, I think of her as a mother
  myself.

Irina Derevko: I don't imagine that means you've decided to trust me?
Jack Bristow: Our previous... dealings would indicate that your
  strategy here may be long-term. So for now, I trust that your
  behavior is predictable.
Irina Derevko: By "previous dealings" you mean our marriage? You
  know, technically, we may still be husband and wife.

Ariana Kane: I'm aware of your reputation as a first-class
  strategist, Agent Bristow. Tell me, where would you begin this
  investigation?
Jack Bristow: With me. Over the years Arvin's trusted me with
  everything I'd need to know to be the perpetrator. And if his
  standing within the Alliance were undermined, I'd be a candidate to
  inherit his seat. Motive.

Will Tippin: You ever have a dream where you're back at school and
  they won't let you graduate because you failed a test? I had that
  last night.
Michael Vaughn: Well, we don't screen for general knowledge. It's
  strictly a psych profile.
Will Tippin: So I can't fail but I can find out I'm a sociopath.

Will Tippin: I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but, um, if
  things go my way, what's next?
Michael Vaughn: Well, you're cleared to read classified documents and
  you get a government salary. Which isn't much.
Will Tippin: Compared to what I make now it's... much.

Sydney Bristow: By the way, I got Francie season tickets to The
  Hollywood Bowl for her birthday from the both of us.
Will Tippin: Oh, great, thank you. You know, she was right about what
  she said. We used to tell each other everything, now we don't. I
  can't tell her anything.
Sydney Bristow: I know. I hate it, too. But after Danny and what
  happened to you, I've accepted the fact that it's as a gesture of
  love to deceive the people I care about.

Sydney Bristow: My math skills may be above average but I can't do
  advanced calculus in my head.
Arvin Sloane: That's why you're going in with Marshall.
Marshall Flinkman: Marshall who?

Michael Vaughn: Devlin made it clear that we cannot, under any
  circumstances, allow SD-6 to access Echelon. And sabotaging the
  mission is too risky after Kashmir. Sloane could start to suspect
  something. We've considered every option, Syd, there's no other way
  to do this. [sighs] When you and Marshall return from London, we'll
  take him into protective custody. He'll be transported to Langley
  for an extensive debrief.
Sydney Bristow: As ridiculous as this sounds, SD-6 is his whole life.
  It's never easy finding out everything you believe in is a lie.
Michael Vaughn: We'll do whatever we can to make it easier for him, I
  promise. And when he adjusts, he'll have the option to come work
  for us.

Arvin Sloane: Jack Bristow is not the man responsible for
  blackmailing me.
Ariana Kane: His answers are too perfect. I mean, he even gets angry
  when it makes strategic sense.
Arvin Sloane: If he had nothing to do with it, I would expect his
  answers to be perfect. Now, Ariana, unless you have evidence...
Ariana Kane: Contrary to what you tell your subordinates, we are not
  the US government. I don't need probable cause to go after Bristow.
  All I need is a hunch.

Irina Derevko: You were right. Although our marital contract was
  founded on fraudulent pretenses, it's still valid until it's
  annulled. Which means, technically, we are still married.
Irina Derevko: Jack. Thus far, I've agreed to be debriefed only by
  Sydney. From now on, I'm willing to talk to you, too.

Sydney Bristow: Marshall has a photograpic memory. Once the files
  flash across the screen, he'll remember them.
Michael Vaughn: Yes, we know that.
Sydney Bristow: I can't just give SD-6 a fake Marshall!

Marshall Flinkman: You know what I always say - if it ain't Baroque,
  don't fix it!

Ariana Kane: I don't trust anyone who doesn't have the sense to know
  when he's being insulted.

Ariana Kane: Men always call women crazy when they're caught with
  their pants down.

Sydney Bristow: [Sydney and Marshall have just talked their way past
  a security post] What did you say to him?
Marshall Flinkman: [nervous] I don't know. I think it was "Go away I
  can smell you from here" in Ewok.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Awful Truth (#4.3)}
Bank Manager: What were you doing?
Sydney Bristow: [in disguise] Just... breaking into your safe?
Bank Manager: [laughing after a brief pause] You almost fooled me!

Eric Weiss: No woman ever wants to go to the Magic Castle.
Nadia Santos: Oh, I like magic.

Michael Vaughn: [Jack crashes the party at Syd's apartment] Looks
  like the party just got started.

Jack Bristow: It must've been lost in the mail.
Sydney Bristow: Your invitation?
Jack Bristow: Unless it was an e-vite. I don't read e-vites.

Sydney Bristow: If you're wondering whether I've told Nadia that you
  killed our mother, no I haven't. But I plan to.
Jack Bristow: Out of spite?
Sydney Bristow: Out of respect.

Sydney Bristow: She's my sister; I need to tell her...
Jack Bristow: This isn't about what you need, Sydney...
Sydney Bristow: No, apparently it's about what you need.

Arvin Sloane: Thank you.
Sydney Bristow: For what?
Arvin Sloane: For letting my daughter stay with you. As Nadia
  acclimates to this life, to a new family... she needs support...
  and you have put my mind at ease.
Sydney Bristow: The thought that I did something that might have
  given you a warm and fuzzy feeling makes me want to kick my own
  sister out of my house.

Sydney Bristow: What are you up to, Dad?
Jack Bristow: They're waiting for you, Sydney.

Nadia Santos: [Nadia was watching Jack and Sydney talk] Is he always
  so cold?
Arvin Sloane: Jack? I'm afraid so.

Michael Vaughn: Bishop also recently purchased an MK-1200 from
  Shalini Tech.
Marshall Flinkman: Wow! You don't buy a server like that to look at
  on-line porn.
Michael Vaughn: [sarcastically] No, you buy it to coordinate
  international business operations, that's what it's designed for.

Michael Vaughn: How do you break into the house of a master thief?
Sydney Bristow: I don't think you do. I think you have to be invited
  in.

Michael Vaughn: Trigger the belt.
Marshall Flinkman: What, you don't want to milk this a little bit?

Martin Bishop: You just rolled your car... you must have been going
  at two hundred kilometers per hour.
Sydney Bristow: Sometimes you need to drive fast.

Nadia Santos: Mr. Bristow, I don't mean to seem impatient, but I've
  never done anything that's lasted as long as this.
Jack Bristow: How sad for you.

Martin Bishop: So, what's your real name, Charlene?
Sydney Bristow: I'm a...
Martin Bishop: I'm a what?
Sydney Bristow: I'm a gonna kick your ass.

Martin Bishop: [aiming a gun at Sydney] I liked you much better as
  Charlene.

Sydney Bristow: [to Nadia] Is that how you normally deal with bad
  guys?

Eric Weiss: Dude, I knew it!


# "Alias" (2001) {The Box: Part 1 (#1.12)}
Jack Bristow: I know how this feels.
Sydney Bristow: Not exactly. You've had a lot longer to make sense of
  this than I have.
Jack Bristow: There was a time when this was news to me, too. Your
  mother was sent to the United States to steal secrets from a
  ranking officer of the C.I.A. How she and I happened to meet, how
  she supposedly fell in love, I thought it was all true. But it was
  just a set-up.

Sydney Bristow: Look where we are. I mean, this isn't real. This
  isn't what we should be doing. I want out.
Michael Vaughn: Out? [Sydney nods] .
Michael Vaughn: You want to enter the protection program.
Sydney Bristow: No. I'm not going into hiding.
Michael Vaughn: If you don't, Sloane will kill you.
Sydney Bristow: I don't think he will.

Sydney Bristow: How could K-Directorate overpower fifty trained
  agents?
Jack Bristow: If K-Directorate attacks SD-6, they know SD-6 will
  return the favor. This team that's invaded SD-6, isn't working with
  any organization we know. My guess is they're working for a group,
  clearly unpredictable and dangerous.

Jack Bristow: Sloane must have activated the emergency failsafe.
  There are five hundred pounds of C-4 strategically placed within
  the substructure of this building. Opening the vault will trigger
  that C-4. All underground levels will collapse, burying any
  evidence that the Los Angeles cell of SD-6 ever existed.

Sydney Bristow: I can't believe, of all things, we're saving SD-6.

McKenas Cole: You're going to give me the combination to the SD-6
  vault and if you don't, I'm going to open this box. And Arvin,
  trust me when I tell you, you do not want me to open this box.

McKenas Cole: You give us the codes, I won't have to open the box
  which will be really excellent for you.
Arvin Sloane: I can't be the first person to have difficulty taking
  you seriously, can I?

McKenas Cole: [holding one 'needles of fire'] Each one is like you
  took a bag of red jalapenos, threw them in a blender, and used them
  for an enema. And Arvin, you're about to get to know them.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Box: Part 2 (#1.13)}
McKenas Cole: I feel like a mom in a shopping mall!

McKenas Cole: Dear person... beating up my men. I assume that you're
  an employee here. I am now standing in Sloane's... tastefully
  minimalistic office. And if you're not here, standing in front of
  me in the next 20 seconds, I'm going to start executing your
  friends, starting with the man that I assume to be your partner...
  Mr. Jack Bristow.

Marcus Dixon: You okay?
Marshall Flinkman: [blood is running down his head] Except for my
  head injury, yeah.

Arvin Sloane: So easy for you to blame me, huh? When you know the
  truth. You got your own men killed. That helicopter was waiting for
  you...
McKenas Cole: I had a man down! I was saving Whitney's life. You know
  that!
Arvin Sloane: Yeah, at the expense of all the other men. Those men
  counted on you to lead them to safety. They trusted their life to
  you and you led them to slaughter.

C.I.A. Agent Steven Haladki: Any irregularities at all?
Michael Vaughn: What, you mean other than a desperate message from an
  agent begging for help?

Eric Weiss: And what if there has been a takeover?
Michael Vaughn: [gets his gun out of his locker and loads it] If I'm
  not back in a couple of hours, I'm probably dead.
Eric Weiss: Good to know.

Sydney Bristow: Dixon contacted you?
Michael Vaughn: Not directly. Through Langley. Said SD-6 was under
  attack. Are you okay?
Sydney Bristow: It's true. There's a team of six, maybe seven.
  They've got the latest military specs. They're after something in
  the vault.

Michael Vaughn: Let's just take this one step at a time. This is a
  charge of C-4. I can tell, 'cause it says "C-4" everywhere.

McKenas Cole: [to Sydney] I know you didn't wanna kiss me, but when I
  was taking a hit off that bottle before, I backwashed in it. I
  mean, like, really big-time.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Confession (#1.11)}
Sydney: He licked my face.
Vaughn: Yes, I understand.
Sydney: You don't really. He licked my face.

Sydney: Dad, can I ask you something? When you started with SD-6, you
  knew that they were a mercenary group and that they had no
  connection with the C.I.A. But I didn't. When I joined, I thought I
  was going to be saving the world and not making it more dangerous.
Jack Bristow: What's the question?
Sydney: Why didn't you say something? I mean, you could have told me
  what I was really doing - damage instead of good - but you kept
  quiet.
Jack Bristow: [sighs] Revealing the truth about what you were doing
  would have required revealing the truth about what I was doing.

Sydney: What happens when someone you care about is in trouble. What
  you said, that nothing else matters. It all just goes away. Last
  week when I learned what my father did for me, sacrificing Russek,
  it made me sick. But now, I know I would have done the exact same
  thing. You should have seen him.
Vaughn: Your father?
Sydney: Yeah, he was like... he was like a pro. He was good. I mean,
  the way you talked about him once, what his reputation was, I could
  see it in action. He was... impressive.

Vaughn: There's nothing routine about that list. There's something
  very specific about it. It's been a mystery within the agency for
  over two decades. Who murdered those C.I.A. officers? I'm sorry,
  but we have our answer now. It was your father. And I'm going to
  report him.

Ineni Hassan: Listen, I have a wife and a son. They are a target. Not
  just SD-6. I've made many enemies in the past. Now, you bring them
  to the United States, give them protection. You do that for me, and
  I'll tell you whatever you want to know. Everything.
Vaughn: Let me make one thing very clear, Mr. Hassan. The extent to
  which I am willing to service you is when I offer you a soda. There
  is no room for negotations. There are no perks coming your way. You
  have nothing to gain here!

Sydney: [from Hassan's weapons storage in Crete] Vaughn, what's going
  on? The room just went into lockdown!
Vaughn: [Back at the C.I.A] What the hell did you just do?
Ineni Hassan: I gave you the wrong code. Your agent has activated an
  anti-intruder device.

Jack Bristow: [to Sydney] Those cyrillic codes you found in those
  books - yes, they were orders from the KGB and yes, they were
  orders to kill. An agent recieved those orders and carried them
  out, murdering officers of the C.I.A., including your father, Mr.
  Vaughn. All this is true. But, Sydney, I was not that agent. Your
  mother was.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Counteragent (#2.7)}
Michael Vaughn: Thanks for getting back to me so soon. Uh, the thing
  is, I think I have a problem.
Doctor Nicholas: I know you're worried, but we ran every available
  diagnostic test for viral infections. Everything that could be
  related to your exposure to the fluid inside the Rambaldi device.
  They all came back negative.

Irina Derevko: [Vaughn has come to ask a favor of Irina] Tell me how
  you feel about my daughter?
Michael Vaughn: That's none of your business.
Irina Derevko: Are you in love with her?
Michael Vaughn: I don't know why that matters.
Irina Derevko: [cutting him off] I don't have the advantage of
  observing casual behavior... I'm curious.
Michael Vaughn: Help me... and I'll tell you what you want to know.

Lab Technician: You need blood from the patient. In this case,
  Vaughn. The equipment that manufactures the serum reads the blood
  and creates a custom genetic-specific antidote for that particular
  patient.
Sydney Bristow: I'll need to take some of Vaughn's blood with me.
Lab Technician: Yes.

Sydney Bristow: Wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute, what's going on? Is
  he going to be all right?
Attending Nurse: We don't know, but you have to wait here. Your
  designated cover: "you're with the state department bureau of arms
  control. Your name is Rita Stevens", give no details about his
  illness.

Alice: The paramedics called. What was his last meal? Is he allergic
  to any medication? I got to the hospital as fast as I could... So
  you work with Michael?
Sydney Bristow: Yeah. We're in the same bureau at state. I'm Rita.
Alice: I'm Alice. I'm listed as his emergency contact. I'm Michael's
  girlfriend. Excuse me.

Jack Bristow: Are there concerns?
Arvin Sloane: Since I was made a partner in the Alliance, SD-6 has
  consistently stumbled in its operations. We lost the terahertz wave
  camera. We failed to retrieve the formula for zero-point energy. We
  didn't acquire Derevko's operations manual.
Jack Bristow: The situation regarding Emily has been a distraction.
  Informing them puts these setbacks in context.
Arvin Sloane: Christophe wants me to meet with him in Tokyo. I need a
  victory, Jack. I need to bring something tangible to the
  organization.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Mountaineer, abort the op and head
  back. We'll find another way to...
Sydney Bristow: Abort? We don't have time to find something else!
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: If you use the machine, they'll know
  you're there.
Sydney Bristow: Then I'll run fast.

Julian Sark: I need access to Arvin Sloane.
Sydney Bristow: Why?
Julian Sark: Because I intend to kill him.
Sydney Bristow: I can get you to Sloane, but only if you promise to
  let me keep the antidote.
Julian Sark: No. Sloane first. Then you'll get back your precious
  antidote.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: What exactly did you promise Sark?
Sydney Bristow: That I would render Sloane unconscious and deliver
  him to Sark.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: So he could kill him.
Sydney Bristow: Yes.
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: There are just so many problems with
  this that I don't even know where to begin.

Will Tippin: Well, how would you explain a question like this, then?
  Why can rainbows be seen only when the sun is behind the observer?
Henry Fields: This wasn't in the test I sent to ETS. I design the
  questions, I proof the test booklets they print up, and then when
  they send the final corrected copies, I put them on file.
Will Tippin: About how many first graders took this test?
Henry Fields: They administered this in thirty-three states. That's
  over five million children.

Jack Bristow: Sloane's on his way to Japan. He plans to stay at a
  Yakuza-run Ryokan, the Nyoshi Ginza. Use the numbers he gave you
  and contact Sark. Tell him we will hand him Sloane the night before
  his Alliance meeting.
Sydney Bristow: Tell me you agree with me, that we have no choice in
  this.
Jack Bristow: Of course we have a choice, and it's a moment I never
  wanted you to face. To kill someone. I'm not talking about
  self-defense: I'm talking about premeditated murder. To be there
  when the door closes on him for the last time. Knowing you are
  responsible. That is something you never came close to considering
  before getting to know your mother.

Sydney Bristow: Approaching the building.
Julian Sark: Good luck, Sydney.
Sydney Bristow: I don't need you to wish me luck, you son of a bitch.
Julian Sark: That's a wonderful attitude.

Jack Bristow: Almost. Sydney got the antidote. The doctors say your
  blood levels are looking good.
Michael Vaughn: How did she do it?
Jack Bristow: She had Sloane killed.

Michael Vaughn: You asked me some questions. I told you I'd answer
  them if you helped me. You did help me. And I thank you for that.
Irina Derevko: I didn't do it for you.
Michael Vaughn: I'm trying to live a normal life... which was always
  hard, given what I do. But it's gotten harder since I met your
  daughter. It's not that knowing her hasn't made my life better. It
  has. But it's also made it that much worse... I think I've said
  enough.
Irina Derevko: The problem, Mr. Vaughn... Is that to the one person
  who matters... You haven't said anything at all.
Michael Vaughn: Listen, this may not mean anything to you, this may
  not be something you understand, or appreciate, but we have rules.
  Very clear, important rules that govern the relationship between a
  handler and his asset.
Irina Derevko: And between a man and a woman?

Arvin Sloane: [to Sydney] You know Mr. Sark.
Julian Sark: I don't think we've ever been officially introduced.
Arvin Sloane: Mr. Sark is now cooperating with us in our ongoing
  search for Derevko and the remains of her company.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Coup (#1.14)}
Sydney Bristow: Did the guy from your office end up reporting you?
Michael Vaughn: Haladki? Yeah, he did. But Devlin only slapped me on
  the wrist. Even though going into SD-6 without clearance wasn't
  exactly constitutional.

Sydney Bristow: I just wanted to rip his finger right off again. Does
  that make me a bad person?
Michael Vaughn: [chuckles] No. But it might have blown your cover.
Sydney Bristow: You think?

Sydney Bristow: Last week, I was ready to leave SD-6 but maybe I was
  focused on the wrong place. I think maybe I only went to grad
  school because Mom did. She was a teacher, so I always thought that
  was something I wanted to do. But now that I know it was just her
  cover, and that it didn't mean anything to her, I'm thinking I
  should just drop it.

Sydney Bristow: Don't start defending your thing with Jenny. She's
  not in your league and you know it.
Will Tippin: Who's in my league? What league? Show me a league and
  I'll buy a ticket, I'll go to the meetings and I will try and find
  those people. Where are they?

Francie Calfo: What's in the bag and where are you off to this time?
Sydney Bristow: Vegas.
Francie Calfo: Vegas! What was I just saying? Where should we go?
Charlie Bernard: After that brunch, Vegas isn't far enough.
Francie Calfo: I'm serious. Baby, that's our cue. We could just go
  tonight.
Sydney Bristow: W-w-wait. This is not a vacation for me. There's this
  public relations conference and
Francie Calfo: Sydney, we don't need you to babysit.
Sydney Bristow: What I mean is I'd want to hang out with you guys.
  Just wait a week. We'll all go together.

Francie Calfo: Was coming to Vegas the greatest idea or what? Hey,
  check it out. There's a wedding chapel.
Charlie Bernard: Aw, come on.
Francie Calfo: Why not? I mean, just think about it. Just us. No
  parents. No hassle.

Sydney Bristow: You and I are friends, Charlie, so you know I have
  nothing against you going into this, but I swear to God, if you
  marry Francie without telling her what you've been up to, I will
  kill you.
Charlie Bernard: Sydney
Sydney Bristow: No discussion. You don't tell her, and I will. Got
  it?

Jack Bristow: When you asked me the other day about school, I
  couldn't help you. I... I'm out of practice when it comes to, uh...
  personal matters.
Sydney Bristow: Dad, I'm in no rush.
Jack Bristow: Believing your mother was a professor may have
  influenced you somewhat but the decision to go back to school was
  yours. And I'd trust that. I think that, uh, if you stick with
  it... you could become the kind of teacher your students will
  always remember.
Sydney Bristow: Thank you.

Michael Vaughn: Yeah. Last week, when you talked about quitting SD-6
Sydney Bristow: I was being naive.
Michael Vaughn: No, but, um, what you said about wanting to go to a
  hockey game... wanting me to be part of your life... I, uh, I think
  I wasn't clear about something. [pause] That it would be nice to be
  in public with you, to actually get to look at you. Grab a pizza or
  go to a hockey game. I-I just... I wasn't clear that I would really
  like that, too.

Marcus Dixon: [Sydney is sliding across a wire on the top of the two
  buildin gs] How's it hanging, Syd?
Sydney Bristow: Very funny.

Sark: [Just after shooting K-Directorate head Ilyich Ivankov, when
  Ivankov rejected his deal] Congratulations comrade Kessar. You have
  just inherited control of the indestructible K-Directorate.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Descent (#4.20)}
Sydney: Don't. Touch. The fur. Alright, you may touch the fur...
  Once.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Enemy Walks In (#2.1)}
Irina Derevko: You must have known this day would come. I could have
  prevented all this, of course. You were so small when you were
  born. It would have been so easy

Irina Derevko: Tell me... Sydney... who sent you here? You must tell
  me.
Sydney Bristow: Or what? I'm grounded?

Dr. Judy Barnett: How did you escape?
Sydney Bristow: I'm sorry, but Agent Vaughn is missing and my sitting
  here telling Houdini stories to a CIA shrink, no offense, is
  pointless.

Sydney Bristow: One thing I have learned doing this: there's no drug
  like adrenaline.

Sydney Bristow: [on the phone with Jack] I'm in the middle of Taipei.
  I just got free. Is Vaughn with you?
Jack Bristow: No, we haven't heard from him. Sydney, you have to get
  to the plane now.
Sydney Bristow: Dad, I have to go back for him.
Jack Bristow: No, there's no time! The Taiwanese authorities will
  check this airstrip.
Sydney Bristow: I can't leave him behind. Hold the plane, I have to
  back to the lab.
Sydney Bristow: Sydney, wait!
Will Tippin: Who's Vaughn?

Sydney Bristow: [on the phone with Francie] Have I heard from Will?
  No.
Francie Calfo: Well, me neither and there's this story on the news
  right now. Will wrote a story in today's paper that wasn't supposed
  to get printed unless he went missing.
Sydney Bristow: What was Will's story about?
Francie Calfo: It's about the murder of your fiance, and some
  conspiracy, and some group called SD-6.

Jack Bristow: [to Sydney] You and I need to assume Dixon's reported
  you. The best move for us is for me to take full responsibility.
Sydney Bristow: What about Will?
Jack Bristow: [to Will] You're... going to have a hard time.

Eric Weiss: Bringing them to justice. I love that - Arvin Sloane is
  talking about justice

Dr. Judy Barnett: One more thing. You haven't said anything about
  your mother.
Sydney Bristow: What, am I supposed to say something insightful? The
  first time I see my mother in twenty years, and she almost kills
  me. Which would have made me the thirteenth CIA officer she's
  killed. She's former KGB. She's betrayed my father. She's betrayed
  me. She's betrayed this country. All anyone needs to know about
  that woman is that she's a bad guy.
Dr. Judy Barnett: I think this was a good beginning.

Sydney Bristow: I'm so sorry. I'm going to shoot you with adrenaline.
  We have got to run.
Michael Vaughn: Uh... don't do that.

Dr. Judy Barnett: So the operation in France must have gone well.
  Your spirits seem lifted.
Sydney Bristow: The doctor said Vaughn's going to be all right, so...
  [long pause] Okay. I see what you're thinking and the answer is
  'no'. There's no line being crossed. He's my handler. Vaughn and I
  have a professional relationship. That's it.
Dr. Judy Barnett: Well, actually, I was thinking about your reporter
  friend.

Will Tippin: I understand that, but you can't think of another way
  than this?
Jack Bristow: Yes, I can think of a number of other ways. But they
  all involve your burial.
Will Tippin: Is that your idea of a joke? You're morbid, Jack.

Will Tippin: [making a statement to the press for SD-6 to hear] My
  problem with heroin goes back three years. I'm embarrassed for
  myself and for my family when I tell you that most of what I've
  written in that time has been complete fiction including my most
  recent report about an organization that I called SD-6. These were
  desperate attempts...

Sydney Bristow: Hey... how's your mouth?
Will Tippin: I think it'll be fine [laughs] . Of course I lose my
  health insurance the same day I need a root canal.

Will Tippin: And I look up and everybody from the office is just
  staring at me. So I left my office this afternoon for, like, the
  last time. I got a lot of, like, "Take care, man." I got a lot of
  that.
Sydney Bristow: I'm so sorry, Will.
Will Tippin: Hey, I'm sitting here. I'm on a couch. I'm alive [sighs]
  . Is anybody listening to us right now?
Sydney Bristow: No. That lamp has a bug killer in it. So we're safe
  here.

Will Tippin: So this is what your life is? Lying to everybody all the
  time? I've only been doing it for a few days and it's killing me

Irina Derevko: Truth takes time.

Sydney Bristow: Thinking of Emily, I often wondered about my own
  mother and what she would have been like, had she lived. Would she
  have been as strong as Emily? As kind, as good? I always told
  myself that she would have had those qualities even though I
  couldn't see them, I simply believed them. But Emily wasn't just
  the mother I never had. She was the mother all of us wish we had.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Frame (#3.17)}
Vaughn: [to Jack] You never respected me; never thought I was worthy
  of your daughter. So I'm not surprised you're so quick to think
  Lauren is betraying me. But whether or not you or Sydney believe
  me, I know the life I am living and I know the woman I am married
  to. Lauren is not Irina. And I am definitely not you.

Vaughn: If I need to, can I crash on your couch?
Eric Weiss: Yeah... you just have to wipe off the Cheese Nips.

Arvin Sloane: In order to maintain my cover, I had to grant Bomani
  access to certain Omnifam resources. Check the report, Sydney. I
  detailed all of this.
Sydney Bristow: You're here because you committed treason by spying
  on your country. I won't put much stock in your reports.

Arvin Sloane: Ah, you have such a beautiful smile, Sydney. I miss it.
Sydney Bristow: If you're executed, I'll be a witness. I'll smile
  then.

Julian Sark: Have you been made?
Lauren Reed: Of course not. If he knew I was Covenant he would arrest
  me, not break up with me.

Lauren Reed: My access extends beyond my husband.
Julian Sark: Perhaps, but Vaughn is central to the CIA's efforts
  regarding The Passenger, so you must do everything possible to keep
  him close.

Jack Bristow: All I have is a paper trail. Not definitive proof but
  the beginning of what Director Dixon and I believe to be a strong
  case for the existence of a mole.
Senator Reed: Other than Sloane.
Jack Bristow: Or instead of him. At this point, that is unclear.
Senator Reed: Is it that hard to identify a traitor? Honestly,
  sometimes I think you people just get too close.

Jack Bristow: I understand this is difficult.
Senator Reed: No, no, it's not, because there is nothing here. Lauren
  is a patriot, and I will not allow you to ruin her reputation based
  on innuendo and supposition!

Marcus Dixon: We've looked everywhere on Earth.
Arvin Sloane: Really, Marcus? Have you? Or is it simply that you've
  looked everywhere on land?

Marshall Flinkman: Okay, now this is what I was looking at. That's
  your basic land mass. But then if I compare the topography with
  oceanic mapping... heh, Sloane is a genius. [Sydney looks at
  Marshall funny] I mean an evil, horrible genius. Bad man genius.
  But still, genius.

Senator Reed: t'd break your mother's heart if she ever found out
  about this. [He shows her the file Jack gave him] . I know because
  it broke mine.
Lauren Reed: If it's any consolation, I feel the cause I'm working
  for is just.

Senator Reed: I could tell the Agency I learned there was a mole in
  the Rotunda six months ago, and that I've been conducting my own
  investigation. I'm a Senator on the Intelligence Committee. No one
  would say a word.
Lauren Reed: You would do that for me?
Senator Reed: Of course I would... I love you.

Kazari Bomani: [to Sydney] I could never have found this without your
  help. I thank you for that... You remind me of your mother. I'm
  sure she would be pleased to know I got the keys from you. After
  all, the passenger is Irina's legacy.

Sydney Bristow: Vaughn, I am sad for you. For you and Lauren. That
  you have to go through this. But I'm also hopeful. That's what
  scares me.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Getaway (#2.12)}
Sydney Bristow: How long have you known about this?
Jack Bristow: I didn't tell you because it didn't concern you!
Sydney Bristow: If the Alliance thinks you're lying to them, they'll
  kill you. That concerns me!
Jack Bristow: What concerns me is having them suspect that you're my
  accomplice. That's why I kept you out of it.

Marshall Flinkman: Actually, um, Mr. Sloane, I noticed you're not
  wearing the tie I gave you. [Sloane ignores his comment and
  Marshall faded smile] It's okay.

Michael Vaughn: Involving you had no upside.
Michael Vaughn: There's no upside to keeping me informed? You didn't
  tell me about Manolo or that you had discussions with my mother!
  You didn't even tell me that you were seeing Alice again!
Michael Vaughn: Wait. What is this about?
Sydney Bristow: This is about me being too old to be coddled!

Ariana Kane: Well, three months ago Agent Dixon reported evidence
  suggesting she's a double agent.
Arvin Sloane: That was a misunderstanding. Dixon came upon Sydney as
  she was executing an operation that Jack had authorized.
Ariana Kane: Yes, I read your report. I think either she was an
  accomplice to his blackmail or else the two of them have been up to
  something more... long-term. You must have noticed that Bristow
  frequently assigns his daughter to operations of his own design.
Arvin Sloane: Sydney Bristow is an excellent agent.
Ariana Kane: All the more reason he would enlist her help.

Eric Weiss: Hey, you sure you don't want to talk about this?
Michael Vaughn: There's nothing to talk about.
Eric Weiss: I share my fights with you.
Michael Vaughn: No you don't.
Eric Weiss: Yeah I do. Remember when Alan pissed in the living room?
Michael Vaughn: That was your dog!
Eric Weiss: Yeah, but I was angry about it and I let you know how
  upset I was.

Michael Vaughn: The nearest Alliance cell is in Zurich. The CIA
  tracks SD-6 security section. There haven't been any signals, no
  movement.
Sydney Bristow: You're serious.
Michael Vaughn: We've been to restaurants and sat near each other.
  We've met in parks and convenience stores, and all of them in LA
  where we are much more likely to be seen. Look, two things... one,
  I think it's not that great a risk and two, I am hungry. I'm
  starving. I mean, we're going to be together anyway, why can't we
  be eating? Aren't you hungry?
Sydney Bristow: Yeah, I'm hungry. [pauses] Let's do it.

Eric Weiss: [Weiss has just prompted Vaughn to finally ask Sydney out
  on a date while on a mission in Nice] And?
Michael Vaughn: We're going to dinner. [Weiss breaks into a
  celebratory dance]
Michael Vaughn: I'm going to keep my comm channel open. I need you to
  monitor the RF frequency.
Eric Weiss: Got it. Okay, in exchange I get an eclair.
Michael Vaughn: No, I'm serious, any suspect signal and I want to
  know about it. Anything.
Eric Weiss: If they're small, bring at least two!

Irina Derevko: There must be a dozen ways to blackmail the Alliance,
  all of them far less elaborate than this one.
Jack Bristow: So we can assume a secondary objective to make Arvin
  suffer. Someone harboring an acute hatred... meaning it could be
  anyone.

Eric Weiss: Did you ever stop to think that the reason you and Sydney
  work so well together is because of the feelings you have for each
  other? [pause] How's that for spin?
Michael Vaughn: Pretty good.

Irina Derevko: You said Sloane requested Kane to investigate.
Jack Bristow: The one person who had an apparent motive for
  blackmail.
Irina Derevko: Someone easy to frame.

Arvin Sloane: We did it.
Emily Sloane: Are you sure? Are you sure it worked?
Arvin Sloane: Yes, my love. We're free.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Indicator (#2.5)}
Michael Vaughn: The Triad? You never mentioned them before.
Sydney Bristow: It's a loose coalition of organized crime entities.
  They deal in mainly drugs and prostitution, but over the past
  couple of years they've made a significant foray into weapons.

Arvin Sloane: In his last communique to our source in Vienna, Hater
  informed us that the triad was engaged in a plot to deploy and
  develop sixteen Next Generation weapons.
Marcus Dixon: Any idea what Next Generation refers to?
Arvin Sloane: No, which is a major source for concern. According to
  the communique, testing of the weapons is ahead of schedule which
  means they may soon be put into the field.

Michael Vaughn: Okay. I'll confer with your father about your
  countermission.
Sydney Bristow: My father?
Michael Vaughn: He didn't tell you? Based on your father's instincts
  in the Madagascar incident, Devlin gave him operational approval.

Michael Vaughn: I don't see why you're denying this possibility!
Sydney Bristow: I understand that your authority has been superceded
  by my father and maybe you feel irrelevant. But he saved our lives.
  Remember that! I won't wait to hear from you.

C.I.A. Agent Craig Blair: I knew about Weiss. How is He?
Michael Vaughn: It was rough, but he's gonna be okay, which is more
  than I can say about the nursing staff.

Jack Bristow: Sydney, Washington has made a decision regarding your
  mother. What she did to you invalidated her agreement with the CIA.
  The government is pressing charges. They're going to seek the death
  penalty.

Sydney Bristow: Sixth grade was an awkward phase for me.
Will Tippin: Oh, come on. You, awkward?
Sydney Bristow: Yeah. Big teeth and little eyes. And I always was a
  foot taller than everyone else so I sort of hunched over.

Will Tippin: When I was in sixth grade, I was sort of anonymous. You
  know, you had the smart kid, and the funny kid, and the good
  athlete. And I was just Will.

C.I.A. Agent Virginia Kerr: We had no idea that the sixteen Next
  Generation weapons would turn out to be children.
Sydney Bristow: They were being trained as sleeper agents?
C.I.A. Agent Virginia Kerr: That appears to be the case. See, the
  best spies have certain traits: proficiency with numbers, three
  dimensional thinking, creative problem solving. These abilities are
  all in evidence as early as five years old.

Michael Vaughn: I saw de Souza. He told me that you hired him to rig
  those explosives.
Jack Bristow: Irina Derevko would eagerly destroy all of our lives.
Michael Vaughn: I'm not a big fan, either. It still doesn't justify
  what you did.
Jack Bristow: You do good work, Agent Vaughn. But your consistent
  shortcoming - you should know this - is your naive sense of
  morality. Evil must be eliminated by whatever means necessary.

C.I.A. Agent Virginia Kerr: Agent Bristow, I've seen your profile.
  Your spatial intelligence is stellar. It's no surprise that you can
  solve the puzzle.
Sydney Bristow: But I wasn't solving it. When I was standing there,
  staring at the puzzle, it was like I remembered where every piece
  belonged. There wasn't any thought involved. You said the KGB
  developed a similar project, it's possible that my mother new the
  techniques and maybe she...
C.I.A. Agent Virginia Kerr: Agent Bristow. If you are looking to
  uncover a trauma then I need to warn you. Hypnotic regression can
  trigger severe nightmares, flashbacks, acute depression...
Sydney Bristow: Understand that to do what I do, maintain my cover at
  SD-6, I compartmentalize a lot. But the idea that I might have been
  programmed to be a spy... I can't tuck that away. I need to know
  what happened to me.

SD-6 Agent Kelsey: There are no fingerprints on the glass. The wine
  is a '99 Hadley Cabernet Franc, unremarkable vintage. What is
  remarkable is what I extracted from inside the wine. I was so
  surprised I redid the test but I'm certain. It's VTX, a
  calcium-based anitdote. Extremely scarce.
Arvin Sloane: Antidote to what?
SD-6 Agent Kelsey: Uh, mainly heart attack inducing toxins. Kertotic
  acid, um, sodium morphate. VTX simulates death, it slows the lungs,
  nearly stops the heart, which is how it prevents the poisons from
  causing cardiac arrest. And then the VTX is, uh, is metabolized.
  The, uh, body, it returns to normal.

Sydney Bristow: I've seen the footage. Mom's briefing with her KGB
  handler. She was sent here for one specific purpose, to steal
  information from you about a project you were developing for the
  CIA. An operation to train children to be American spies. Project
  Christmas. Ever since Mom came back, you were afraid she'd figure
  out what you did to me. You weren't trying to protect me from her,
  you were trying to protect your secret. So the first opportunity
  you had, you set her up... in Madagascar.
Jack Bristow: Sydney, understand something...
Sydney Bristow: No, Dad, you understand something. You took away my
  choices in life. You programmed me to be a spy. I will never
  forgive you for this.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Nemesis (#3.6)}
Arvin Sloane: I miss LA. I miss Emily. I miss the friendship with
  your father. [sighs] I miss your confidence and trust. Perhaps, I
  can get it back someday?
Sydney Bristow: You will never have my confidence and trust... or my
  father's friendship and respect... ever.

Michael Vaughn: It's been three weeks since I learned that Sydney
  murdered Lazarey... I've been lying to my wife for three weeks.
Eric Weiss: Vaughn, I know guys who've lied to their wives for a lot
  longer than that...
Michael Vaughn: You understand that the reason your brother didn't
  like talking to you is because you say stupid things, right?

Eric Weiss: [to Vaughn] Well this is why people from the CIA should
  not get married to people from the NSC. Don't poop where you sleep.

Marshall Flinkman: This guy Lang created this really cool device.
  Basically, take it to any missile silo in all of Russia and it
  interfaces with the launch control console, bypasses all security
  protocols: initiation codes, the commander's launch key...
  irrelevant.
Sydney Bristow: It's a skeleton key for Russia's nuclear weapons?
Marshall Flinkman: Yeah and to be honest, I'm just a little bit
  jealous.

Allison Doren: [to Sark] You look like you've seen a ghost.

Julian Sark: Were you behind them extracting me from the CIA?
Allison Doren: I wish I could claim credit for that. I only learned
  you were working for us recently.
Julian Sark: My tenure began shortly after my father's murder. They
  freed me in exchange for my inheritance.
Allison Doren: Who killed your father?
Julian Sark: I don't know - but I intend to find out.

NSC Director Robert Lindsey: The Covenant doesn't want anyone to know
  they're behind the assassination.
Lauren Reed: And your source believes their reach extends so far
  within the Russian government that they can make that happen.
NSC Director Robert Lindsey: You leave tonight. Any leak, and our
  source could be compromised and killed. That means no one at the
  CIA can know about this, including your husband.

Tupikov: How does a British woman become an American spy?
Lauren Reed: I'm not a spy. And though I grew up in London, I was
  born in the United States. Now that you know my life story, I have
  some questions myself. Your government's running a probe into this.
  I would think you'd want to bring closure to your own
  investigation. Why come to us?

Michael Vaughn: Is it Allison?
Sydney Bristow: Since I learned that she's alive... I keep wondering.
  Does she still look like her? Does she look like Francie? Because
  if she does? As much as I know I should keep her alive to maybe try
  to figure out the last two years of my life? All I'll wanna do is
  kill her.

Sydney Bristow: Why didn't she kill me?
Eric Weiss: Maybe she likes you.
Sydney Bristow: Weiss, I'm serious.
Eric Weiss: So am I! Come on. She lived with you for months. She
  doubled herself as your best friend; maybe in that time, she
  started to like you. I could see that happening.

Arvin Sloane: Sydney, I was very pleased when Dixon said you'd agreed
  to be my handler.
Sydney Bristow: It was an assignment, not an agreement - the way a
  janitor doesn't agree to clean a toilet. But as your handler,
  you'll do as I say, when I say it. I select your assignments; I
  design your missions. I control you, not the other way around.
Arvin Sloane: Is that what you used to let Vaughn do? Control you?

Sydney Bristow: You will set up a meeting with Sark and Allison.
  You'll explain to them that their travel plans have been
  compromised. You'll then offer them assistance in revising their
  arrangements.
Arvin Sloane: And pass the information along to you.
Sydney Bristow: That won't be necessary. You'll be wearing a wire.
Arvin Sloane: And if they discover that it's a setup?
Sydney Bristow: Then I get to hear them kill you.

Marshall Flinkman: You've got the looks. I've got the brains.
Michael Vaughn: I've got the looks? You've got the brains?


# "Alias" (2001) {The Orphan (#4.12)}
Sydney: My father used to encrypt my crossword puzzles when I was a
  kid.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Prophecy (#1.16)}
Emily Sloane: I look just like everyone else and usually feel thst
  way. The fact is, I wont be alive next Christmas.
Sydney: Don't say that. You dont know that.
Emily Sloane: I do. For a long time I ignored the pain. Then one
  morning over there I... I collapsed. I woke up in the hospital and
  the doctor told me. Cancer. He said If i'd seen him in the
  beginning I probably could have survived. But there's a fear, like
  nothing i've ever felt before. It comes over you when you know that
  there's something really wrong. For four months I did nothing, I
  was so terrified of what I didn't know. So terrified that I was
  paralyzed. The longer that went on, the more terrified I got,
  wanting to know the truth but being too afraid to find the answers.

Arvin Sloane: sing all available resources, we have finally tracked
  down the enemy who we no longer have to refer to as The Man. Thanks
  to the surveillance photos you obtained in Brazil, we have
  confirmed his identity. He is Alexander Khasinau.

Michael Vaughn: You're being investigated by the DSR.
Sydney: DSR?
Michael Vaughn: Department of Special Research. And it was created
  during World War II to investigate Nazi interest in the occult.
  After the war, an executive order was signed, empowering them to
  investigate fringe science, uh, parapsychology, remote viewing
Sydney: What do they want with me?
Michael Vaughn: They want to know why your picture is in the Rambaldi
  book. No, I know it seems ridiculous.

Sydney: This drawing is five hundred years old. Millions of women
  have looked like that. My mom looked like that. Maybe it's a
  picture of my mother.

Sydney: You move out of my way or I will make you move out of my way.

Sydney: We'd have to leave tonight. You in?
Michael Vaughn: [shy smile] Yeah. I'll break into the Vatican with
  you.

Michael Vaughn: So, I was thinking, later tonight when we get the
  code key, maybe we can check it out?
Sydney: What, the restaurant?
Michael Vaughn: Yeah. Well, it's almost too good not to.
Sydney: Unless SD-6 spots us there and has us killed.
Michael Vaughn: Well, the food's so good it's almost worth the risk.

Arvin Sloane: Briault wasn't the traitor, it was you... this whole
  time! Our conversations were never recorded. We talked on secure
  phone lines. I made sure I met Briault in secret. You used me. You
  wanted him removed so no one could stand in your way from aquiring
  your special place in the Alliance!
Edward Poole, SD-9: [makes a very wicked smirk] I haven't the
  slightest idea what you're talking about.
Arvin Sloane: [angry and frustrated] Someday, somehow... I will repay
  the favor.

Michael Vaughn: [as the FBI is taking Sydney into custody] Those
  medical tests you took, they were looking to match three specific
  anomalies Rambaldi mentioned: DNA sequencing, platelet levels, and
  the size of your heart. You match all three.
Sydney: So what does the prophecy say?
Dr. Carson Evans, DSR: This woman here depicted will possess unseen
  marks. Signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works. Bind
  them with fury, a burning anger unless prevented at vulgar cost
  this woman will render the greatest power unto utter desolation.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Solution (#1.20)}
Sydney Bristow: But the truth is, it affects me. Never knowing who to
  trust, learning to expect betrayal, plotting in secrecy and hatred
  and anger. It's becoming a part of me. I am becoming what I
  despise.

Will Tippin: I was kidnapped! The lives of the people I care about
  were threatened!
Disguised Voice: It's a bluff to scare you off the story.
Will Tippin: Well, you know what? It worked. I'm off it.

Francie Calfo: See, the thing about rats is they're clever. You have
  to outthink them. You can't really just leave out cheese. You have
  to leave the good stuff. The heavy-duty stuff. The stuff that they
  want. It's the only way they're going to come out. Otherwise,
  you're just wasting your time.

Sydney Bristow: Say there was a break-in at that museum this week. It
  would be widely publicized. Khasinau would start to hear rumors of
  what was taken.
Michael Vaughn: Including rumors of an existing second ampule.

Arthur Devlin: Are you suggesting that I approve the theft of
  priceless works of art?
Michael Vaughn: You see, sir, we would just be borrowing them.

Emily Sloane: When you look back... family, your friends. That's what
  matters. Work, your job. It wouldn't seem that important. [Sydney
  nods a little] . Even your job. Even working for SD-6.

Will Tippin: This is an article I've written. Abby, you've got to do
  this for me. Make sure you keep it sealed, and don't mention this
  to anyone. And you got to promise me you're not going to open it,
  unless something happens to me. And if something happens to me, you
  got to publish it.

Francie Calfo: I'm gonna send flowers to Will for thanking for
  babysitting our rodents. What do you think the card should say?
Sydney Bristow: I had sex with someone.
Francie Calfo: [laughs] Seriously.

Michael Vaughn: Now, when you and Sark meet, you will actually be
  able to test each other's merchandise, which is why we need to give
  him the real Rambaldi solution. After he confirms that the liquid
  is authentic, you'll make the deal, then switch the vial with an
  identical one containing colored water and a radioactive isotope we
  can track via satellite.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Telling (#2.22)}
Marshall Flinkman: Well, post-fish, when I went to drop her off, this
  is traditionally, clasically the time where I would - or a man
  would - kiss her. And, well, I just started sweating.
Eric Weiss: How bad?
Marshall Flinkman: Bad. Weird bad. Freak show bad.

Sydney Bristow: We received a file, a DNA string, of the person who
  was doubled.
Will Tippin: And?
Sydney Bristow: Your DNA didn't match and there was no Provacillium
  in your blood. You've been cleared.

Will Tippin: That file, the DNA string, was there a name attached to
  it?
Sydney Bristow: There was but we don't have any leads yet.
Will Tippin: What was the name?
Sydney Bristow: A.G. Doren.

Irina Derevko: You received my intel. Your friend was cleared. I told
  you I'd want a favor. This is it. 266 Kroner Strasse in Zurich.
  I've just given you the address of Sloane's warehouse where he's
  hiding the Rambaldi artifacts.
Sydney Bristow: That's not why you're here.
Irina Derevko: Yes. It's the only reason.

Irina Derevko: [to Sydney] Stop being as stubborn as I am!

Sydney Bristow: Suddenly you want us to have Sloane's artifacts?
Irina Derevko: Sydney, I know our relationship is complicated but I'm
  your mother. I have to believe that would be the case under any
  circumstance. Go to Zurich.

Julian Sark: Allison... we can't reverse the process. Markovic's lab
  was destroyed. But we're doing everything we can to retreive the
  lost data. And I'm hopeful that we will find a way to reverse the
  process.
Francie Calfo: I may have to stay this way?
Julian Sark: No, no. We'll get you back.

Eric Weiss: Mr. Tippin, I'm Agent Weiss. We're all through here, I'm
  supposed to take you to where you'll be staying.
Will Tippin: Is there a computer I can use here? The name on this DNA
  file, A.G. Doren, I know that from somewhere. I just want to check
  it out.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Based on her Intel we sent in some of
  our finest trained agents, we took control of a storage facility
  and with the help of a bomb squad we're now in control of two dozen
  rusted kitchen appliances.

Arvin Sloane: He had so many brilliant creations. Rambaldi. But there
  was one in particular, a machine. He called it "il dire" - the
  telling. The construction consists of forty-seven pieces. Classic
  Rambaldi. As you know, it took me a long time, longer than I
  thought, but I've acquired them all, including the Di Regno heart
  with your help. They're in the next room, Jack. I have a team
  assembling "il dire" right now. They said it shouldn't be more than
  a day.
Jack Bristow: And then what?
Arvin Sloane: I've seen things recently. I've seen what's possible.
  There's a change coming, Jack. Something even I couldn't imagine.

Michael Vaughn: [smashes Sark's face into a table] See, when I have a
  gun, I don't just pull the trigger.
Julian Sark: Thank you.
Michael Vaughn: [smashes Sark's face again] Where's Sloane?
Julian Sark: Not a problem; my loyalties are flexible.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: If this Intel turns out to be wrong, I
  will personally escort you to Camp Harris and I won't leave until
  you're dead and buried.
Julian Sark: Then I certainly hope Mr. Sloane hasn't changed the
  code.

Sydney Bristow: Get off the ledge now!
Irina Derevko: Sloane believes he's been chosen to realize the word
  of Rambaldi. But you, too, have been chosen.
Sydney Bristow: If you think I'm bluffing...
Irina Derevko: It's you in the prophecy, Sydney, not me. Only you can
  stop him. Good luck, sweetheart. I love you.

Will Tippin: [whispering, leaving a message for Syd] Sydney, it's me.
  Listen, this is going to sound insane but I just found Provacillium
  in the bathroom and I think that... I think that... uh, okay, just
  think about it. I think that the double is Franc...

Michael Vaughn: We thought you were dead. They asked me to come back
  to... to explain.
Sydney Bristow: Come back from what? What are you talking about?
Sydney Bristow: Vaughn... why are you wearing that ring?
Michael Vaughn: Syd... since that night... you were missing. You've
  been missing for almost two years.

Francie Calfo: I just remembered: Francie doesn't like coffee ice
  cream.


# "Alias" (2001) {The Two (#3.1)}
Sydney: Dad I don't know if I can explain what it's like waking up
  and having everything be different. My friends are gone. I have no
  job. I have no home. Vaughn's married.
Agent Jack Bristow: [surprised] Vaughn's what?
Sydney: [hesitating, almost crying] He got married.
Agent Jack Bristow: Michael Vaughn is just a boy who was never good
  enough for you.

Vaughn: We thought you were dead. They asked me to come back to... to
  explain.
Sydney: Come back from what? What are you talking about? Vaughn...
  why are you wearing that ring?
Vaughn: Syd... since that night... you were missing. You've been
  missing for almost two years.

Vaughn: I chose not to stay with the CIA after your death.
Sydney: You're not with the Agency?
Vaughn: No. I'm a teacher.

Sydney: Where's my father? Or... or my mom... have you heard from her
  since Mexico City? Vaughn said Will's alive. If there was a fire in
  my apartment, if he thought I was dead, then how did Will survive?
  Where is he?
Marcus Dixon: Sydney...
Sydney: And Francie... is she dead? Did they find her body, too?
Marcus Dixon: I know you have a million questions, but...
Sydney: I have a lot more than a million questions! I which I only
  had a million questions!

Sydney: You lost weight.
Eric Weiss: I gave up all the foods I enjoy. I'm miserable but I look
  really good.

Sydney: They told me you were charged with resisting authority. Dad,
  I don't understand.
Agent Jack Bristow: I became obsessed with your death; with finding
  those responsible. And at a certain point in my pursuit, I needed
  help. So I contacted the one person I believed I could trust, given
  the circumstances... your mother.
Sydney: You were working with Mom?
Agent Jack Bristow: At the time, she was number 6 on the CIA's most
  wanted list. The National Security Council, primarily... Robert
  Lindsey. You met him?
Sydney: Yes.
Agent Jack Bristow: He discovered that I was collaborating with your
  mother, so he threatened me, questioned my allegiance to this
  country. He chose to make an example of me - an NSC power play. And
  here we are.

Eric Weiss: You're not gonna like my suggestion: you should go see
  Arvin Sloane.
Sydney: What?
Eric Weiss: Sloane negotiated a pardon after your... death. He's now
  a consultant for the CIA. Yeah, he now runs a world health
  organization in Zurich: OMNIFAM.

Arvin Sloane: You remember the Rambaldi device? The machine designed
  500 years ago by a prophet? All I did was bring all the pieces
  together and have it assembled. And when I turned it on, it
  delivered a message, as I suspected it would. I wasn't prepared for
  what it said. The message was just one word, one simple word:
  Peace. The epiphany I had at that moment... suddenly I saw all the
  mistakes I'd made, the pain I had inflicted on the world, the
  people I loved. So I chose right then and there to give information
  to the CIA with which they were able to dismantle at least two
  dozen terrorist cells.
Sydney: I don't know how you convinced the CIA that you're
  trustworthy...
Arvin Sloane: Why don't you check my files?
Sydney: I know you too well. I don't buy any of it.

Bernard: Forgive me if I look shocking to you, but I was believing
  that you were dead.
Sydney: I was. But now I'm not.
Bernard: This is why I love our business.

Vaughn: I came by to see how you are.
Sydney: Are you kidding me?
Vaughn: No, I just wanted to make sure that you're...
Sydney: You didn't come here to see how I am. You came to see how you
  are, because you know what you did. You wana make sure you're okay.
Vaughn: I buried you. Consider that for one second.
Sydney: Don't use rational thought as a defence with me. Not after
  all you and I have seen. Vaughn, you and I live and breathe
  madness. Every day on the job there is no rational thought. I can't
  even pretend to have a conversation about anything else with you.
  What it comes down to is faith. What I was hoping you would say is,
  'Sydney, I gave up on us. I lost faith.' But what you came here for
  was closure and there is not a chance that you are getting that
  from me. I'm not gonna say, 'I understand,' I'm not gonna
  sympathise with you and tell you how hard it must be for you. But
  you want to know how I am? I am horrible! Vaughn, I am ripped
  apart! And not because I lost you... but because... if it had been
  me... I would have waited... I would have found the truth... I
  wouldn't have given up on you! And now I realize... what an
  absolute waste that would have been!


# "Alias" (2001) {There's Only One Sydney Bristow (#5.12)}
Sydney: I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
Will: I know that. Wait, what did you think I was asking?
Sydney: I was just being supportive in case you thought you might...
Will: Die?
Sydney: It's not important. What were you asking?
Will: I was asking you to be my best man.
Sydney: Really?
Will: Yeah... Before I realized you have so little faith in me. You
  thought I was going to die?
Sydney: No! . . You want me to be your best man?
Will: Well I did. Now I'm not so sure.
Sydney: How would that work exactly? I mean, would I wear a tux?
Will: You don't have to worry about it. Because you're not invited.

Sydney: Are You Still Having Fun Anna? You Can't Beat Me
Anna Espinosa: Yet You Still Don't Understand The Game.

Marshall Flinkman: Well, it's a sub-derma device placed just below
  the skull at the base of the brain stem. I've never seen one this
  small before. It's like they patched a radio receiver to a powerful
  micro-charger.
Will: [Sydney, Jack, and Sloan share worried looks] So what-what does
  that mean?
Marshall Flinkman: It means that they-they put a bomb in your head.
Will: What?
Marshall Flinkman: I know, I know. Um... but there's good news. It
  looks like the charge is small enough that the blast will be
  localized.
Will: Waitwaitwait - So it might not kill me?
Marshall Flinkman: No. It will definitely kill you. There just won't
  be any collateral damage.
Sydney: Marshall. How do we get it out of him?
Marshall Flinkman: Well, um, we could perform a surgical procedure,
  but I'm worried there's a gyroscopic fail-safe. I mean, there is a
  very real chance that if we try to remove it, uh... Will's head
  could explode.
Jack Bristow: Get medical in here. I want a full extraction scenario.
Will: What? No! Didn't you hear what he said about the exploding?
Sydney: Will... Calm down.
Will: Sydney, how am I supposed to calm down when there's a bomb in
  my head?


# "Alias" (2001) {Time Will Tell (#1.8)}
Arvin Sloane: Tell me something. How did Tippin get a lead on the
  Kate Jones alias in the first place?
Jack Bristow: I don't know yet, but I'm looking into it.
Arvin Sloane: Well, your efforts notwithstanding, that reporter may
  be a casualty of his own curiosity.
Jack Bristow: I'd consider that a last resort. I know you want what's
  best for Sydney, and if at all possible, we should spare her the
  pain of losing someone else.

Jack Bristow: Lie detector test.
Sydney Bristow: I studied the C.I.A. instruction book on how to take
  a successful LDT.
Jack Bristow: This isn't like that. This test monitors variations in
  blood flow in the brain. It's very difficult to deceive. Tell your
  handler Vaughn he needs to prepare you for this. If he can't, he'll
  get someone who can.

Marshall Flinkman: That sound that you're - you know that boom?
  That's my mind blowing!

Sydney Bristow: Got it. How do I look?
Sydney Bristow: For the record, that's a question you never have to
  ask.

Michael Vaughn: Are you romantically interested in anyone? [She looks
  at him weirdly]
Michael Vaughn: It could be a question.
Sydney Bristow: No, I'm not. [Machine jumps to 56]
Michael Vaughn: Interesting.
Sydney Bristow: Wait, ask me that again.
Michael Vaughn: No, I don't have to. We have our answer right here.
  That's very good. Moving on.


# "Alias" (2001) {Trust Me (#2.2)}
Francie Calfo: Mr. Bristow let me ask you a question. Let's say
  you're hanging out at your favorite restaurant, with your
  friends... or whatever. You like to go there, you like the food,
  what color are the walls?
Jack Bristow: I'm... not really into interior decorating.
Jack Bristow: You know, to the Vietnamese and Chinese, the color
  white means death and bad fortune. [pause] Try red.

Francie Calfo: You know what I wanna do to the guy who introduced
  Will to heroin? I want to kill him. With my hands. I just want to
  kill him.
Jack Bristow: I can imagine.

Sydney Bristow: The idea that the CIA is willing to work with Irina
  Derevko is insane.
Jack Bristow: Worse, it's naive. Your mother didn't just conveniently
  turn herself in. This is all part of the manipulation.
Sydney Bristow: Well, she's their problem now. She's not yours. And
  she's not mine. [When putting on her jacket, she winces a little
  bit] .
Jack Bristow: You okay?
Sydney Bristow: My shoulder's healing, if that's what you mean.
Jack Bristow: It's not, actually.

Sydney Bristow: I don't support the death penalty. I but I hope she
  dies for all that she has done. I really do.

Sydney Bristow: SD-6 and the Alliance believe that my mother's in
  hiding. And they know that Khasinau is dead, and they're correct to
  assume that what's left of her organization is vulnerable. The
  Alliance wants whatever assets they can get their hands on.
Michael Vaughn: So where are they starting?
Sydney Bristow: My mother used blackmail. Extensively. In running her
  operation, she would get dirt on people - powerful and important
  people... and coerce them into doing whatever she needed.
  Pornographic photographs, illegally obtained audio files, names,
  dates, they're all on one computer disk.

Michael Vaughn: [about Sloane's wife death] Killing his wife wouldn't
  surprise me. Eating his wife wouldn't surprise me.

Sydney Bristow: How's Weiss?
Michael Vaughn: He's still in the hospital, but the doctors say he's
  gonna be okay. And until then, I've gotta feed his fish.

F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: Just so we're clear, Mr. Vaughn, I
  know all about your participation in busting Agent Bristow out of
  federal custody. Convince her to talk to her mother, or face
  charges of obstructing justice and harboring a fugitive.
Michael Vaughn: Guess it's two-for-one day on blackmail.

Marcus Dixon: You know, you always do that.
Sydney Bristow: What?
Marcus Dixon: What you just did with your hair. It's your thing.
Sydney Bristow: I don't have a thing.
Sydney Bristow: It is. It's your thing.

Michael Vaughn: You're not the easiest guy to work with, are you?
F.B.I. Asst. Director Kendall: No. No, definitely not.

Michael Vaughn: When she got done with my father, he could only be
  identified by his dental records.

Michael Vaughn: I know you want to see your daughter. I can guarantee
  you that is never going to happen unless she knows you're
  cooperating. Prove yourself. Give Sydney a reason to see you.
Irina Derevko: Sydney? Interesting

Irina Derevko: I've given you a gift and all you get from me is one.
  [Vaughn starts to walk away] . You look just like him.

Michael Vaughn: Respectfully Syd, I don't think your father can think
  clearly where your mother is concerned.
Sydney Bristow: And you can?
Michael Vaughn: I'm trying and she has nothing to gain by lying.

Sydney Bristow: She told me to pull the alarm.
Jack Bristow: Yes, and for all you know, that could've made things
  worse. Sydney, you're smarter than this. Your mother wants you to
  think she's your ally. That she can help you get what you want. Her
  intel might even be accurate once, twice, but the minute you start
  depending on her, she will gut you.

Francie Calfo: Will, what happened to your face?
Will Tippin: You know the one thing they don't tell you about doing
  community service? Sunblock.

Francie Calfo: It's just going to take me six months to get a
  legitimate liquor license!
Will Tippin: So you're hanging out with the Gambino crime family and
  you're giving me grief about doing drugs?

Francie Calfo: I just need a liquor license.
Will Tippin: No, no, no, what you need is someone who knows how the
  system works. Someone who can help you navigate. What you need is
  me. You know, former drug addict reporter... and sometimes lobster
  impersonator.

Irina Derevko: You didn't pull the alarm. I wouldn't have pulled it
  either.

Sydney Bristow: Let's get something clear. You are not my mother. My
  mother was Laura Bristow. Laura Bristow died in a car accident
  twenty-one years ago. You are a traitor and a prisoner of the
  United States government. [Irina looks away, smug] Look at me! We
  will interact only when necessary. You will address me as Agent
  Bristow and answer only the questions I ask. There will be no
  personal anecdotes, no comments about my job performance, no
  condolences or congratulations. Do you understand me?


# "Alias" (2001) {Truth Be Told (#1.1)}
Marcus Dixon: Oh god.
Sydney: I know, if only brother Rama Salaam were still teaching in
  Tampa.
Marcus Dixon: No, not my case work. It's these new headsets - they
  keep pinching my ear.
Sydney: Oh, give it to me. Any word from Declan?
Marcus Dixon: Not since Tehran. I keep telling myself it's alright,
  he's done this before, disappear without a trace- what's up with
  you?
Sydney: What? Nothing.
Marcus Dixon: You've got, like, a glow.
Sydney: I don't have a glow.
Marcus Dixon: Yeah, look at that!
Sydney: Come on, Sloane's waiting. There's no glow.
Marcus Dixon: Is she glowing?
SD-6 Agent Grey: Big time.
Marcus Dixon: You hear that?

Sydney: Write this down. E.M.E.T.I.B. Got it? Now, reverse it.

Vaughn: Any questions, so far?
Sydney: Yeah. Can you show me what a bag looks like again?

Danny: Sir, I love your daughter and I want to marry her. That's why
  I'm calling.
Agent Jack Bristow: First of all, Danny, the truth is this is just a
  courtesy call. Like when you say to your neighbor, "We're having a
  loud party on Saturday night if that's all right with you," what
  you really mean is, "We're having a loud party on Saturday night."
Danny: Mr. Bristow.
Agent Jack Bristow: Sydney doesn't give a damn what my opinion is.
  What interests me is that you do.
Danny: It's just a custom to call the father. That's all this is.
Agent Jack Bristow: Well then, I'll tell you what. I may become your
  father-in-law, that's just fine. But I will not be used as part of
  a charming little anecdote you tell your friends at cocktail
  parties so they can see what a quaint, old-fashioned guy Danny
  really is. Are we clear?
Danny: Yes, sir.
Agent Jack Bristow: Good. Then welcome to the family.

Vaughn: You wrote a lot.
Sydney: I know.
Vaughn: I mean, it's, like, Tolstoy long.

Marcus Dixon: If there's one rule you don't break, that's the rule
  you don't break.

Agent Marshall Flinkman: It's a digital camera. I have it at 42
  exposures, but I wanna get it to 47 because... it's a prime number.

Sydney: You killed the man I loved!
Sloane: No, Agent Bristow. *You* did.

Sydney: I thought you sold airplane parts!
Agent Jack Bristow: I don't sell airplane parts. I never sold
  airplane parts.

Danny: This isn't real.
Sydney: Danny... since my mother died, I always hoped I would find
  someone to give my life meaning. That person is you. I just met the
  agency first. I can't quit.

Suit and Glasses: Who do you work for you pretty little girl?


# "Alias" (2001) {Truth Takes Time (#2.18)}
Jack Bristow: Your mother betrayed us. Betrayed the CIA. Her meeting
  with Sloane was staged to secure her escape.
Sydney Bristow: You don't know that. Sloane could've set up the meet
  to abduct her.
Jack Bristow: Before the operation, she swapped the Rambaldi
  manuscript. She left us with a fake. She and Sloane are now in
  possession of the original. Sydney, they planned this.

Sydney Bristow: My mother's earrings. They found a note she left. She
  wanted me to have them. Just now, when my dad was telling me, the
  first thought I had was that she was dead, that she'd been killed.
  I had this whole thing in my head that she died proving herself a
  hero.
Marcus Dixon: No one can be blamed for trusting their own mother.
Sydney Bristow: I wish she had been killed.

Irina Derevko: I see through you. You must know that.
Arvin Sloane: This is who I am.
Irina Derevko: You may need to think of yourself as an honorable
  husband, a father figure. But I don't. I will never see that man in
  you, which frankly is why we have this agreement.
Arvin Sloane: You need to get some rest.
Irina Derevko: Never talk to me about your love for Sydney again.

Sydney Bristow: You were right to investigate her.
Michael Vaughn: Sydney...
Sydney Bristow: No, it's okay. It's the truth. I'm not blaming you,
  it's me. I was so naive about her.
Michael Vaughn: I don't think you should be a part of this task
  force. Look, you know how I feel about Irina Derevko but no one
  should have to hunt down their own mother, no matter what the
  circumstances are.

Michael Vaughn: Look if you corner her and hesitate to pull the
  trigger, even for one second, it could cost you your life.
Sydney Bristow: I won't hesitate.

Marshall Flinkman: Uh, excuse me, one thing. Did you say that before
  the explosion, your mother called out your name?
Sydney Bristow: Yes.
Marshall Flinkman: Well, why'd she do that? Does that seem weird to
  anyone or is that just me? It's cool if it is just me. It is just
  me, isn't it?
Jack Bristow: Irina may have wanted to save Sydney's life.
Sydney Bristow: I doubt that's the case.

Arvin Sloane: What I'm pursuing, this truth...
Emily Sloane: Truth. Good. Well. That explains it all. I guess you
  and I are looking for the same thing.
Arvin Sloane: Emily, what I'm looking for - among other things - will
  let you live cancer free.
Emily Sloane: I am cancer free.
Arvin Sloane: Forever.

Sydney Bristow: You bought Vaughn a present?
Francie Calfo: Why not?
Will Tippin: Because it's the weirdest thing of all time?

Sydney Bristow: [watching Emily on security camera footage] She's
  alive?
Jack Bristow: She walked through the front door, told the duty guard
  she is the wife of Arvin Sloane, that she wants to cooperate with
  the CIA and that she will only talk to you.


# "Alias" (2001) {Unveiled (#3.18)}
Eric Weiss: You know, Syd, nobody would blame you for hating him for
  going back to her.
Sydney Bristow: He's not the one I hate. How horrible does that
  sound?
Eric Weiss: Well I'm mad at her, and I don't even think he's that
  cute.

Sydney Bristow: My dad thinks Lauren's leaking information to the
  Covenant.
Eric Weiss: I don't understand... didn't Senator Reed confess to
  being the leak before he died?
Sydney Bristow: Yes, and his confessions answered all the questions
  my father had raised. But I can't help it, I still have doubts.
Eric Weiss: All right, let me ask you a question: do you think she's
  the mole, or do you just want her to be the mole?

Marshall Flinkman: [to Sydney and Vaughn] Don't worry because lucky
  for you, I kind of have a name in the hacker community myself...
  [sotto] 'black kitty'.

Sydney Bristow: Are we sure he'll have his computer with him?
Marshall Flinkman: Does a cowboy leave his gun at home when he goes
  to the saloon? Trust me, he'll have it.

Kazari Bomani: This girl, her work for us of late has been uneven.
Julian Sark: The Il Dire machine is in our possession because she
  managed to steal it from the CIA. She is a considerable asset.
Kazari Bomani: [skeptical] An asset for you in ways that do not
  interest me.

Michael Vaughn: Lauren, no one's judging you.
Lauren Reed: I've seen the way they look at me... like I'm a traitor
  too. To tell you the truth, I don't blame them.
Michael Vaughn: People are just angry.
Lauren Reed: And I'm not? He was my father! You have no idea what
  it's like to think you know someone, to love them, and then figure
  out it was nothing but lies.

Cypher: Nice trick. Looks like I'll have to readjust my firewall
  settings.
Sydney Bristow: I could still get through.

Michael Vaughn: What, are you suggesting Lauren framed her own
  father?
Sydney Bristow: I know it's hard for you to consider.
Michael Vaughn: Hard for me? My wife just found out her father was
  betraying her, not to mention our country.
Sydney Bristow: But if I saw her...
Michael Vaughn: You didn't.

Jack Bristow: What about Vaughn?
Sydney Bristow: I've tried talking to him about it. He won't even
  entertain the possibility. It's like he can't hear it.
Jack Bristow: Perhaps he can't hear it from you.

Jack Bristow: I don't regret having married her. I have Sydney
  because of our time together. What I do regret is that once I saw
  signs of her duplicity, once I sensed her betrayal, I chose to
  ignore it. All I'm asking is that you be responsive to the signs if
  and when they present themselves.
Michael Vaughn: You never respected me. Never thought I was worthy of
  your daughter. So I'm not surprised you're so quick to think Lauren
  is betraying me. But whether or not you or Sydney believe me, I
  know the life I'm living, and I know the woman I am married to.
  Lauren is not Irina, and I am definitely not you.

Lauren Reed: [on the phone] What else did Bomani tell you? Did he
  instruct you in the quietest way to murder me?
Julian Sark: Absolutely not.
Lauren Reed: You pathetic little errand boy. Tell Bomani he'll get
  proof of my worth the next time he sees me, when I deliver the
  Passenger.

Marcus Dixon: You recall that I requested Dr. Barnett's notes from
  her sessions with Sloane?
Jack Bristow: Yes. Did they reveal anything?
Marcus Dixon: Yes. There is something in the notes that concerns you.
  In one of his sessions with Barnett, Sloane admitted having an
  affair with Irina while you were married.

Alice: Where are we?
Hatter: The Great Library. There's 5,000 years of history hidden
  here: art, literature, law. Rescued when the Queen of Hearts seized
  power. She'd like nothing more than to see this burnt to nothin'.
Alice: Who are those poor people?
Hatter: Refugees. Those who don't want to be a part of the Queen's
  world of instant gratification. We give them shelter and try feed
  them the best we can, but it is dangerous. If the Queen found out,
  they wouldn't stand a chance.

  quick fix.

Carpenter: ...Short cuts?
Queen of Hearts: [dangerously] How short?
[the Carpenter tries to explain, gives up, sighs, and turns to the
  door. It opens to reveal Mad March, who now has an animatronic
  porcelain rabbit head that was formerly a cookie jar]
Queen of Hearts: [rising from her throne] What on Earth have you done
  to him?
Carpenter: Think of him as a... hybrid, Majesty. In many ways he is
  better than before.
King of Hearts: We don't need a user manual, do we? I hate user
  manuals.
Carpenter: [the Queen approaches Mad March] Uh, not too close... he's
  still finding his way.
Queen of Hearts: [circling Mad March] Does he have all his old
  skills? Forensics, tracking, homicidal mania?
Carpenter: I believe so.
Queen of Hearts: Believe so?
Carpenter: There wasn't much time for testing.
Queen of Hearts: Does he speak? [Carpenter shrugs helplessly] Let's
  try him out, then. [slowly and loudly] Mad March. How are you
  today?
Mad March: [with a mechnical, Bronx-accented voice] Piss... off...
  you... cow.
[everyone looks, terrified, at the Queen for her reaction]
Queen of Hearts: [delighted] Excellent! [laughs] He's good as new!

Carpenter: The time has come Walrus, old friend, to test our many
  stills. The oohs, the aahs, the healing drops, the passions,
  thrills, and to see how joy, and awe, and lust can all be turned to
  pills.

Hatter: Do you know why they call me Hatter?
Alice: Because you wear a hat?
Hatter: No. Because I'm always there when they pass the hat, so to
  speak.

Alice: This?
Hatter: That's not going to come off. Sorry.

Rat Catcher: She's Alice! Tell him who you are!
Hatter: Wow! Really? woooo! Ratty here thinks you're Alice. Of Legend
Alice: Who?
Hatter: The last uhm, the last time a girl called Alice came here
  from your world she brought down the whole House of Cards. Oh yeah.
  Made quite an impression. Although, it was 150 years ago. It can't
  be the same girl. Oysters don't even live that long.

Hatter: Warning. Don't take it on an empty stomach and only one tiny
  little drop at a time otherwise the experience might burst your
  shriveled up little heart. Got it?
Rat Catcher: Got it.
Hatter: Good. Go.

Alice: Oysters were drained? What do you mean drained?
Hatter: Ratty tells me you're looking for someone.

Hatter: Pieces of paper? Pointless.

Hatter: Do I need a reason to help a pretty girl in a very wet dress?
  Oh, I see. You don't trust me. Fine! I am genuinely hurt!

Hatter: [while on a horse together, Alice leans back away from
  Hatter] Are you comfortable?
Alice: No.
Hatter: Lean into me. Let me take the weight.
Alice: [harshly] I'm good.


# "Alice" (2009) {(#1.2)}
Hatter: What are you doing?
White Knight: Down here! Take the second left through the stairs that
  will lead up to the third floor, then after the double doors take
  the third walkway on the right over the Fitness Center to Reception
  B and ask Shiela!
Hatter: Shiela?
White Knight: Maybe its Shakina...

Alice: [holds out hand] the ring
Queen of Hearts: are you mad? I'd sooner have you cut off my finger
Alice: that can be arranged
Hatter: [turns to 10 of clubs] do you have a knife? [10 of clubs
  hands him switch blade knife] thank you
Jack Chase: make sure its a clean cut. We don't want any blood on the
  ring
Hatter: mmhm [switches knife open]

Queen of Hearts: [stomps on reading glasses] Now look what you've
  done! You clumsy club! Off with his head!
Club: [as he's dragged off] N- Nononono! No!
King of Hearts: Bring him back... Tomorrow she'll've forgotten she
  killed him.

White Knight: Alice of Legend, your presence in this world is no
  accident. You are here for a reason.
Alice: Please, Charlie, it's just plain Alice.
White Knight: Just Plain Alice, I will stand at your side, shoulder
  to shoulder, knee to...
Hatter: Charlie! Now's not such a good time.
Alice: You guys shouldn't have come. You could get yourselves killed.
Hatter: Did you give the ring up, Alice?
Alice: Look, I have things under control.
Hatter: You tried to cut a deal with the Queen, didn't you?
Alice: I was getting close.
Hatter: Getting close? Maybe I'm wrong, but negotiations didn't
  appear to be going so well.
Alice: Well, I need more time.
Hatter: For what? You really think the Queen's just gonna send you
  and your boyfriend home?
Alice: No.
Hatter: No, of course not.
Alice: Because he's her son.
Hatter: The prince? Jack Heart? Jack Heart is your boyfriend?

Hatter: What's the matter?
Alice: What'll I do if I get stuck here?
Hatter: Then I'll make sure you're okay. [pause] I think your luck is
  finally changing.

Alice: [they are attempting to escape the casino on flying mechanical
  flamingos] You don't understand, I'm not getting on that!
Hatter: It's perfectly safe!... Safeish!
Alice: I have a thing about flying!
Hatter: [the queen's agents appear and start shooting at them] Yeah,
  I have a *thing* about bullets! Look, I'll do the flying, all you
  have to do is hold on. Look at me. [she does] I wouldn't let you do
  it if I didn't think you'd be okay. [she nods and gets on behind
  him]

Hatter: What's the matter?
Alice: What will I do? If I get stuck here?
Hatter: Then I'll make sure you're okay. [they look at each other] I
  think your luck is finally changing. [they almost kiss, but then
  are interrupted by Jack]

White Knight: How old were you when your father disappeared?
Alice: Ten.
White Knight: That must have been quite a shock.
Alice: You know how kids are. Blame themselves for stuff like that.
  [White Knight looks troubled] You okay?
White Knight: I was ten once. I was ten when the armies came. One of
  three squires to the real White Knight. My job was to carry the
  great lance. And when it mattered, when I was needed most... I lost
  my nerve and I ran. I hid for three days, and when I came out...
  everyone was dead. Even the magnificent Red King up there on his
  throne. At first I wished I died with them, but after a while a
  deeper feeling took over. I wanted a second chance, I wanted to
  avenge them. [tearing up] So I stole the White Knight's armor, his
  name... his courage. And I waited for the right time. When you
  showed up, I thought the right time had finally arrived.

Caterpillar: We're all vulnerable. Mix the wrong feelings together,
  the right kind of bad with the wrong kind of good, and you'll wind
  up with a total breakdown.

[Hatter bursts into the gaming room, and he and Alice take down all
  the agents. She sees the injuries inflicted by Mad March]
Alice: Oh my God.
Hatter: Oh, it's a few cuts and bruises. I'm fine.
Alice: [she hugs him tightly] I thought you were dead.
Hatter: [hugs her back; sighs] Oh, that feels good. [pause] We should
  save that 'til we're safe. [they break apart]
Alice: I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
Hatter: Do you trust me now?
Alice: Completely.
Hatter: Good. Follow me; I'm getting us out of here.

Hatter: [as Alice prepares to leave Wonderland; she calls Hatter over
  to her] I was, uh, I was afraid I might have missed you.
Alice: Well, you cut it a little close!
Hatter: I was, um... guess I was trying... not to think about it...
  anyways, I wanted to say good-bye.
Alice: [taken aback] 'Good-bye'?
Hatter: And if you, you know, ever fancy coming back...
Alice: You want me to stay?
Hatter: Hell no! No, you - think you should go home.
[they share a long look]
Alice: Yeah, yeah, I've had enough of Wonderland for a lifetime.
Hatter: Yeah, I am sure you have, right? Still, we had... we had a
  laugh, you know? Had some good times... obviously, among all the...
  bad times.
Alice: [smiles] Yeah. Yeah, we did. Oh, um... [takes off the jacket
  he lent her]
Hatter: You don't have to... [she hands it back] Brilliant. Thank
  you. That's good. So, we should... [they hug]
Alice: You know, you could always visit my world. You might like it.
Hatter: Yeah! We could - we could do pizza.
Alice: [softly] Yeah, and lots of other things.
[Hatter looks like he wants to say more, but Alice is taken away and
  ushered through the Looking Glass]

[last lines]
[Alice is back in her world with her mother; the door buzzes]
Caroline: Oh, I almost forgot, the construction worker who found you,
  he wanted to stop by and see how you were. Very sweet. [Alice stays
  in her room, looking sadly at her copy of Alice in Wonderland]
  Alice? Come meet David.
Alice: [exits her bedroom and goes into the living room to see... ]
  Hatter! [she runs into his arms]
Hatter: [hugging her tightly] Finally.
Alice: You have no idea how happy I am to see you.
[they kiss. Alice's mother looks dumbfounded]
Hatter: [whispers] I missed you. [they kiss again]

Alice: [holds out hand] The ring
Queen of Hearts: Are you mad? I'd sooner have you cut off my finger.
Alice: That can be arranged.
Hatter: [turns to Club] Do you have a knife? [is given knife] Thank
  you.
Jack Chase: Make sure its a clean cut. We don't want any blood on the
  ring.
Hatter: Mhm.
Queen of Hearts: [angry, gives Alice ring]

Queen of Hearts: Off with her head!

White Knight: Down here! Take the second left at the stairs that lead
  up to the third floor. Then after the double doors take the third
  walkway on the right over the fitness center to reception B and ask
  Sheila!

Hatter: What are you doing?
White Knight: Down here! Take the second left at the stairs that lead

# "Alien Nation" (1989) {Alien Nation (#1.0)}
[a group of human Purists have are protesting the admission of a
  Newcomer student by blocking the school door]
Ms. Purist: They're unnatural. They've already taking too many jobs,
  our jobs! If we let her in here now, there'll be a hundred more
  next week.
Protestor: We don't want them mixing with our kids. Their quarantine
  wasn't long enough. The ACLU got them released too soon. How do we
  know they're really safe?
Ms. Purist: I say we run them back to Slagtown!
[Matt fires his gun and the crowd falls silent]
Matt: Why stop with running them back to Slagtown, why don't we just
  kill them? [fires his gun again] Teach them a lesson. Keep them in
  their place. Keep America pure. [crowd cheers] We don't even need
  to paint little stars on them to recognize them, do we? [cheering
  stops] Hell, they'll be easy to round up. Look at them, they stand
  out even better than the Japs that we threw into concentration
  camps back in 1942. This will be a piece of cake. And if enough of
  us get together, it'll almost seem legal, won't it? Put little
  white pointy sheets on our heads and hang us a few Slags, huh?
  Let's start with this little one right here. [takes Emily's hand
  and winks at her] Just 'cause she's an American citizen, that
  doesn't make her a human being, does it? So what if she's a little
  brighter than some of our kids? We can beat that out of her.
  Discourage her enough, she'll give up. So what if she might have
  come up with a cure for cancer someday? She's not *civilized* like
  us. So why don't we just put a gun to her head and end it all right
  here, huh? [starts offering his gun to the crowd, but no one will
  take it] Come, pull trigger. Come on, take it. Come on! [to the
  rally leader] How about you, Ms. Purist? I know you want to come
  pull the trigger. Get down over here! Come on down! [Ms. Purist
  doesn't move] What, I have to do it myself? Okay. [cocks the hammer
  on his gun]
Protestor: No, we don't want her dead. We just want her back where
  she belongs.
Matt: [uncocks gun's hammer] She belongs *here*. [holsters his gun
  and turns to the crowd] Aren't you shamed of yourselves? [faces a
  black man in the crowd of protestors] Aren't *you*? [the protestors
  and the teachers come out to meet Matt and Emily] Anybody gives
  this little one any trouble answers to me, got it?
Principal: Yeah, I do.
Matt: [to Emily] You okay? [Emily nods] Good girl. Now, go in there
  and show them your stuff. [the teachers take Emily into the school
  and Matt turns back to the protesters] Party's over people. Anybody
  still here in three minutes will be under arrest for the violation
  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

[Susan had gone to Emily's school to withdraw her. While waiting for
  the principal, a black teacher stops to talk to her]
Teacher: Can I talk to you for a minute? I was just thinking when it
  used to be three kinds of restrooms.
Susan Francisco: Three?
Teacher: Men, women and colored.
Susan Francisco: Really?
Teacher: I'm old enough to have seen them. But things do change, they
  really do change if you want them to badly enough. I remember this
  old black woman, Miss Jane Pittman. She used to pass a particular
  water fountain every day: the white folks' fountain. You know what
  she did one day? She went right up to it and took a drink. [laughs]
  But lord, all hell broke loose when she did. "A nigger took a drink
  out of the white fountain. A nigger done this, a nigger done that."
  One became mayor of Los Angeles. One became mayor of Atlanta.
  Atlanta! And one ran for president. One will be president, someday.
  But it's hard to take that first drink. It takes lots of courage to
  be like Miss Jane.
Susan Francisco: At least they weren't afraid she'd turn into an
  insect.
Teacher: Honey, I can show you people today who still think black
  people have rabbit blood and Jewish people have horns. You don't
  look like no cockroach to me. Take a drink.

Justin: [voiceover] The only real freedom I ever got was once a week
  at Rocket Club, which didn't even exist. You see, Craig, Dooley,
  and me just made it up as a cover one time 'cause we wanted to see
  Charlize Theron naked in the movie "North Country"
Dooley: Who told you there was nudity in this?
Craig: Look at her, she's filthy. I mean, eventually she *has* to
  shower.
Justin: [voiceover] Turns out, 'strip mining' was not what we thought
  it was...

Justin: [voiceover] Raja, meanwhile, had decided that if he actually
  *built* a model rocket, he wouldn't be lying.
Salesman: Can I help you, son?
Raja: Yes please. I need some flame-resistant wadding, reinforced
  cylindars, a really long fuse, detonation caps, and a
  radio-controlled timing device or simple alarm clock.
Salesman: Can you, uh, wait right here? [Runs away in a panic]
Raja: Certainly, sir.

Raja: Sir, you should know that you are not going to find any
  evidence of terrorism. But you are going to find some very bad
  things on there. And that is because I used my computer to visit
  naughty websites of naked women.
Franny: *You* look at pornography?
Raja: Oh yes! It is very exciting to me to see women being made to
  flaunt themselves. And sometimes, I imagine that it is I who am
  taking the pictures. That is, of course, after I've tricked them

Justin: No, see mom, cool hip kids can wear that, but if I wear a

  think computers rock.

  Justin gave my mom such a sense of purpose.
Justin: Fine, I'll wear it.

  and play her at backgammon.

# "All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series" (1996)
Charlie: Mars needs weinner-dog brains!

Charlie: Of course, we're angels. What do you expect us to do, dance
  on the head of a pin or something?
Rat: Of course not. Everyone knows dogs don't dance.
Charlie: That's cats!


# "All Grown Up" (2003)
Phil: I wonder what Dil would be like if we never dropped him on his
  head?

Dil: I've got it! A cabinet for people's files!
Tommy: You mean a file cabinet?
Dil: Oh, yeah. Oh! I got it! White sticky stuff that holds junk
  together!
Tommy: Glue?

Tommy: Hey, Dil! What are you doing? Watching the grass grow?
Dil: That blade over there's the fastest.

Tommy: (walking into Dil's now clean room) AAAH! Hm, I've never seen
  the floor of your room before.

Lil: Eew! Phil farted!
Phil: I did not! YOU did!
Lil: Did not! It's biologically impossible for girls to fart.

Phil: Does anyone wanna be my co-pilot?
Dil: Dil, reporting for duty!
Phil: Ok, anyone ELSE wanna be my co-pilot?

Sean: I don't do manual labor.

Sean: Hey, Angelica, do you know if...
Angelica: Would I like to dance? I'd LOVE to!

[Angelica is teaching Chuckie to lie]
Angelica: Plant your feet firmly, look me in the eye, now lose your
  concience. Ok, here comes an example: You're smart, you'll get it!
Chucky: Thanks!
Angelica: That was the example.

Dil: Sorry about the Belt-Quariums.
Tommy: Not your fault Pangborn's a trend-killer. If he'd been around
  when clothes were invented, we'd all be walking around buck naked!

Chucky: I'm fine, really! Who needs to breathe?

Tommy: Well, at least we caught up!
Chucky: Uh, I don't know how to tell you this Tommy, but I guess just
  plain English is the best way. We lapped ya.

Girl: These shoes are stylin', but I have 5 toes, not one long pointy
  one!

[about Charlotte's new face job]
Didi: (under her breath) Remember, we're not supposed to look
  surprised1
Stu: (under his breath) She started it!

Angelica: Teach him to lie? Don't you realize that the ability to lie
  is something you're born with? Like my perfect nose!
Susie Carmichael: See? There's a perfect example.

Susie Carmichael: Did you just brake up with Sean?
Angelica: Teenager means never having to explain.

Tommy: I saw... the bike.
Dil: Is that some sort of secret code? Ok, I ate... the banana.

Tommy: I know what to do, I'm a little concerned that i just had a
  conversation with a poster, but I'll worry about that later.

Lil: It's always Phil and Lil, this! Phil and Lil, that! News flash:
  We're not two heads on one body! I'm a thinking, breathing,
  independent individual, and he's... PHIL!

Angelica: How can I be loved by millions if I play an evil alien? I
  wanna play a nice alien! NICE! Now get that through your thick
  skull, or I'm walkin'!
Tommy: You're right, what was I thinking, casting you as the evil
  villain?
Angelica: That better not be sarcasm.

Lil: [trying to blackmail Phil] Three words, Philip: YOU-KNOW-WHAT.
Phil: Here's my three words: YOU-SIGNED-THIS!
Lil: I! DON'T! CARE!
Phil: YOU! CAN'T! DO! [pause] that.

Chucky: See? Friends are like holidays - you can never have enough.

Tommy: [looking at Chuckie trying not to spill a secret] Chuckie,
  what's wrong with your face?

[about Kimi's new bad boy friend Z]
Kimi Finster: Dad, what happened to the "Don't judge a book by its
  cover" speech?
Chazz Finster, Drew Pickles, Boris: Well, its different now, because
  the book is hanging around WITH MY DAUGHTER!

Tommy: If that's what being eleven is all about, I'm staying ten till
  I'm forty.

Dil: Tommy! You're turning Blechanese! I REALLY THINK SO!


# "All In" (2003)
Min Su-yeon: [Kim In-ha taps her on her right shoulder without her
  knowledge] You've scared me.
Kim In-ha: [smiles] I really loved to give you a shock.

Choi Jeong-won: [when Choi Do-hwan urges him to go to bed seeing him
  drunken] I am your flesh and blood. [bows] I admire you very much.

Min Su-yeon: I think I should have been a princess long ago.

Min Su-yeon: Why did you phone me?
Kim In-ha: Because I want to apologize.

Seo Jin-hee: Kim In-ha is still alive. He's here.
Min Su-yeon: I know.

Choi Jeong-won: How do you want to manage the ISIC Company?

Choi Jeong-won: Do you have any detailed information about the casino
  in Ki Joo Island?
Min Su-yeon: Please wait for a while.

Kim In-ha: [without facing Jeong-won] Although I have withdrawn, I
  hoped you will win.
Choi Jeong-won: In-ha!

Min Su-yeon: [weeping, crying and holding In-ha's hand] In-ha, open
  your eyes. It's me.

Kim In-ha: If you win, what do you want?
Rie: Actualy, I want you to hug me. [In-ha hugs Rie]

Chairman Seo Seung-don: Don't reiterate about In-ha in front of me!

Chairman Seo Seung-don: Kim In-ha wants to take over the hotel.

Kim In-ha: You're eager to give me a chance.
Chairman Seo Seung-don: I believe you're going to win in this game.


# "All My Children" (1970)
Ryan: Do you feel that?
Gillian: Your heartbeat.
Ryan: OUR heartbeat.

Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: Just - I tried to remember when we
  weren't stressed to the max. Our honeymoon may have been the best
  time ever. I was just hoping that maybe tonight we could feel like
  that for just a few hours, let you remember how much I love you,
  how happy I am that I'm your wife, just like that night.
Ryan Lavery: Come here.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: What? What are you...
Ryan Lavery: I remember everything. I remember it was going to be the
  first time that we made love as husband and wife. And I remember
  thinking to myself that my bullet wound was easy compared to
  waiting to make love to you. I wanted you so bad. I want you now. I
  want you right now.

Ryan Lavery: I love you.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: I love you, too.
Ryan Lavery: And I would be lost without you.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: Well, then you'll never be lost.

Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: How long? How long have you known
  that you love me?
Ryan Lavery: Well, I know - you know, I know I've been falling for a
  while.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: You didn't say a word?
Ryan Lavery: I wouldn't let myself, not until I was absolutely dead
  sure.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: That...
Ryan Lavery: That I could love you as much as Leo did. You remember
  that day in the park when you said that you were waiting for
  someone to give you that kind of love, the whole heart kind? Well,
  now I can. My whole heart is yours.

Ryan Lavery: I got halfway to the Valley Inn, and I stopped. What the
  hell was I thinking?
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: I hated that you left.
Ryan Lavery: You're my wife. You're my beautiful wife. I'd be an
  idiot to be anywhere else.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: I love you so much.
Ryan Lavery: I love you. This is where I should be, now and always.
  Come here. Come here.

Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: Did you lie to Kendall about loving
  me?
Ryan Lavery: I've never loved anyone the way that I love you.

Myrtle Fargate: This won't take long.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Why? Because you're leaving now?
Myrtle Fargate: Like hell I am.

[Vanessa cries wolf yet again]
Vanessa Bennett Cortlandt: Darling, please, just go over there. Speak
  up for your poor, defenseless mother.
Leo: Please, Vanessa. You're as defenseless as a cruise missile.

[Leo and Bianca discuss literature]
Bianca: Leo, don't you have any poetry in your soul?
Leo: I've got a few assorted limericks.

[Laura needs Vanessa's help]
Vanessa: You've come to your mother-in-law. How flattering.
Laura: Well, this job requires somebody with no conscience, so
  naturally I thought of you.

[Anna sums up her relationship with David]
Anna: Why ruin a perfectly good situation? We have a lot of laughs,
  don't we, you and I? I slip a mickey. You booby trap me. It's fun.

Marian: You know what they say about one's bed.
Vanessa: One's bed?
Marian: Mm-hmm. You make it, you lie in it. And, from what I
  understand, whenever there is a bed, you always seem to be close
  by, Vanessa.

Mary Smythe: You can't be serious? My daughter is marrying a gigolo
  who's mother is a criminally insane drug trafficker.
Roger Smythe: Well, now, look on the bright side. At least she'll
  have a real reason to hate her mother-in-law.
Mary Smythe: Shut up Roger.

Opal: You could have another heart attack if you're aggravated
  enough.
Palmer: Then leave, and save my life.

Liza: I'll tell you what. Go to hell.
Adam: I'm already there sweetheart. You're it.

Erica Kane: This Trey Shepherd is as cold and as ruthless as they
  come.
Greenlee Smythe duPres: It's about time someone's got in his way.
Erica Kane: Made him pay for all the damage he's done.
Greenlee Smythe duPres: A nice long stretch behind bars.
Erica: No time off for good behavior.
Greenlee Smythe duPres: And a bunkmate, named Bubba, who wants to be
  his special friend.

Simone: [to Mia] Jake's a jerk and Allison's a ho. What else do you
  need to know?

Greenlee Smythe duPres: Why in the hell do you care how I feel?
Carlos: 'Cause when you're happy you're not such a raving bitch.
Greenlee Smythe duPres: Did you just call me a bitch?
Carlos: Raving.

Aidan Devane: I'll go with you.
Kendall Hart: You'd do that?
Aidan Devane: You may need someone to peel you off the ceiling or
  scrape you off the floor.

Erica Kane: You Bastard. You leave her alone. You're so afraid of me
  that you attack a child? You raped my little girl. This man is a
  rapist. He raped my daughter. He violated her. You think I give a
  damn about my company? You Bastard.

Simone Torres: Oh, it's only you.
Greenlee Smythe duPres: You're not the cherry on the sundae of my
  life, either.

Kendall Hart Cambias: No way. A kiss on the boo-boo and that makes it
  all better? How the hell could she be so patronizing?
Ryan Lavery: This is not the time...
Kendall Hart Cambias: No, no, really, how can she do this to Bianca?
  After this pretty little show. She'll have her prefect baby, her
  perfect marriage, and her perfect life, and what the hell will
  Bianca have?
Bianca Montgomery: Kendall, it's all right.
Kendall Hart Cambias: No, Bianca, it really isn't all right. She's
  not doing this to ease your pain. She's doing this to cover her own
  pathetic guilt. Isn't that right, Babe? Isn't that what you're
  doing?
Arabella 'Babe' Carey Cramer Chandler: No.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Oh, really, no? ok, well you know what, you
  don't deserve a happily ever after, Babe, and after everything
  you've done, you will never, ever get it. Your fairy tale will
  crash and burn, and you'll deserve everything you get.
Bianca Montgomery: Kendall, don't.
Kendall Hart Cambias: And when the sky falls, you'll remember this
  day and exactly what I said.
Myrtle Lum Fargate: Time to hide those spinning wheels.
Kendall Hart Cambias: This had to be said, Bianca. You cannot believe
  a word out of that girl's mouth.
Bianca Montgomery: She's my friend!
Kendall Hart Cambias: She's a user. She doesn't care who she guts on
  the way. She's only out for herself. Isn't that right Babe?

Erica Kane: Adam, really. I know that you've been bored, but taking
  in Mary Smythe? I mean, couldn't you have just taken in a dog from
  the pound?
Adam: I prefer pure-bred bitches.
Erica Kane: Well then, you got what you wanted.

Greenlee Smythe duPres: I don't do forgiveness. If you don't believe
  me just ask my mother.

Greenlee: This isn't right.
Mary: What's not right?
Greenlee: Mother, I told you Leo wanted Anna in the first pew.
Mary: The gun slinger?

Adam Chandler: Kings have jesters. Circuses have clowns. I have Mary.

[Opal demands to know where Palmer was the night she spent in a
  holding cell]
Opal: I want to know what you were doing while I was sitting in jail
  fending off the advances of Sheena, the queen of the 5 O'Clock
  shadow.

[Later, Palmer defends himself when Opal suspects he was up to no
  good]
Palmer: Opal, you're one to talk. You really are. First of all, you
  consorted with drug dealers, and then you got arrested for
  assaulting one of them. How could I top that?
Opal: Has your memory receded along with your hairline?

[a semi-hysterical Brooke tries to explain the significance of Babe's
  pregnancy to Tad and informs him that he may be a grandfather]
Tad: A grandpa? Jamie's pregnant? Boy, there's a medical first.
Brooke: This isn't funny. I just had an up-close-and-personal with
  Pine Valley's newest cowgirl.
Tad: Uh-huh. Babe managed to rope you in? [chuckles] See what I did
  there?
Brooke: Stop it. Babe told me that she's pregnant.
Tad: Well, great. That is big news. Why aren't you shrieking at Adam?
  She's married to HIS son.

[Greenlee finds herself in Ryan's bed after a drunken night she can't
  remember]
Ryan: I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page.
Greenlee: (muttering) Forget the page, we're not even in the same
  library.

Kendall Hart Cambias: The last thing I need is to be in Greenlee's
  sights.
Ryan Lavery: You're not in Greenlee's sights. I told you, I had a
  sit-down with her, all right? She promised me - she swore that she
  would play nice from now on.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Oh. OK, so she batted her big, brown eyes and
  you believed her?
Ryan Lavery: You've got to understand where she's coming from, all
  right, Kendall?
Kendall Hart Cambias: Yeah, Yeah, that's easy - Hell.

Michael Cambias: Ms. Kundera can't touch me. None of you can. You
  know what, the funny thing is each and every one of you have tried.
  But your pathetic attempts to take me down have failed. And you
  want to know why? Because I don't stop until I get what I want. And
  that day has finally arrived. My mission here in Pine Valley has
  been accomplished. First, I took over Fusion. Which by the way,
  ladies, was like taking candy from a baby. Then I set my sights on
  enchantment. Mr. Larraby, I look forward to working with you. And
  to complete the triecta, as of this morning. It appears as if Adam
  Chandler can take his retirement to that little trout stream in
  Canada. I'm Chandler Enterprises new C.E.O. So, I'm sure you're
  wondering what that all means for you. Well, it means I own this
  town and everybody in it.

Boyd Larraby: I'd rather fry in hell than work for you, Cambias.
Michael Cambias: Bring your sunscreen.

Greenlee Smythe du Pres: [to Reggie] If I can squeeze past your ego
  I'll get the door.

Simone Torres: Greenlee regrets what she did to you. If you would
  only meet her halfway.
Kendall Hart Cambias: No, not even to direct her the rest of the way
  to hell.

Ryan Lavery: I love the smell of power in the morning.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Well, good morning, Mr. Chairman. Your title
  fits you almost as well as that suit.
Ryan Lavery: And you - you put my billinos to shame.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Well, we are in the glamor business. I try to
  fake it when I can.
Ryan Lavery: You, Ms. Hart, are the real deal.

Bianca Montgomery: Shattered dreams are shattered dreams. Doesn't
  matter how or why. They're still lying in pieces on the ground.

Maggie Stone: I wonder if it's the number of nights that really
  matter. I mean, love, it's more than just the physical part. It's
  whether or not you connect. You can't plan who you fall in love
  with.
Jamie Martin: Well, how do you even know if it's real? I mean, so
  many people fall in love and go through the motions, but it's not
  even close.
Maggie Stone: Maybe some people don't even get to have it.
Jamie Martin: Or they don't recognize it when it comes along.
Maggie Stone: Or when you do finally get it so deep it's a part of
  you, only to have it taken away. You know, when I - when we
  couldn't find Bianca, I experienced an emptiness I've never felt
  before, I mean, like what it would be like if Bianca had never
  surfaced again. I had to put that out of my mind. I had to forget
  it.
Jamie Martin: It's complicated - love. It's so unique every time,
  with every person. And when the real thing comes along, I guess we
  just have to hope we see it.
Maggie Stone: Or hold onto it.

Maggie Stone: So? Isn't this where you do a double take and spit up
  your root beer and ask me if I'm really gay? Even though you know
  I'm the most sensational lover you ever had.

Adam Chandler: Where's Mary?
Tad Martin: I don't know. It wasn't my turn to watch her. Check the
  Linen closet. She's probably in there with some waiter.

Zachery Slater: Hey, maybe you want to talk about something, you
  know?
Erica Kane: Why on earth would I bear my scars to you?
Zachery Slater: Maybe I can help you, be a friend.
Erica Kane: A friend? Oh, no. Please, no more friends, please. I have
  had it up to here with people who have claimed to be my friend. Who
  say that they only mean well and they want to help me and they only
  have my best interest at heart.
Zachery Slater: That sounds like someone who's been burned pretty
  badly.
Erica Kane: Don't shrink me, Mr. Slater. I can see straight through
  you. Yeah, be hind this nice, sympathetic smile is someone that
  wants something.
Zachery Slater: Like what?
Erica Kane: Well, why don't you tell me? You're the one who activated
  your, ahem, search engine. How would you like it if I did a little
  sneak peek into your past, did a little search on you? Everyone is
  hiding something, Mr. Slater. How deep and dark are your secrets?
  Oh, I am very sure you're hiding quite a lot, but you know what, I
  don't care, keep your secrets to yourself. The last thing I need in
  this world is another so-called friend that I should trust my life
  with, because it only dead-ends in betrayal.

Ryan Lavery: You want to tell me what the hell you were trying to
  pull out there?
Kendall Hart Cambias: Did you see Babe? Did you just see what she
  did? She has the nerve to offer a consolation prize, honorary
  mommy? What the hell is that? I mean, what could Bianca possibly do
  with that? Sit and watch Babe be the mother that Bianca will never
  get to be? It's stupid. It reeks.
Ryan Lavery: Babe was just trying to help.
Kendall Hart Cambias: No, Babe was trying to cover her own butt and
  make herself look good. She was trying to show what a big heart she
  has so no one will know what a liar she really is.
Ryan Lavery: What? Where do you get this stuff?
Kendall Hart Cambias: Oh, please don't tell me you can't see it,
  Ryan, come on. Babe is all about playing the bimbo matriarch of the
  Chandler clan. When really she a selfish, lying, stupid little
  bitch.

Kendall Hart Cambias: No, the big diva has not song yet. Ryan and I
  are not over.
Bianca Montgomery: Hello? Ryan is not here. Ryan left with his wife.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Oh, so what? That's just a pesky little detail.
  It doesn't matter. And, hey, aren't you the cheerleader who told me
  to go after Ryan and never give up on love?
Bianca Montgomery: That was before Ryan put a ring on Greenlee's
  finger.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Details - blah, blah, blah. Forget them. Just
  focus on the big picture and never lose heart, because I know in
  mine - I know in my heart, Bianca, I'm right. I know I'm right.
  Ryan doesn't want to give up on me any more than our mother wants
  to give up popping champagne corks.

Bianca Montgomery: Kendall, we're bordering on obsession here. I mean
  it. Simone told me that you locked Greenlee in a castle tower. You
  threw Ryan the most awkward wedding party ever, that totally freak
  out the guest. You put a curse on Babe at her baby's christening.
  For God's sakes, Kendall, I'm scared what's next.

Erica: Pine Valley isn't exactly the corner of Hollywood and Vine.

Maggie Stone: Remember when we kissed? Or when I kissed you?
Bianca Montgomery: It's kind of hard to forget.
Maggie Stone: And I, blew it off, like it didn't mean anything.
Bianca Montgomery: Yeah.
Maggie Stone: It was a big fat lie. That kiss, and that whole moment,
  hasn't left me yet. And I think about it, and I think about you,
  and I think about doing it again. Bianca, I think I love you.

Bianca Montgomery: I'm not gonna give you the lesbian pop quiz...
  yet. [pause] I'm kidding.

Jamie Martin: What have I always said?
Maggie Stone: [unison] "You've got to be in it to win it."

Maggie Stone: I feel like I've been thrown into the deep end and I
  don't know how to swim.
Bianca Montgomery: There's a lifeguard on duty.

Maggie Stone: I mean I swore to you I wasn't gay. I told you that I
  loved you, just not 'like that.' And now here I am telling you that
  I do love you like that... I think. I don't know. Can you please
  tell me again how did you know that you were gay?
Bianca Montgomery: Well, it wasn't like somebody flipped a switch. I
  think I always knew somewhere deep inside. I just didn't want to
  admit it, deal with it. I mean come on, how could Erica Kane's
  daughter be a lesbian, right? And then finally I did admit it to
  myself, who I was and I accepted it.
Maggie Stone: I just wish I knew what that meant. Accepting what?
  Admitting what? Am I gay? Or is it just you? Am I a straight girl
  who has a crush on a gay friend? Or am I gay and sleeping with guys
  to prove that I'm not?

Erica Kane: [indicating Adam] Oh, this isn't my friend; this is my
  ex-husband.
Adam Chandler: One of many. I'm third from the end - at least, I
  think so; I haven't seen Erica for a couple of days.

Opal: [to Myrtle about Erica] Somebody give me a stick so I can beat
  the stupid out of her.

Greenlee Smythe duPres: [to Ryan] I just saw Darth Chandler and his
  son steam out of here dragging their forked tails behind them.

Erica Kane: You slept with Ryan's brother before you stole the
  company out from under him?
Kendall Hart Cambias: No, no, I didn't steal it, I didn't steal it.
  Adam and J.R. did. Ok, but here's the kicker - Ryan tried to
  convince me earlier today that he's completely over me for good,
  which, of course, that can't be. I mean, it's impossible, and we
  are going to prove that. And you know what's so great about you and
  I doing this together is that you hate Greenlee just as much as I
  do, so it's perfect! Plus, mother, you are the queen of creativity.
  You're so creative. I mean, the truth is i'm running out of ideas,
  but the two of us putting our heads together could be so amazing!
Erica Kane: Kendall, you have to stop. You're talking like a crazy
  person.

Ryan: Kendall can't hurt us anymore.
Greenlee Smythe duPres: As long as she's breathing and jealous, she
  can sabotage Fusion.
Ryan: Not for long.
Simone Torres: That is why I am offering myself up for the good of
  the company. Put me in charge of the Enchantment Signature perfume
  project.
Ryan: You want to work with Jonathan. Yes, I'll consider that.
Simone Torres: Say the word and I am on him... it.

Erica Kane: Getting back at Ryan isn't the answer.
Kendall Hart Cambias: No? Ok. All right, fine. Honestly, tell me
  this... if your father were still alive, standing here right now,
  what would you do?
Erica Kane: I'd kill him! But you can't equate Ryan with my father.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Ok, well, yes, I agree the crimes were
  completely different, but the result was pain. Someone hurts you,
  you make them suffer.
Erica Kane: Well, you wanted me to suffer once. You remember how that
  turned out.
Kendall Hart Cambias: Yes, but I was a kid. Now I know what I'm
  doing. I know what I'm doing and I love it. There is nothing more
  satisfying than paying back hurt for hurt. It's ok, mother, you
  don't have to worry about me.
Erica Kane: No, I'm scared for you, Kendall. I'm scared for all of
  us. I'm scared for you and Bianca and myself.

Jesse Hubbard: [to Tad] Don't make me slap you. 'Cause I will lump
  you up.

Kendall Hart Cambias: [on Zach being at the fundraiser] What, you
  think I brought him here just to spite you?
Ryan Lavery: Now, wouldn't that be a shocker?
Kendall Hart Cambias: Ok, and I guess you're the reason that I had a
  cappuccino today. See, I think you're confusing me with your little
  pet kitty Greenlee.

Tad Martin: The next sound you hear will be my head exploding.

Opal: I don't believe it. You purposely cut me off in the driveway.
Palmer Cortlandt: Well it's not my fault if you drive with one foot
  on the brake and one foot in the grave.

[after Jamie leaves]
Brooke Allison English #2: I should feel better. Shouldn't I?
Tad Martin: I couldn't tell you. I just had an out of body
  experience. I swear I just watched myself walk out the door 20
  years ago headed straight for trouble.

Dr. David Hayward: [to Adam] I'd rather spend time in prison with
  Bubba and his all-boy band than to watch you mangle another child's
  life.

Dr. Maria Santos Grey: You know, usually evil gatekeepers are
  three-headed dogs, not two-faced bitches.

Braden Lavery: Let me get this straight. You want me to seduce your
  niece.
Palmer Cortlandt: Well, that's putting it a little indelicately. I'd
  much prefer "court" or "romance", but whatever.

Vanessa Bennett Cortlandt: Palmer, come on. It's a perfectly
  understandable concern. I mean, nobody knows what the future will
  hold. A meteor could drop on the Valley Inn tonight and kill us
  all.
Palmer Cortlandt: Well, that's a cheery thought.
Vanessa Bennett Cortlandt: Oh. And what would happen to Leo then?
Palmer Cortlandt: Well, he'd be dead. I mean, a meteor, you know.

Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: Simone, I need you to do something
  illegal for me.
Simone Torres: Well, if you keep posting my bail, I'm your puppet.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: I need you to steal something for me.
Simone Torres: What is it ?
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: My husband's sperm.

Simone Torres: You know no-one is going to buy it. I would never need
  to be artificially inseminated. You know this could decimate my
  love life. Not to mention my threshhold for pain is like
  non-existent. I practically passed out when you stomped on my foot!
  I can't survive childbirth!
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: [from the bedroom] Just because
  you're being inseminated doesn't mean you're having the baby.
Simone Torres: Get in here and explain that. I'm definitely gonna
  need you to draw pictures.
Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery: Brace yourself!

Kendall Hart Lang Slater: What's so important that you can't

Zachery Slater: I'm rearranging my sock drawer.
Kendall Hart Lang Slater: Yeah.
Zachery Slater: No, it's serious business. I mean, I've got the gym
  socks touching the dress socks. It's a real mess. Anyway, we've got

Zarf: Retro?
Josh Madden: Retro is where it's at. If you'd look at the papers I
  gave you, you'll see the key demographics are 16 to 25 year old

Mike Stivic: I just thank God I'm an atheist.

[Describing a nightmare he had regarding organ donation]
Archie Bunker: My hands was pickin' pockets... my feet was runnin'
  away from bank robberies... and my eyes was lookin' at hard pore
  cornography.

Mike Stivic: Hey it just occurred to me, Mickey Mouse is black.
Archie Bunker: Mickey Mouse ain't got no race. He represents all men.
Mike Stivic: Oh, I guess that's why Walt made him a mouse.

Mike Stivic: You know, you are totally incomprehensible.
Archie Bunker: Maybe so, but I make a lot of sense.

Mike Stivic: Why couldn't they say "Buddha, bless you" in Chinese?
Archie Bunker: Because they don't say that, that's why. If they
  say... Well, if they say anything at all, it's "Sayonara".
Mike Stivic: That's Japanese.
Archie Bunker: Same thing.
Mike Stivic: It's not the same thing!
Archie Bunker: What are you talking about? You put a Jap and a Chink
  together, you gonna tell me which is which?
Mike Stivic: That's right, because I find out about them. I talk to
  them as individuals.
Archie Bunker: Sure you talk to them. You say, "Which one of you guys
  is the Chink?"
Mike Stivic: [yells] I don't believe this. He's making me crazy!

Archie Bunker: You are SICK, you know that? YOU NEED HELP. I've
  listened to this guy around here for ten months. All this pinko
  stuff, that's all right, that's what they're fillin' 'em up with in
  the schools nowadays, huh? The clothes, well, that's all right,
  they take from each other, one kid looks crummier than the next.
  Their wide-open sex any time of the day or night for no reason at
  all, that's all right, that's their submissive society. But when he
  goes besmearing - when he goes besmearing the name of a great
  line-backer, a second-choice all-American, a man, and I mean a REAL
  MAN, THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL SHUT THE DOORS OF THIS COUNTRY AND HANG
  UP A SIGN, "CLOSED. OWNER GONE NUTS".

Archie: Whatever happened to the good old days when kids was scared
  to death of their parents?

Edith Bunker: What's wrong, Archie?
Mike Stivic: It's just indigestion. It comes from eating his own
  words.

Edith Bunker: We should take you to the doctor.
Archie Bunker: No, I've already had one attempted robbery today.

Archie Bunker: I got bigger fish to fly.

Archie: I'm gonna go into town and get me a good Jew lawyer.
Mike Stivic: Do you always have to label people? Why can't you just
  get a lawyer. Why does it have to be a Jewish lawyer?
Archie: Because if I'm going to sue an "A-rab," I want a guy that's
  full o' hate!

Archie Bunker: Don't bother the U.S.A Government with the
  Constitution.
Mike Stivic: Why? Afraid they're gonna read it?

Archie: God created the universe in seven days.
Edith: Six days. On the seventh day he rested.
Archie: Well only for a while then He looked over what He done.

Archie: Where's my grandson?

Gloria Stivic: Daddy, what I don't understand is how can the Duke be
  alive if he threw himself on a grenade?
Archie Bunker: 'Cause it was an Italian grenade. It was a dud like
  everything else them Pasta-Fazoos made.

Gloria: You know, pizza's actually not from Italy. I read that Marco
  Polo discovered it in China and then brought it back to Italy.
Archie: Leave it to a dago to go halfway around the world to get a
  take-home meal.

Archie Bunker: What she done was wrong and she gotta be punished. For
  the next two weeks, no out after school. No out at all. If you find
  yourself having fun at something, stop it. And no delicious foods
  for three weeks. You only gotta eat the terrible foods that are
  good for you. And then no TV for a week. And the next week, and
  this is gonna be tougher: educational TV only.

Edith: Can or bottle?
Archie: We never buy bottles.

Archie: Your honor, may I encroach the bench?

Archie: Bingo. Start collecting the garbage off of the table.

Archie Bunker: His chest is all puffed out like Raquel Walsh.

Archie: Button your face.

Archie: You go off and leave me here with nobody home.
Edith: Mike was here.
Archie: Like I said, nobody was home.

Edith Bunker: Seems like an awfully long time to be showing her his

Archie Bunker: He's a strong kid there, this morning he bit right
  through a nipple. Luckily it was on a bottle or he could've hurt
  someone in the family.

Edith Bunker: What are you fighting about?
Mike Stivic: The Star-Spangled Banner.
Edith Bunker: Did the singer forget the words again?

Archie Bunker: In my bed I stay, 'til death us do part.

Edith: Ya can't depend on nothing no more.

Edith Bunker: I'm home. I'm home, Archie.
Archie Bunker: Are you sure?

Mike Stivic: What were you saying about colored families having no
  love?
Archie Bunker: Why is it you can remember everything except how to
  work?

Mike Stivic: In today's society, people throw things out because they
  don't work.
Archie Bunker: Well you don't work, maybe we should throw you out.

Archie Bunker: Silence is golden, so stifle thy self.

Fred Bunker: [on the phone] Hello, sweetheart, how's my little

Archie Bunker: You gotta grab the bull by the corns.

Edith Bunker: Remember Sister Kate, Archie?
Archie Bunker: That was that dumb movie about nuns starring Ingrid
  Bernstein.

Archie Bunker: Edith, if you call me "Cute" one more time, I swear
  I'll open a vein.

Edith Bunker: Maybe before I come to bed I should put on my socks.
Archie Bunker: Maybe before you come to bed you should stick your
  feet in the oven.

Mike Stivic: You eat my heart out. Little by little, bit by bit, you
  eat my heart out.
Archie Bunker: I don't care.

Archie Bunker: [commenting on a woman's perfume] It infiltrates the

Archie Bunker: Say there, Rosemarie.
Stephanie: Stephanie.
Archie Bunker: Whatever.

Paul: Shalom.
Edith Bunker: Shalom? What does that mean?
Mike Stivic: Believe it or not, Ma, it means "peace".
Gloria Stivic: Jewish people also use it to say "hello" and
  "good-bye".
Edith Bunker: How do you tell if they mean "hello" or "good-bye"?
Archie Bunker: Simple, Edith, If a Jew is walking towards you, it
  means "hello". If he's walkin' away, it means "good-bye".
Edith Bunker: When does it mean "peace"?
Archie Bunker: In between "hello" and "good-bye".

Archie Bunker: [telling the story of Samson] He took a jawbone from

Archie Bunker: We was like two ships that clashed in the night.

Archie Bunker: You'd better start mixing toothpaste with your

Archie Bunker: And didn't I bring you coffee up to bed like I do
  every Christmas morning?
Edith Bunker: Yeah, Archie.
Archie Bunker: All right. That shows you I ain't down. You got to be
  up to remember to do a thing like that once a year.

Archie Bunker: All over the world they celebrate the birth of that
  baby, and everybody gets time off from work. Now if that ain't
  proof that he's the Son of God, then nothing is.

Archie Bunker: She ain't gonna saying nothing more because the smoke
  has given her an attack of, what do you call, laryngosis.

[Door bell rings]
Edith Bunker: [Running] I'll get it!
Archie Bunker: Geez Louise Edith, why do you have to charge the door
  like a German shepherd every time the bell rings?

Archie Bunker: God can do anything! He can turn your jawbone into an
  ass!

Archie Bunker: For old time's sake, if I went up to the bath tub and
  caught a thousand legger, would you eat it?
Bummie Fensel: Archie, I was 11 years old. I don't do that no more.
Archie Bunker: Aw come on. Tell the truth, when was the last time you
  et a bug?
Bummie Fensel: December 7, 1941.
Archie Bunker: What kind was it?
Bummie Fensel: A Japanese beetle.

Archie Bunker: God don't make no mistakes, that's how He got to be
  God.

Mike Stivic: We're going to see something you know nothing about:
  culture. [Shows him the art exhibit book]
Archie Bunker: Oh ho ho, look at this. No wonder he's getting himself
  so excited, it's one of his own here: A Polack art exhibit.
Mike Stivic: That's 'Pollock'. Jackson Pollock. He happens to be a
  great American artist.
Archie Bunker: Well he sure paints Polish. Look at this: he splashes
  and smears the paint over everything here. What do you mean? A
  monkey could do that. A great American artist? There ain't a tree
  or a flag or a president in the whole damn book.
Mike Stivic: I'd explain it to you, Arch, but first you'd have to
  move your brain ahead two centuries.
Archie Bunker: Why don't you go take a short walk on a long pier?
Mike Stivic: Ha, you can't even get that right! It's take a long walk
  off a short pier.
Archie Bunker: Then do that.

Edith Bunker: I think he's right, Archie. Like, you haven't said the
  word "Coon" in almost a year.
Archie Bunker: What are you talking about? I say it everyday.
Mike Stivic: You haven't said it in front of us.
Archie Bunker: Alright then: Coon! Coon! Coon! You wanted it, you got
  it.

Archie Bunker: You're a regular Edgar Allen Polack.

Archie Bunker: Don't go blaming nothing on God that youse women brung
  on yourselves.
Gloria Stivic: What?
Archie Bunker: Yes, that's right. You don't believe me, read your
  Bible. Read the story about Adam and Eve there. Adam and Eve, they
  had it pretty soft out in paradise. They had no problems, they
  didn't even know they was naked. But Eve, she wasn't satisfied with
  all that, see? And one day against a direct order, she made poor
  Adam eat that apple. God got sore. He told them, "Get your clothes
  on and get the hell out of here".

Edith: What has four legs, and flys?
Archie Bunker: Two pairs of pants!

Mike Stivic: You can't do that, Archie! That's largesse!
Archie Bunker: I don't care if it's largesse, smallesse or any kind
  of esse!

[Edith discovers that Archie has been seeing another woman]
Edith Bunker: I don't want to be a Bunker.
Archie Bunker: If my dead father was alive to hear that, it would
  kill him.

[Archie is apologising for seeing another woman]
Archie Bunker: You got to believe me Edith, nothing was ever
  constipated.

[Archie and Edith are planning a trip to Disney World]
Mike Stivic: You know it just occurred to me - Mickey Mouse is black.
Archie Bunker: Aww get out of here with that! Mickey Mouse has no
  race. He stands for all men.

Edith Bunker: [Archie's in the bathroom] Archie! When are ya comin'
  out?
Archie Bunker: Why, ya sellin' the house?
Edith Bunker: You've been in there for 20 minutes.
Archie Bunker: Who are you? The official time-keeper?
Edith Bunker: What are ya doin' in there?
Archie Bunker: I'm changing the tile. One more word out of ya and I
  ain't never comin' out!

Edith Bunker: Don't ya like me bringin' home surprises?
Archie Bunker: Geez, Edith... with you a surprise could be anything
  from a runaway horse to a Puerto Rican.

Mike Stivic: Archie, if there *is* a God, how come there's so much
  unhappiness in the world?
Archie Bunker: If there is a God how come there's so much unhappiness
  in the world? Uh... uh... hey, Edith... If there *is* a God, how
  come there's so much unhappiness in the world?

Mike Stivic: That's what's wrong with this country; nobody asks
  questions any more!
Archie Bunker: Can I ask *you* a question?
Mike Stivic: Sure.
Archie Bunker: Why don't you shut up?

Gloria: Oh, Daddy. You'd put ketchup on a doughnut.
Archie Bunker: If it needed it.

Archie Bunker: Now don't go telling Lionel! He'll get on his tom-tom
  and alert all the other jungle bunnies.

Archie Bunker: [Edith has been to see Father Majeski, and Archie is
  afraid that he made her a Catholic without her knowing it] Think
  carefully now, Edith. Did he splash any water on you?
Edith Bunker: No.
Archie Bunker: Did he give you any beads to play with?
Edith Bunker: No.
Archie Bunker: Did he make you eat a cookie?

Archie Bunker: Like the Good Book says, "Let him who is without
  sin... be the rollin' stone."

Archie Bunker: I couldn't go to that thing even if I wanted to. We're
  supposed to be busy in here tonight.
Harry Snowden: I can handle it. I think you should go to the school
  show.
Archie Bunker: I hate school shows. I've hated school shows ever
  since I was this high. God, will I never forget. There was always
  some kid pounding a piano, and there was always some four-eyed
  sissy torturing a violin, a fat slob reciting "Trees", and then
  there was always the black kid singing, "My Yiddishe Mome".

Archie Bunker: I hate entertainment. Entertainment is a thing of the
  past, now we got television.

Mike Stivic: You can't go to the hospital, you're sick.

Mike Stivic: [Dialing the phone] What else? You only gave me six
  numbers.
Gloria Stivic: No, I gave you seven numbers.
Mike Stivic: One of those numbers was a sneeze. Do you see a sneeze
  on this dial?

Mike Stivic: Arch, you still need evidence.
Archie Bunker: What are you talking about? Look at all they put me
  through: look at the way I hurt all over. What about the sworn
  "testaphony" of your mother in-law, there? That's evidence, Buddy,
  we got a case and let me tell you something, a case like that could

Archie Bunker: Oh good, I can take anything off a spoon. I can't
  stand shots.

Doctor: You may have botulism.
Archie Bunker: What are you talking about? Nobody ever went crazy
  from eating mushrooms.

Doctor: Any lassitude?
Archie Bunker: No, she never puts any of that in the stew, only
  mushrooms.

Gloria Stivic: Did you call Dr. Nelson?
Edith Bunker: Yeah and he can't come, he says he don't feel well
  enough to make house calls. He says it sounds like both of you got
  the same thing,
Gloria Stivic: Oh no, you mean Dr. Nelson is sick too? Well what did
  you tell him?
Edith Bunker: I told him to take 2 aspirin and get plenty of rest.

Archie Bunker: Just like that Ralph Nader, you're giving the whole
  country a pain in the butt.
Mike Stivic: Arch, you ought to be grateful for Ralph Nader. Do you
  realize that before 1968 there were hardly any cars recalled for
  being defective? But in 1972 there were nearly eight million cars
  recalled?
Archie Bunker: And do you realize that in 1974: who cares?

Archie Bunker: Do you know how many brands of mushrooms are sold all
  over this here country?
Edith Bunker: Oh, thousands.
Archie Bunker: Alright, and how many cans do you think are bought?
Edith Bunker: Millions.
Archie Bunker: So what do you think the chances are of me getting the
  one bad can out of all them millions of cans? What is it? 100 to
  one.
Mike Stivic: What is that? The new math?

Mike Stivic: Now take it easy, don't panic.
Archie Bunker: Will you stay out of this? Now take it easy, don't
  panic.

Mike Stivic: I think we should check the cans and see what brand they
  were.
Archie Bunker: Why don't you stay out of this? Edith, we gotta check
  the cans and see what brand they were.

Archie Bunker: The bosses of that company ought to taste every
  mouthful of food before it leaves the factory.
Mike Stivic: How are they going to do that?
Archie Bunker: What do you mean how? Ain't you never heard of the
  olden days in the days of kings? The king used to have a special
  cook to taste the food. The cook dropped down dead, the king said,
  "See?" Then the king went back in the kitchen and made a sandwich
  for himself.

Nurse: You wanna stand up?
Archie: Yeah sure. Okay. I feel right as rain. Tell 'em they can keep
  the ambulance in the garage.

Archie Bunker: [Seeing a Chinese man at the blood bank] They're a
  yellow race.
Mike Stivic: And so naturally they've got yellow blood? Look there's
  an Irish man with green blood. Hey look over there, there's
  Governor Rockefeller.
Archie Bunker: Where?
Mike Stivic: There, the guy with the blue blood.

Archie Bunker: Well if all blood's the same, let me ask you this: how
  come they ain't got no Swedes in the mafia?
Mike Stivic: What does that got to do with anything?
Archie Bunker: Because your Italians got a lock on it. That's why.
  It's in their blood. Same way it's in your blacks' blood to do the
  'scooby-dooby-doo'.

Archie: [after seeing the bag filled with the blood he has just
  given] Is that mine?
Nurse: Not anymore.

Archie Bunker: I was in the war. The big war, you know. It was nice
  over there in Italy. Say, you wouldn't be one of them senoritas,
  would ya? You could be what with the dark hair and dark eyes and
  all.

Archie Bunker: Not against His will.
[Points skyward]
Mike Stivic: What does 'His will' have to do with it? Since when did
  He get into it?
Archie Bunker: He was never out of it. When He calls, you gotta go.
Gloria Stivic: Unless modern medicine saves you.
Archie Bunker: It can't.
Mike Stivic: Sure it can. It does all the time.
Archie Bunker: That's when He wasn't really calling, but when He
  calls, you gotta go. He don't want no quack doctors down here
  trying to save you. It throws His schedule all off. If you throw
  off His schedule, when you get up there you gotta answer to him.
  He's gonna want to know from you, why you didn't come when you was
  called. Why you was late. And you also gotta answer to the guy
  whose heart you got. He's gonna want it back so you'll be walking
  around Heaven with a hole in your chest.

Archie: They put a woman's heart in a man's body.
Mike Stivic: So?
Archie: So, it's hard enough for a man and woman to live together in
  the same house, never mind the same body.

Edith: [playing Monopoly] Aw, I gotta go to jail.
Archie: Make it solitary confinement.

Edith Bunker: What's the matter, Mike?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: I don't know. Something's missing.
Edith Bunker: Not enough salt?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Not enough Archie. It's too quiet around
  here.
Gloria Bunker-Stivic: Michael, don't tell me you like arguing with
  Daddy.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: I didn't say I like it, it's just I'm used
  to it. My body's used to it. When Archie's here, I eat better.
Edith Bunker: Well don't worry, Mike, he's only working overtime
  tonight. Tomorrow he'll be home at his regular time, and I'm sure
  he'll get in a nice argument with you.

Edith Bunker: I'll never forget the first time I made pot roast for
  your father. Only he wasn't your father then, we was just keeping
  company. I invited him to my house for dinner and I made him pot
  roast. And that was the first time he ever called me "dingbat."
Gloria Bunker-Stivic: Well that's awful, even if he didn't like your
  cooking.
Edith Bunker: Oh, no, he loved it.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Then why'd he call you "dingbat"?
Edith Bunker: Well in them days, Archie was too shy to call me
  "sweetheart" or "darling," so he called me "his little dingbat."
  [Smiling sweetly] And you know what, ever since then, no matter how
  mad he says "dingbat," I always hear a little "sweetheart" in it.

Archie Bunker: Look at me. Work hard all my life and what do I have
  to show for it? This job could mean a thousand bucks a year extra
  for the two of us.
Edith Bunker: Aw Archie, money ain't that important.
Archie Bunker: Yeah, not to Rockefeller it ain't, 'cause he's got it.

Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Arch, when you were talking with Ma the
  other day about Manifest Destiny, did you mention the fact it was
  just another name for American imperialism?
Archie Bunker: Hah?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: That's right. It was just an excuse to rip
  off other people's land. That's the way we stole Texas from Mexico.
Archie Bunker: [Points his finger at Michael] Listen, Subversive. The
  U S of A never stole nothin' from nobody. The Mexicans was only too
  glad to give us Texas after we beat the hell out of 'em in a war.

Archie Bunker: The Indians don't vote.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Archie, the Indians were given the vote in
  1924.
Archie Bunker: I ain't talking about that, I'm saying they don't use

  booze and then they can't ride into town.

Archie Bunker: Holy cow, a purse! Aw, that's just gorgeous there. [to
  Gloria] Did you buy him matching pantyhose?
Gloria Bunker-Stivic: You're really sick.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Archie, this is a bag to carry things in.

# "All in the Family" (1968) {Archie and the Editorial (#3.1)}
[Archie is delivering en editorial on a local TV station]
Archie Bunker: [on TV] Good evening, everybody. This here is Archie
  Bunker of 704 Hauser Street, veteran of the big war, speaking on
  behalf of guns for everybody. Now, question: what was the first
  thing that the Communists done when they took over Russia? Answer:
  gun control. And there's a lot of people in this country want to do
  the same thing to us here in a kind of conspiracy, see. You take
  your big international bankers, they want to - whaddya call -
  masticate the people of this here nation like puppets on the wing,
  and then when they get their guns, turn us over to the Commies.
Edith Bunker: Oh, Archie, I'm glad they put you on a stool, you look
  taller sitting down.
Archie Bunker: [on TV] Now I want to talk about another thing that's
  on everybody's minds today, and that's your stick-ups and your
  skyjackings, and which, if that were up to me, I could end the
  skyjackings tomorrow.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: You could?
Archie Bunker: [on TV] All you gotta do is arm all your passengers.
  He ain't got no more moral superiority there, and he ain't gonna
  dare to pull out no rod. And then your airlines, they wouldn't have
  to search the passengers on the ground no more, they just pass out
  the pistols at the beginning of the trip, and they just pick them
  up at the end! Case closed.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: That's incredible, Arch.

[Archie and Mike are arguing about gun control]
Archie Bunker: All I know is, I'm an American and it's my right to
  pack a rod!
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Bull!
Archie Bunker: Whaddya mean, bull to the constitution?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: It doesn't say that in the constitution,
  Arch, I'll prove it to you! I got a copy in my history book!
Archie Bunker: Look it up! It's right there in your Second Amendment!
Edith Bunker: Oh, no, Archie, that's the one that says "thou shalt
  not make any graven images."
Archie Bunker: That ain't the Second Amendment, Edith. What you says
  is the Gettysburg Address.

Gloria Bunker-Stivic: Daddy, did you know that sixty percent of the
  people murdered in this country in the last ten years were killed
  by guns?
Archie Bunker: Would it make you feel any better, little girl, if
  they was pushed out of windows?

Gloria Bunker-Stivic: Daddy, how can you be against gun control with
  all the assassinations? Look at it, the Kennedys and Martin Luther
  King. And what about the shooting of Governor Wallace?
Archie Bunker: I'm saying maybe Governor Wallace wouldn't have gotten
  shot if he had a rod in his mitt!
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: What?
Archie Bunker: Because the Governor was there, he coulda shot first!
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Archie, what would he be doing walking
  around in a crowd with a gun?
Archie Bunker: What was the other bum doing in the crowd with the
  gun?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: That's ridiculous, Archie! You're talking
  about a human being who may be in a wheelchair for the rest of his
  life.
Archie Bunker: Yes, and if that human being had a rod, then the other
  human being would be in the wheelchair!

Archie: Three Men in a Tub, they had a water shortage in them days.
  So everything in Fairyland was in threes, you know, except the
  dwarfs. There was seven of them 'cause they was little and the wolf
  was after them so the wolf came running after them and boy he had
  one hell of a breath. He blew down their house and they had to find
  another joint so they run through the woods and they run into
  Goldilocks and she took them all in to live with her and there's
  nothin' wrong with that because she was a nice girl and they're old
  anyway. So they got another house but the wolf came along and blew
  that one down too so then they run through the woods again and they
  come to a brick house and that belonged to Disney so they all moved
  in there and started working for him.

Archie: [singing] London Bridge is falling down, falling down,

Archie: You think I never changed you, little girl?
Gloria: If I had waited for you to do that, I would've worn the same
  diaper since I was two. Ma told me that.
Archie: Don't believe your mother, you believe me. Many is the time I
  changed you, little girl, and it wasn't always wee-wee. Sometimes
  it was this here.
[Holds up two fingers]
Gloria: Well I never promised you a rose garden.

Babysitter: Baby oil.
Archie Bunker: And how many table spoons are you supposed to give it?
Babysitter: You rub it on, you don't feed it to them.

  bedight. Whatever that means.

Babysitter: Mr. Bunker, maybe you'd feel better if you sat for your
  grandson.
Archie: I would but I have a poker game going on.
Babysitter: Well what's more important: a poker game or your
  grandson?
Archie: Don't be fresh.

Archie: I don't want you reading these books here. Anthropology?

Beverly LaSalle: I'm a female impersonator.

  female than a woman?

Beverly LaSalle: I was just telling your wife that I'm no lady.
Archie Bunker: How you earned this 50 is no business of mine.

  never thought I'd be saying this, but YOU'RE too good for HER!

Edith Bunker: [to Archie, after he finds out that Gloria had an
  affair] No matter what she done its none of your business.
Archie Bunker: What're you talking about; its the world's business.
Edith Bunker: No, it ain't the world's business neither.

Cousin Maude: Archie, you can either get up and eat breakfast, or lie
  there, feeding off your own fat. [pause] And if you choose the
  latter, you could probably lie there for months.

Archie Bunker: [Maude refuses to get out of Archie's chair] Well, I
  got the secret weapon that can lay this little lady right away.
  Here we go. This country was ruined by Franklin Delano Roosevelt!
Cousin Maude: You're fat.
Archie Bunker: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but Franklin
  Delano Roosevelt...
Edith Bunker: Archie, you promised never to say that name again in
  front of Maude.
Archie Bunker: Franklin Delano Roosevelt!
Edith Bunker: [to Maude] He don't mean nothing. His whole family was
  for Roosevelt.
Archie Bunker: That was for two terms. But that was it. We didn't
  know the guy was going to hold on to the job like a pope!

Cousin Maude: [after Maude sings to wake everybody up] Are you
  waiting for a special invitation? I said breakfast is on the table.
Archie Bunker: I heard ya. So did every moose up in Canada.

Archie Bunker: Well, let me tell you one thing about Richard E.
  Nixon. He knows how to keep his wife, Pat, home. Roosevelt could
  never do that with Eleanor. She was always out on the loose.
  Running around with the coloreds. Tellin' 'em they was gettin' the
  short end of the stick. She was the one who discovered the coloreds
  in this country; we never knew they was there!

Archie Bunker: Roosevelt sold us out to Joe Stalin at Gibraltar.
Maude: They met at Yalta.

Gloria Bunker-Stivic: Mother!
Edith Bunker: Well, so long as it ain't too severe.

  don't believe in capital punishment: Suppose you was to come home
  some fine day and find your wife's throat cut. Now are you gonna
  tell me you wouldn't be itching to fry the guy who cut that throat?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: No, what good would that do?
Archie Bunker: [to Gloria] Do you see this guy? You see what you
  married? Some fiend could come in here and murder you and he ain't
  gonna lift a finger to help!
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Archie, if I killed that murderer, would
  that bring Gloria back? No. An eye for an eye is not the answer.
  The problem rests with society.
Archie Bunker: He's always blaming everything on society! Listen, if
  you're gonna blame society for murder, what we ought to do is turn
  the killer loose, give him a pension for life, and go out and shoot
  the rest of the city!

Archie, Mike: Dope.

Mike Stivic: Arch, did you get Ma a gift?
Archie Bunker: Certainly I got her a gift. She's my wife. What did I
  get her, little girl?

Gloria Stivic: No, no, no, don't you see, she expects me to wish her
  a happy birthday because it's something that I always do. But it's
  something you never do so she doesn't expect it from you. But if I
  don't say anything, when she expects me to say something because
  you don't want me to, then she's gonna know something is up because
  I haven't said anything when I should have. And if you say
  something, which I don't want you to do, when you're supposed to
  and you shouldn't have then Ma's gonna know something is up because
  you said something. Don't you see? Don't you understand?
Archie Bunker: You get more like the old lady every day.

Archie: Hey, little girl, does your fish ever so often come out of
  water and lay on a rock?
Gloria: No.
Archie: Then he's dead.

  you tell me?

Archie Bunker: Don't holler the word RAPE.

Archie Bunker: Are you all right in there?
Mike Stivic: Yeah, I just slipped on some cake. Hey, the cake tastes
  burnt.

Edith: I hit him with my cake.
Archie: Thank God you had something heavy.

Archie Bunker: Don't hit the knee that got hit with the trolley.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Edith's Accident (#2.7)}
Michael Stivic: How could a can of cling peaches do so much damage?
Edith Bunker: [thoughtfully] Maybe it was the heavy syrup.

Father Majeski: "Go from the presence of the foolish man when thou
  perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge."
Archie Bunker: What does that mean?
Father Majeski: It means don't waste your time arguing with an idiot!

Archie Bunker: All right, Meathead. Go up and get your tape recorder.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: What are you going to do, start playing
  Attorney General?
Archie Bunker: Don't argue with me, huh? Just get the tape recorder.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Are you going to tell this man you're
  taping his conversation?
Archie Bunker: Does J. Edgar Hoover tell anybody?
Gloria Bunker-Stivic: If you don't tell him you're taping him, you're
  depriving him of his civil rights.
Archie Bunker: He ain't colored, he's Polish!
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Archie, you're violating his rights under
  the First Amendment.
Archie Bunker: Whose side are you on anyhow, huh? Look at me, I know
  I got a lot going against me, I'm white, I'm Protestant, I'm
  hard-working. Can't you find one lousy amendment to protect me?

[Archie opens the door to the person whose car Edith dented, only to
  find he is a Catholic priest]
Father Majeski: I'm John Majeski.
Archie Bunker: You're kidding.
Father Majeski: No, no, I'm Father John Majeski. May I come in?
Archie Bunker: Yeah, yeah, yeah, come in, Father, sure. I'd like you
  to meet my family, there, that's my wife Edith, here, that's my
  daughter Gloria, here. And that's my son-in-law Mike Stivic over
  here.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Still want the tape recorder, Arch?
Archie Bunker: Dummy up, you.

Archie Bunker: I think we're in luck. This guy is a phony.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: How do you know that?
Archie Bunker: Don't you ever read the papers? About all them
  unflocked priests running around? This priest here ain't kosher,
  and he never was!
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: How do you know?
Archie Bunker: Did you see the lousy-looking suit he's wearing there?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: So what, Arch? Maybe it's the only suit he
  owns.
Archie Bunker: Are you kidding? The Catholic Church owns half of the
  property in New York, including some of your finest clothing
  stores.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Archie, if you have your doubts, why don't
  you just ask him for his credentials?
Archie Bunker: Come on, how the hell you gonna do that?
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Simple. You just walk up to him, and say,
  "Father, can I see your cross?"

Archie Bunker: I says, "Edith, Darling, what is, is" and then I said,
  "Edith, Darlin, what was, was". And finally, I say, "Edith,
  Darling, what's going to be, is going to be". But your mother
  in-law don't know nothin' about philosophy.

Archie: [about Beverly LaSalle] I wish I could've told her what a
  nice fellow she was.

Edith Bunker: I gotta get the cranberry sauce.

Edith Bunker: You hate Emily!
Archie Bunker: No, no, no, no, I don't, Edith. I don't hate Emily. I
  never said that, I never said that at all. No, I like her, and I
  like their little home in Scranton, there, and those four cute
  teenagers. I think her husband is a real nice guy, and I, I can't
  say that... I can't go on like this, that's one thing I can't do! I
  can't believe a word of anything I'm saying around here! This ain't
  natural! No, I don't like her, and I don't like her husband! He's a

  I hate their four rotten kids! And the only way you're gettin' me
  to go to Scranton is if some screwball hijacks the airplane! I know
  all about your women's troubles there, Edith, but when I had the

Mike Stivic: Ask him if he sells dinosaur insurance.

Edith Bunker: [There's a fire in the house] And our family picture
  albums.

  entire race of people and not just the Chinese, the Laotians, the
  Cambodians, the Vietnamese.
Archie: Wait a minute, Meathead, I never call them countries Chinks.
Edith: He calls them Gooks.
Archie: I'm saying they're all a yellow race. They ain't exactly
  Chinks, but they are definitely offshoots of your Chinks, they're
  what you call Chinkish.

Archie Bunker: Edith, I'm always nice. Go let the jerk in.

Mike Stivic: So you must be Mr. Bunker.

George Jefferson: It ain't an IOU; just go ahead and sign it.
Archie Bunker: Hold it, hold it, Jefferson. I don't go around signing
  political documentaries just like that, ya know. Even Abe Lincoln,
  smart as he was, he read the Declaration of Independence before
  putting his John Hancock on it.
Edith Bunker: Archie, are you sure Abraham Lincoln signed the
  Declaration of Independence?
Archie Bunker: Yeah, fourscore and seven years ago.

  shove yours.
[Exits]
Archie Bunker: You know, a guy could take that two ways.
Mike Stivic: Knowing Lionel, I'm sure he only meant it one way.

Archie Bunker: I been thinking this whole thing over, and you can't
  leave. 'Cause you can't go to school at night, work at the same
  time, pay for an apartment, support a wife and a baby, see? Now to
  begin with, you ain't got the brains. The boy didn't even have the
  brains to keep himself from getting pregnant.
Mike Stivic: Archie, I've been trying to tell you something. We're
  not pregnant anymore.
Archie Bunker: Will you let me finish? You what?
Mike Stivic: Well, we're not gonna have a baby now.
Archie Bunker: You big dumb Polack, did you do something illegal?

Archie Bunker: Let me ask you something there, about George. I mean,
  how did that happen to him? When he was a baby, uh, did somebody
  throw him up in the air and forget to catch him?
Mr. Bushmill: [sighs] It's a common birth defect. The doctors call it
  anoxia. It means he didn't get enough oxygen when he was born. Now

  lie.
Mike Stivic: You know something Archie, just because a guy is
  sensitive, and he's an intellectual and he wears glasses, you make
  him out a queer.
Archie Bunker: I never said a guy who wears glasses is a queer. A guy
  who wears glasses is a four-eyes. A guy who is a fag is a queer.

[Archie finds out the Jeffersons have bought the house next door]
Edith: I think it's wonderful.
Archie: Oh you'll think it's wonderful when the watermelon rinds come
  flying out the window.

Archie: [Archie is explaining to Lionel why blacks shouldn't move
  into the neighborhood] They ain't gonna be happy here. What are
  they gonna do? What are they gonna do for recreation? There ain't a
  crap game or a pool hall in the whole neighborhood. There ain't a
  chicken shack or a rib joint within miles.
Lionel Jefferson: No ribs? Lawd All Mighty, what is we gonna do?


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Lionel Steps Out (#3.5)}
Archie Bunker: [Answering the door to Mr. Jefferson] I didn't order
  you on the phone, I ordered your brother.
Henry Jefferson: Well, what you see is what you get.
Archie Bunker: Well, I got something here for you to see. [Holds up
  picture of Lionel Jefferson and Archie's niece Linda] I want to
  know what your family is gonna do about him? [Points to Lionel]
Henry Jefferson: [Holding up his own copy of the same picture] Well,
  I want to know what your family is gonna do about her?
Archie Bunker: You ain't even the head of your family. Why didn't
  Lionel's father come over here?
Henry Jefferson: You don't want to know the answer to that.
Archie Bunker: Yes I do.
Henry Jefferson: Alright. He said he "ain't never stepped into a
  honky's household," and he "ain't about to start at the bottom of
  the heap."
Archie Bunker: Jefferson, I don't like that.
Edith Bunker: He said you wouldn't like it.

Archie Bunker: Let's cut the funnies out, huh. This is very serious.
  You know what I'm saying to you. I'm saying, that youse guys ought
  to stick with yourselves.
Lionel Jefferson: You mean guys ought to stay with guys?
[laughter]
Archie Bunker: You know what I'm talking about Lionel. I'm saying
  that whites ought to stay with whites aaand, coloreds ought to stay
  with coloreds.
Lionel Jefferson: Look Mr. Bunker. Its been a year and a half now
  since we moved into this neighborhood. I was just 19 then and I got
  a big kick out of you and me for a long time. But I'm pushing 21
  now and I'm not getting that big a kick out of it anymore.
Archie Bunker: Alright Lionel, put lid on all of that.
Lionel Jefferson: No, no, wait, I'm not finished, now... now, we've
  been friends and we can go on being friends. But when it comes to
  black and white and all the other wonderful thoughts you have in
  between... put a lid on that Archie.

Archie Bunker: I have you into my house, there, you break bread with
  me and then you go and do a thing like this, thank you very much,
  Lionel.
Lionel Jefferson: You mean me taking out Linda?
Archie Bunker: Yes.
Lionel Jefferson: Oh you don't have to thank me for that, Mr. Bunker.
  I'd do it again but she's leaving tomorrow.
Archie Bunker: Let's cut the funnies. You know what I'm saying to
  you. I'm saying that youse guys ought to stick with yourselves.
Lionel Jefferson: You mean guys ought to stay with guys?

Archie Bunker: If God had intended whites and coloreds to dance
  together...
Mike Stivic: He'd had given us rhythm too.

Archie: Why did the Irish farmer pour alcohol on his vegetable crop?
  Because he wanted to have stewed tomatoes.

Henry Jefferson: Let them mix the races but we're gonna keep ours
  pure. No more cream into the coffee.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Lionel the Live-In (#5.5)}
George Jefferson: I don't want no daughter-in-law who's a zebra.
Louise Jefferson: Why not? I'm sure she won't mind a father-in-law
  who's a jackass.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Lionel's Engagement (#4.20)}
Edith Bunker: [as Mike and Gloria put away their coats] Ohhhh, you
  came home at just the right time.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: You mean dinner's ready?

George Jefferson: [George has just learned that Lionel's fiancée
  Jenny's father is white] What about your children? What are they
  gonna be?
Lionel Jefferson: Boys and girls, I hope!

George Jefferson: [watching the Willises have an argument] See that,
  Weezie! That's what happens when you mix black and white! Watch, in
  another minute, he's gonna call her a nigger!
Archie Bunker: Geez, I ain't used that word in ten years.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Little Miss Bunker (#9.1)}
Archie: [Floyd has asked the Bunkers to look after Stephanie] Tell
  him he's barking up the wrong tree.
Edith: You're barking up the wrong tree.
Archie: You heard the boss.
Edith: We'd love to take in Stephie.

Floyd: Gee Arch, I hate to ask for help.
Archie: Good, 'cause I hate to give it. Especially if it's money.
Floyd: Oh no, this ain't about money.
Archie: Then you got a chance.
Floyd: I need you to watch Stephanie for a few weeks.
Archie: You had a better chance at money.

Stephanie Mills: I'd like to go to the John.
Edith Bunker: We're going to the John.
Archie Bunker: I heard.
[to Floyd]
Archie Bunker: "John"? Couldn't you have taught her to say "toilet"
  like educated people?
Floyd Mills: I try the best I can.
Archie Bunker: Well you failed.

Hooker: Hey there, chief, you want some fun?
Archie Bunker: I don't like fun, I'm a maniac.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Meet the Bunkers (#1.1)}
Archie Bunker: Now wait a minute, Meathead, I never said your black
  beauties was lazy. You don't believe me, look it up.
Gloria Stivic: He's prejudice, there's no hope for him at all.
Archie Bunker: I ain't prejudice, any man deserves my respect and
  he's gonna get it regardless of his color.
Mike Stivic: Then why are you calling them black beauties?
Archie Bunker: Now that's where I got you, wise guy, there's a black
  guy who works down at the building with me, he's got a bumper
  sticker on his car that says 'Black is Beautiful' so what's the
  matter with black beauties?
Edith Bunker: It's nicer than when he called them coons.

Archie Bunker: I stopped in the gent's room the other day, so help me
  there was a man in there with a ponytail. My heart nearly turned
  over, I thought I was in the wrong toilet.

Lionel Jefferson: [Archie comments on the three-piece suit he's
  wearing] I also got a yellow one with stripes and a purple one with
  checks for when I'm with MY people.

Archie Bunker: If your spics and your spades want their rightful
  share of the American dream, let 'em get out there and hustle for
  it like I done.
Mike Stivic: So now you're going to tell me the black man has just as
  must chance as the white man to get a job?
Archie Bunker: More, he has more... I didn't have no million people
  marchin' and protestin' to get me my job.
Edith Bunker: No, his uncle got it for him.

Archie Bunker: Back in my day, they wasn't called Chicanos or
  Anglo-Americans or Afro-Americans, we was all Americans so if a guy
  was a jig or a spick, it was his own business.

Archie Bunker: I used to know a whole flock of them coloreds in the
  old neighborhood. One went by the name of Roundtree Cummerbatch.
Mike Stivic: You never knew anybody by that name. You made it up.
Archie Bunker: I made up a name like Roundtree Cummerbatch?
Mike Stivic: That's right, you made it up to put down a black man.

Archie Bunker: Look at this water bill - eighty dollars! My luck I
  got the only Polack that showers regular.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Mike Faces Life (#6.7)}
Archie Bunker: That ain't the American Way, buddy. No, siree. Listen
  here, professor. You're the one who need an American History
  lesson. You don't know nothin' about Lady Liberty standin' there in
  the harbor, with her torch on high screamin' out to all the nations
  in the world: "Send me your poor, your deadbeats, your filthy." And
  all the nations send 'em in here, they come swarming in like ants.
  Your Spanish P.R.'s from the Caribboin, your Japs, your Chinamen,
  your Krauts and your Hebes and your English fags. All of 'em come
  in here and they're all free to live in their own separate sections
  where they feel safe. And they'll bust your head if you go in
  there. *That's* what makes America great, buddy.

Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: [On the phone] I still can't find an
  apartment.
Archie Bunker: That's because you're looking with a bag over your
  head.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Would you leave me alone?
Archie Bunker: Try Jersey.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: I *hate* Jersey!
Archie Bunker: *Everybody* hates Jersey! But somebody's gotta live
  there.

Archie: Well, you know what they say, Edith. Birds gotta fly, fish
  gotta fry.
Edith: Swim.
Archie: That too.

[Mike has climbed into bed with Archie and accidentally spilled water
  on him]
Archie: You got into bed with me to do this here?
Mike Stivic: It was an accident.
Archie: With Little Joey it's an accident. With you, it's a
  dishonorable discharge.

[Mike slips into the bed with the sheets tucked in]
Archie: I don't believe what I just seen there. You slid in there
  like a card into a time clock.

Archie Bunker: She ain't a fire starter. She ain't like your Emperor
  Negro who fiddled while Rome burned.

Mike Stivic: Arch, what did your Cousin Oscar die of?
Archie: I think he died of bad feet.
Mike Stivic: Nobody dies of bad feet.
Archie: I dunno, he was always complaining that his feet were killing
  him, so...

Mike Stivic: I'm sorry to get you out of bed.
Edith Bunker: Oh that's all right, we was only sleeping.

Archie Bunker: Wait a minute, we don't wanna know what happened
  there. Don't tell us what happened, we don't want to know. Tell him
  we don't give a damn what happened, right?
Edith Bunker: Right. What happened, Mike?

Mike Stivic: Gloria said I ruined her life.
Archie Bunker: I told her the same thing seven years ago.

Archie Bunker: Where the hell is going to sleep, with Teresa?
Edith Bunker: No, Teresa can sleep in our bed.
Archie Bunker: Up against you or up against me?
Edith Bunker: Oh no, see, Archie, you'll sleep in Teresa's bed in
  Mike's old room and I'll ask Teresa to come and sleep with me in
  our bed in our room, and Mike will sleep on the cot in Teresa's
  room which used to be Mike's room where you'll be sleeping. See,
  you won't have to sleep up against nobody, see?
Archie Bunker: If I could figure that one out, I'd be sleeping up
  against a straightjacket.

Archie Bunker: He ain't been the same since he had that vassexomy.

Mike Stivic: You were right, Honey, I am a meathead. Not only that,
  I'm a pompous ass.

Mike Stivic: Your spelling is atrocious.
Gloria Stivic: Atrocious?
Mike Stivic: Yeah, can you spell that?
Gloria Stivic: Atrocious. M-E-A-T-H-E-A-D. Atrocious.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Mike and Gloria's Will (#7.10)}
Archie Bunker: Little boys who play with dolls grow up to be other
  boys' roommates.

Archie Bunker: I would take will into court and have it thrown out.
Mike Stivic: On what grounds?
Archie Bunker: On the courtroom grounds under the windows.

Archie Bunker: Wait 'til you hear this, Edith. They decided not to
  will Joey to anyone, and you know why? 'Cause they decided they
  ain't never gonna die.

Archie Bunker: You're supposed to be the big bug on the Constitution,
  right? Well the first amendment guarantees that baby the right to
  bear a machine gun?
Mike Stivic: The first amendment guarantees free speech.
Archie Bunker: Same thing, buddy boy. If you got a gun in your hand,
  you're free to make any speech you want to.

Archie Bunker: I'm gonna give this to somebody else.
[tries to take the doll away from Gloria and in the process pulls its
  head off]
Gloria Stivic: Aah! Daddy! Well I can't give it to Joey like this.
Archie Bunker: Alright, maybe you can find some poor, deserving
  little kid who would like a 'decrapitated' pee-pee doll.

Mike Stivic: You've moved us through three cars already.
Archie: There was a gang war in the first car.
Mike Stivic: What gang? It was three kids fighting over a strap to
  hold onto.

  from that strap.

Paul Goodrow: But wouldn't Mr. Bunker agree that God is everywhere?
Archie Bunker: Tell him He certainly is.

  nothin', not 'til the wedding night.
Edith Bunker: Yeah, and even then...

Archie Bunker: [after being sung awake] I musta died and gone to the
  wrong place. 'Cause yas all sure sound like hell.

Gloria Stivic: Robin's burning incense. I think it smells nice.
Archie Bunker: It smells like a house of Ill Refute.

Archie Bunker: Well in the words of Harry S. Truman, if it's too hot
  in the kitchen, stay away from the cook.

Archie: What kind of fathead would send us something like this?
Edith: It's from your mother.

Jeff: Hey, what's happenin', Man?

  even.


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Mike's New Job (#8.22)}
Archie Bunker: Don't you know that California is sitting on a shelf
  out there, they call that the Pacific Shelf. There's three states
  on that shelf: Oregon, California and Missouri. When the big
  earthquake hits, all them three states are going to be shoved right
  off that shelf there. They call that the Continental Divide.
Mike Stivic: What?
Archie Bunker: Yes. The Pope knew about this years ago. He said it
  was St. Andrew's fault.

Archie Bunker: California is full of nuts and fruits. Every fruit is
  a little nutty and every nut is a little fruity.

Archie Bunker: George Jefferson is the only black guy I know that
  calls Abe Lincoln a honky.

Kate Korman: And then say something like, because of your skill and
  alertness, a man walks the good Earth, breathing God's clean air.
Archie Bunker: Not if he's walking around New York he ain't.

Edith Bunker: Well, see, I figured that he was having a heart attack
  and I had some training in CPR that's Cardiopulminary
  Resessitation. It was on that TV show 60 Minutes once.
Archie Bunker: We watch all of them high class, educational shows
  right through, no matter how exhausted we get.

Edith Bunker: Archie was just trying to help.
Kate Korman: Help? He's done nothing but get in the way.
Archie Bunker: Say that again.
Kate Korman: You are in the way!
Archie Bunker: You didn't have to tell me twice.

Archie Bunker: Alright, that's it. I'm in the way. I'll get the hell
  outta here, go down to Kelsey's. Oh no, no, I don't wanna stick
  around here with Wanda Kronkite over there. However, before I
  leave, I'll say one more thing: I would like to give you a little

Archie Bunker: [to Edith] Open up a fresh box of Twinkies for Mr.
  Davis.
Sammy Davis Jr.: Twinkies?
Michael Stivic: Yeah, kind of a WASP soul food.

Archie Bunker: Mr. Davis, do you take cream and sugar in your eye?

Archie Bunker: Now, no prejudice intended, but I always check with
  the Bible on these here things. I think that, I mean if God had
  meant for us to be together, he'da put us together. But look what
  he done. He put you over in Africa, and put the rest of us in all
  the white countries.
Sammy Davis Jr.: Well, he must've told 'em where we were because
  somebody came and got us.

Sammy Davis Jr.: If you were prejudiced, Archie, when I came into
  your home, you would have called me a coon or a nigger. But you
  didn't say that, I heard you clear as a bell, you came right out
  and said it: "colored". And if you were prejudiced, you'd go around
  thinking that you were better than everybody. But after spending
  these wonderful moments with you, Archie, I can tell ya - you ain't
  better than nobody.
Archie Bunker: [extends his hand] Can I have your hand on that, Mr.
  Davis?

Archie Bunker: You was born black, so you didn't no choice about
  that. But, why'd you turn Jew?

Gloria: I'm sorry, Mr. Davis, sometimes my father says the wrong
  things.
Sammy Davis Jr.: Yeah, I've noticed that.
Lionel Jefferson: But he's not a bad guy, Mr. Davis. I mean like,
  he'd never burn a cross on your lawn.
Sammy Davis Jr.: No, but if he saw one burning, he's liable to toast
  a marshmallow on it.

Archie Bunker: Now, no prejudice intended, but I always check with
  the Bible on these here things. I think that, I mean if God had
  meant for us to be together he'd a put us together. But look what
  he done. He put you over in Africa, and put the rest of us in all
  the white countries.

  thinking that you were better than everybody. But after spending
  these wonderful moments with you, Archie, I can tell ya - you ain't
  better than nobody.
Archie Bunker: Can I have your hand on that, Mr. Davis?

Archie: When Sammy Davis Jr. get's here, don't say nothing about his
  eye.
Edith: What eye?
Archie: One of them is glass. You'll find out which one when he get's
  here, now don't say nothing about it. Now you got any fried chicken
  out in the kitchen? 'Cause they like to snack on that.

Mike Stivic: So when Sammy Davis gets here, are you gonna call him a
  jungle bunny?
Archie Bunker: Certainly not. I'll call him Mr. Davis.
Mike Stivic: What's the difference between him and our neighbor
  Lionel?
Archie Bunker: 10 million dollars and several Catillacs.

Archie Bunker: Guess which famous personality I had in my cab?
Edith Bunker: Oh, this is fun. Living or dead?
Archie Bunker: I was driving a cab, Edith, not a hearse.

Archie Bunker: Hey, Edith, open a fresh box of Twinkies for Mr.
  Davis.
Sammy Davis Jr.: Twinkies?

  Davis Jr.'s glass eye] Now Mr. Davis, do you take cream and sugar
  in your eye?

Archie: Certainly I looked in the top drawer.
Edith: Well they ain't in the top drawer.

Archie Bunker: Here's my argaroll socks straight from California,
  made in Taiwan.
Stephanie: Is Aunt Rose is still sick?
Archie: No, she has D-Y-E-D.
Stephanie: You mean D-I-E-D. D-Y-E-D means she changed color.
Archie: She probably done that too.

Archie Bunker: And remember, don't talk to strangers unless you know
  them very well.

Edith Bunker: Stephie, you can stay with us forever.

Edith Bunker: I guess Stretch must have been Jewish.
Archie Bunker: Stretch Jewish? With a name like Cunningham?
Edith Bunker: Oh, well, Archie... what's in a name?
Archie Bunker: A Jewish name ain't supposed to have no "ham" in it.

Archie Bunker: I'll tell ya, though, the thing that makes me feel bad
  is all them mean things I was saying about his matinees, and all of
  that, you know? He could've been dead right when I was complaining
  about him, Edith. Hey, maybe he even heard me.
Edith Bunker: Oh, no, he couldn't have heard you, especially if he
  was dead.
Archie Bunker: Dead is the time when the spirit hears things, Edith.
  How do you know that Stretch's spirit ain't here right now,
  listening to every word we say, right here in this room.
Edith Bunker: But he lived in the Bronx!
Archie Bunker: His spirit didn't have to stay in the Bronx! Jeez, if
  you was his spirit, would you stay in the Bronx?

Archie Bunker: I can't go through with this. Edith, Edith, I'm no
  good at this. How would you like to see me just louse up poor
  Stretch's funeral?
Edith Bunker: Oh, Archie, you ain't gonna do that. You've been to
  lots of funerals.
Archie Bunker: I know, I know, Edith, but I ain't never delivered a
  urology.

Archie Bunker: Stretch was always one of the uppest guys you ever
  met, see. Always laughing, telling jokes himself. Many a Jewish
  joke he told. He told the one about the priest said to the rabbi...
  he told about the priest said to the rabbi, "How come you never eat
  no ham?" The rabbi said, "It's against my religion. How come you
  never go out with a girl?" And the priest said, "it's against my
  religion." And the rabbi said, "You ought to try it. It's better
  than ham."

[Mike is an atheist]
Archie: Did you ever in your life tell somebody to go to Hell?

Archie: So where did you want them to go, Disneyland?


# "All in the Family" (1968) {Teresa Moves In (#7.9)}
Archie Bunker: I changed my mind. I don't want no stranger in the
  house. He'd probably snuggle girls up the stairs.
Edith Bunker: Well suppose the 'he' is a she?
Archie Bunker: You wouldn't want that either.

Archie Bunker: [on a female boarder] Get one with the flat chests and
  big feet who want nothing out of life other than to work hard and
  pay the rent.

Edith: But in the hospital you said having a boarder was a good idea.
Archie: But I was so full of pills and enemas, I didn't know if I was
  coming or going.

Teresa: Mr. Bunkers, could you turn down the sound please?
Archie Bunker: You can't do that. You can't enjoy it unless you hear
  the victims screaming.
Teresa: I don't mean the sounds from the TV, I mean the sounds from
  you.
Archie Bunker: Oh, don't pay no attention to me, I always holler at
  the monster pictures there. Particularly this frog picture. I seen
  it 4 or 5 times.
Teresa: The frog can't hear what you say. It's a fake frog. It's a
  fake lamp post, it's a fake building, it's a fake movie.

Archie Bunker: You just spoiled my whole evening.
Teresa: [Puerto Rican accent] Well you spoiled my study time.
Archie Bunker: Well you, 'espoiled' my frog picture.
Teresa: You making fun of my English?

  Plymouth? Let me call Dr. Kurtsman who glides around in a Lincoln.

Dr. Sidney Shapiro: That girl needs her appendix taken out. If you
  want a second opinion, take her to the hospital and have it done
  there.
Archie Bunker: But I want a second opinion to see if she should go to
  the hospital.

Edith Bunker: [about Dr. Sydney Shapiro] He was so smart. He had
  always wanted to make a bat.
Archie Bunker: A ball bat?
Edith Bunker: No, a real bat. He wanted to cross a mouse with a bird.
Archie Bunker: THAT'S the genius you got working on our kid in there?

Archie Bunker: I nearly killed the child.
Edith Bunker: You couldn't help it if her appendix burst.
Archie Bunker: Who said young Dr. Shapiro shouldn't do it? Who said
  old Dr. Shapiro should? Who thought we should get Dr. Kurtsman -
  who never called me back from the Copa Cabana. Who done all them
  stupid things?
Edith Bunker: You did.

Archie Bunker: We'd barely have enough strength to drag ourselves
  over the hill to the bone orchard.
Edith Bunker: I ain't going to no bone orchard.
Archie Bunker: If I go, you go.

Mike Stivic: [to Archie] In the last election you didn't like Carter,
  you didn't like Ford so he wrote in Richard Nixon.

Edith: Archie, did you really write in "Richard Nixon"?
Archie: Of course not. I wrote in Reagan.

Archie Bunker: I wanna make sure I get my ten simoleons out of you
  when I win that bet. 'Cause your baby Linda ain't gonna win. She's
  too fat to win. In a few years time, she's gonna be a teenage bus.
Barney Hefner: Well all I have to say is too bad it wasn't a baldy
  contest.
Archie Bunker: You hear that, he's always on the baldy thing over
  here. You're gonna lose an old friend that way, Barney.
Mike Stivic: That's competition for you: two best friends ready to
  bust each other in the chops over who's got the most beautiful
  grandchild.
Barney Hefner: Hey, you know what just occured to me about little
  Joey? I mean since he's got those long, beautiful eyelashes? You
  should've entered him as a baldy girl.
Mike Stivic: Hey. Watch what you're saying, that's my son.

Archie Bunker: Hit him below the belt, he's over the hill.

Archie Bunker: You're gonna get Reagan in 1980, wise guy!

Edith Bunker: [Edith has just broken up a fight between Mike and
  Gloria] When I was a little girl, my mother and father got into a
  terrible fight that started just because there wasn't enough maple
  syrup for my father's pancakes.
Michael 'Meathead' Stivic: Ma, what we're arguing about is a little
  more important than maple syrup.
Edith Bunker: Just a minute! I ain't finished! They didn't talk to
  each other for three whole weeks! And even after they made up
  things was never the same between them. Now I know that maple syrup
  is just a little thing, but would you rather break up over

Archie Bunker: Well, I don't know - if some of them young hotheads
  down at the plant get their way. I don't know what some of these
  guys want. They're asking for staggered work shifts, lounges with
  pictures on the walls, and books. The want to turn the factory into
  a house of pleasure. They don't want to work - they're a bunch of

  greatest pictures ever made. If I was the Japs, I would give that
  picture the Jap Academy Reward.

Archie Bunker: Can you believe a family of midgets by the name of the
  Bambinis?
Gloria Stivic: No.
Archie Bunker: Sure. You couldn't tell the parents from the kids

  they don't wanna get killed! And that's why we leave it to the
  Congress, cause them old quacks ain't gonna get killed! And they're
  gonna do the right thing, and get behind the president and vote
  yes!

  Your opinion is more important than anyone else in this room. And I
  wanna hear that opinion - I want these young people here to hear
  that opinion! Now you tell 'em, Pinky, you tell 'em.
Pinky Peterson: I understand how you feel, Arch. My kid hated the
  war, too. But he did what he thought he had to do. And David here

Sgt. Blair: You like those old stereotypes, huh?
Archie Bunker: Best types of all! They didn't waste no time bringing

Archie Bunker: I don't know, the nose is a pretty strong thing. One

Archie Bunker: You know Edith, the whole damned rest of the world
  could go to the dogs, but as long as I got you standing by my side,
  or sitting by my side, or lying like this, by my side, I'd be
  alright. Oh Edith, I've been blowing my own horn for a long time,

  leave the room or open a window, but that's not gonna paralyze

  be wrong?
Archie Bunker: My old man? Don't be stupid. My old man? Let me tell
  you, he was never wrong about nothing.
Mike Stivic: Yes he was, Arch. My old man used to call people the
  same things as your old man. But I knew he was wrong. So is your
  old man.
Archie Bunker: Don't tell me my father was wrong. Let me tell you
  something, a father who made you is wrong? A father, the
  breadwinner of the house there? The man who goes out and busts his
  butt to keep a roof over your head and clothes on your back you
  call him wrong? Father, that's the man that comes home, bringing
  you candy. Father is the first guy to throw a baseball to you. And
  take you for walks in the park holding you by the hand? My father
  held me by the hand, hey, my father had a hand on him though I tell
  you. He busted that hand once, and he busted the other on me to
  teach me to do good. My father, he shoved my in a closet for seven
  hours to teach me to do good, 'cause he loved me. Don't be looking
  at me. Let me tell you something, you're supposed to love your
  father 'cause your father loves you. How can any man who loves you
  tell you anything that's wrong?

Archie Bunker: You know the story about Noah's Ark there, don't you?
  You know how the animals come up the gangplank there and into the
  ark. They came in twos: the sames with the sames and the differents
  with the differents. The tiger come up with the tigeress, the lion,
  he came up with the lioness. The zebra, he come up with the
  zebraella and the elephant, he came up with the... Uh... What?
  Geez, I forget the term. You know, the point I'm trying to make is
  the elephant didn't come walking up there with a Polack.

Archie Bunker: You don't trust nobody out there except your own kind.
  You remember that, Meathead.
Mike Stivic: That's another thing. Meathead. Why must you always call
  me Meathead?
Archie Bunker: What the hell... Why does that bother you? I'll bet I
  wasn't the first to call you 'Meathead'.
Mike Stivic: You were the only one to ever call me Meathead. They
  never called me that in school. They called me Michael or Mike, or
  Mickey.
Archie Bunker: Well, what a sweet little school you went to there.

Mike Stivic: What did they call you in school?
Archie: Different things.
Mike Stivic: Tell me, what did they call you in school?
Archie: Well, I remember one winter during the Depression when we
  didn't have any money because my father lost his job, we was all
  bust. And I wore out a shoe. One shoe. So I couldn't go to school
  with only one shoe. But my mother found a boot, so I had a shoe on
  one foot there and a boot on the other. A shoe and a boot. So the
  kids call me 'Shoebootie'.
Mike Stivic: They used to call you 'Shoebootie', huh?
[laughs]
Archie: They used to holler, "Tutti fruitti, here comes Shoebootie."
  They called me that until they learned my name was Archibald and
  they thought that was funny. And then I wished they'd go back to
  'Shoebootie'.

Mike: The kids all made fun of you, huh?
Archie: Yeah, they all made fun of me. Except for this one little
  black kid named Winston.
Mike: A black kid liked you?
Archie: No, the black kid beat the hell out of me.
Mike: Why? He must have had a reason.
Archie: Well he said that I said he was a "nigger".
Mike: Did you?
Archie: Sure. That's what all them people were called in them days.
  Everybody we knew called them people niggers. It's all my old man
  called'em there. What the hell was I supposed to do? I didn't know
  what to call them. I couldn't call him a Wop. I couldn't call him
  Wop, 'cause Wop is what we called the Dagos.

Mike Stivic: Good night, Shoebootie.

  Watergate thing it's been GD this and GD that.
Archie Bunker: I didn't swear. GD. The first word is God. How can
  that be a swear word? It's the most popular word in the bible. The
  second word, damn, that's a perfectly good word, you hear it all
  the time, like they dam the river to keep it from flooding it. And
  you read in the Bible that some guy was damned for cheating or
  stealing or having insex in the family. And who damned him? Who
  else? God. God damned him. Edith, beautiful words right out of the

Mike Stivic: Why is Jefferson number 2?

Archie Bunker: [playing Monopoly] Mortgage some of your houses there
  or sell your property.
Blanche Hefner: No, if I do that I'll lose money and I won't collect

Barney Hefner: It's not a matter of cheap, it's against the rules of

  suspected.

Archie Bunker: Some red nail polish, Edith? Why didn't you just buy
  her some rouge, high heels and a lamp post.

Archie Bunker: Do you know the kind of money it takes to raise a
  child? You know, yanking out the tonsils and the adenoods.
  Straightening the teeth, straightening the eyes.

  why...why are you getting so worked up over a dream?
Tia Jewel: Because it's not a dream, it's reality. I marry you, I
  marry Neesee. I guess that makes sense because it feels like I've
  been dating her for the past year and a half. I go to school, she's
  there. I come home, she's here. I go to your office, she's there.
  And now, we go to sleep, and boom, there she is, right in our bed.
Robert James Sr.: Tia, I don't enjoy having Neesee around all the
  time. But she and I have a son together.
Tia Jewel: I know, and I love him. But I guess I didn't realize how
  much his mother was going to be a part of our lives...until now.
Robert James Sr.: What do you mean, until now? It's always been like
  this.
Tia Jewel: Not really. Because, baby, now she's in your dreams and
  showing up in mine.
Robert James Sr.: Look, baby, I know what you're saying, okay? But,
  this is not...you're overreact...
Tia Jewel: When you asked me to marry you, I just took that ring, put
  it on, and I said yes, because I love you so, so much. But I guess
  I didn't take the time to think how things would really be between
  us. And when I say "us," I mean ALL of us. And baby, you didn't

Marjorie Wilde: So, you finally decided to tell the truth?
Rosamund Grant: What would you know about that?

Agatha Troy: Ros couldn't have murdered Charles. She really loved
  him.
Chief Inspector Alleyn: Well, I'm sorry, Troy, but in my experience
  love is a very powerful motive for murder.


# "Alleyn Mysteries" (1990) {Dead Water (#2.2)}
Emily Pride: [to Alleyn] For someone who's not exactly disgraced
  himself in the intelligence service, you're very transparent,
  Roderick.

Agatha Troy: [Referring to Alleyn] I think he just wants you to take
  his advice, that's all.
Emily Pride: Oh, men always do, but I've got to a reasonably advanced
  age by ignoring most of it, and you haven't got to be doing what
  you do by taking men's advice, have you?

Major Keith Ballantyne: [to Alleyn] You're a little bit posh for a
  copper, aren't you? I've met your type before. Swanky armored
  regiments thinking they're cavalry with horses.
Chief Inspector Alleyn: I'm still a copper.
Major Keith Ballantyne: Yes. [Turns and walks away]

Brigadier: [about Miss Pride] She's not scared of stickin' her neck

Chief Inspector Alleyn: Time to look under a few stones to see what's
  underneath.
Inspector Fox: I thought it was time for lunch.

Abel Pomeroy: Fox, what are you looking for?
Inspector Fox: Anything that may have been overlooked.

Chief Inspector Alleyn: [Last lines] [Looking at a sketch of the
  murderer] There's our man. He was a man who created his own
  darkness.


# "Alleyn Mysteries" (1990) {Final Curtain (#1.3)}
Agatha Troy: [Seeing Alleyn with a pineapple] Is that for me?
Chief Inspector Alleyn: Flowers have a tendency to wilt.
Agatha Troy: I haven't seen one of these in years. Perhaps I'l use it
  in a still life.

Fenella Cairnes: [Dramatically] I'll say no more, but there's badness
  in this house. [as she goes out the door] You'll see.
Agatha Troy: [Unimpressed by the dramatics] Fenella, you did that
  very well.

Millamant Ancred: I gave up the theater for him. It's still in my

Desdemona Ancred: I always think that when Gladys Cooper went to

Chief Inspector Alleyn: Sir Gerald?
Gerald Lacklander: What?
Chief Inspector Alleyn: [Referring to an earlier expression he used]
  Plain as a pike stuffed?
Gerald Lacklander: What?
Chief Inspector Alleyn: The identity of the Colonel's killer?
Gerald Lacklander: [Impatient and annoyed] That disgusting little
  sewer rat Phinn! Use thumbscrews! Of course, he'll talk!

Gerald Lacklander: What? My entire damn warddrobe?
Chief Inspector Alleyn: No, just what you were wearing... what
  everyone was wearing when the colonel was murdered.
Lady Lacklander: I can't think of anything more disgusting than
  peering over other people's mucky clothes, but if that's what you
  wan't. that's what you'll get.

Chief Inspector Alleyn: But they're all holding something back.
Inspector Fox: Yes, and this Lady L's keepin' mum about her private
  chat with the Colonel, and Sir Gerald [laughs]... why he looks as
  though he's got a ferret down his trouser... [laughs again]
Chief Inspector Alleyn: [Tongue in cheek] I don't think Sir Gerald
  would notice if he had a ferret in his trousers.

Lady Cecily O'Callaghan: It's only my tolerance that kept our
  marriage and his career intact.

Chief Inspector Alleyn: I have friends, Brad. I don't have pull.

Chief Inspector Alleyn: If it isn't murder, somebody's been awfully
  careless.

Chief Inspector Alleyn: Ask Robinson to come in, will you? And go out
  without making a joke.
PC Perkins: Ah, that would be one, sir.

Nurse Jane Harben: I loved him, but I could have killed him. Love is
  like that, isn't it? Close to hate... All I know is, his going has
  left a hole in my life... One has to be careful of holes... You can
  fall in them.

Inspector Fox: [about Nurse Harben] She loved him. I sometimes wonder
  what women are made of.
Chief Inspector Alleyn: They often wonder that themselves, but... so
  I'm told.

Sir John Phillips: This is very irregular, Chief Inspector!
Chief Inspector Alleyn: So is murder, Sir John.

Chief Inspector Alleyn: [Last lines] Do you know, Brad, I sometimes
  think madness is an extreme kind of sanity.


# "Ally McBeal" (1997)
Ally McBeal: There's no sin in loving men. Only pain!

Ally McBeal: We're not only wired to want what we can't have, but
  we're also wired to want what we really don't want.

Ally McBeal: You only die once!

Ally McBeal: When guys are persistent, it's romantic, they make
  movies about that. If it's a woman, then they cast Glenn Close.

Billy: Why do therapists always have to talk about sex?
Dr. Hooper: What can I say, Freud was a perv.

Ally McBeal: Law and love are the same - romantic in concept but the
  actual practice can give you a yeast infection.

Ally McBeal: I'm trying to desensitize myself to murder so I can be a
  better lawyer.
Billy: Why don't you just watch the news?

John "The Biscuit" Cage: Let's not forget that Lizzie Borden was
  found innocent of killing her parents.
Richard Fish: Oh, she did it; the jury just took pity on her for
  being an orphan.

Ally McBeal: I like being a mess. It's who I am.

Richard Fish: You're not who you are, you're only what other people
  think you are. Fishism.

[a judge has just denied his motion]
Richard Fish: Let the record show: dammit.

Nelle Porter: You having fun with this case?
Ling Woo: It's okay. I prefer being a plaintiff, but a defendant's
  nice too. I get a martyr glow.

Ally McBeal: I've been dumped before, Renee. This isn't pain I'm
  feeling, it's nostalgia.

Judge Jennifer "Whipper" Cone: No, I don't think you're nuts, but I
  don't think that you have both feet on the ground either.
Ally McBeal: You mean some people do?

Renée Radick: People think you're strange, you know. Just, just sit
  there and don't talk.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: I am an enigma.
Renée Radick: You're a cute little enigma.

Renée Radick: Well, don't get me wrong, Ally...
Ally McBeal: Why does everyone say that to me? Do I get everything
  wrong?
Renée Radick: No, it's just that what I am about to say may sound
  like an insult, so I want to buffer it.
Ally McBeal: Oh, okay.
Renée Radick: Emotionally, you're an idiot.

Ally McBeal: I mean, with all due respect, you sort of walk around
  with uppity breasts, and the hair flips aren't the most subtle. And
  your perfume - you could be flammable. Now what if somebody shut
  you down as a safety hazard, how would you feel then?
Elaine Vassal: That was with all due respect?

Elaine Vassal: A lot of people forget what they're saying in a fit of
  rage, so I'll be happy to take the minutes.

Elaine Vassal: Ally's depressed about her birthday. I know, I've been
  listening in on her phone calls.

Elaine Vassal: I'd call her a tramp, were I one to judge.
Ally McBeal: Yes, were you one.

Elaine Vassal: Sometimes she just *looks* snappish.

Elaine Vassal: Snappish!

[about Santa Claus]
John "The Biscuit" Cage: A fat man, trying to squeeze through a
  narrow chimney, and I taunt him with Oreos and whole milk.

[Ally's psychiatrist plays a tape of people laughing]
Dr. Tracy Clark: Sometimes when a patient says something so competely
  naive, I find that my own laughter just isn't enough.

Elaine Vassal: She's two-thirds of a Rice Krispie treat. She's
  already snapped, and crackled, and she's ready for the final pop.

Richard Fish: Is that the two cents? I'd be looking for change.

Georgia Thomas: Well, by all means let's hear your opinion, Richard.
Richard Fish: Simple. Men and women. Friction.
Georgia Thomas: That's it? Friction?
Richard Fish: Friction, friction, friction, orgasm. Fishism. Are we
  going to dance or not?

Ally McBeal: Even if I did get past all my problems, I'm just gonna
  get out and get new ones.

Ally McBeal: Remember, when you're with me, it's the only time you're
  not the strangest person in the room. So go ahead, get weird with
  me.

Elaine Vassal: In a pinch, I sometimes allude to not wearing any
  underwear.
Ally McBeal: I won't be in that pinch.

Georgia Thomas: Ally, what makes your problems so much bigger than
  everybody else's?
Ally McBeal: They're mine.

Ally McBeal: We're women. We have a double standard to live up to.

Rabbi Stern: Are you always such a bitchy little thing?
Ally McBeal: Bitchy?
Rabbi Stern: Coming in here, insulting the Talmud, insulting me!
Ally McBeal: What kind of rabbi calls somebody bitchy?
Rabbi Stern: I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Ally McBeal: 'Cause I'm bitchy? God has no love for the bitchy?
Rabbi Stern: Get out.

Ally McBeal: I am good in bed, Renee. [Renee laughs] What?
Renée Radick: Ally, I'm your roommate. We have thin walls, and you...
[Renee imitates small whining noises]
Ally McBeal: I don't sound like that.
Renée Radick: I make more noise breaking in a new shoe.

Ally McBeal: So how has it come to this? We're smart women, we're
  fairly attractive...
Renée Radick: I'm even hot.

Richard Fish: She told her that you told her about what she told you.
  I'm in the middle and clueless. I feel like Elaine.

Elaine Vassal: I'm sure she's quite stupid, and in time, gravity will
  get her.

John "The Biscuit" Cage: The world is no longer a romantic place.
  Some of its people still are however, and therein lies the promise.
  Don't let the world win, Ally McBeal.

Greg: You kicked him?
Ally McBeal: I didn't know he was real; I thought he was pretend.
Greg: You only kick pretend people?
Ally McBeal: [pause] Yes.

Elaine Vassal: That was a snappish remark disguised in a soft tone.

Ally McBeal: Maybe I'm happy and I just don't know it.

Ally McBeal: The real truth is, I probably don't want to be too happy
  or content. Because, then what? I actually like the quest, the
  search. That's the fun. The more lost you are, the more you have to
  look forward to. What do you know? I'm having a great time and I
  don't even know it.

Ally McBeal: You loved me.
Billy: Yeah. That's the truth. So much that sometimes, when we were
  apart, we used to keep an open phone line at night so while
  sleeping I could listen to your breath.

Richard Fish: "Problem" is just a bleak word for challenge.

Ally McBeal: Sometimes... there's no point in the truth if the only
  thing it will do is cause pain.

Ally McBeal: The idea that when people come together, they stay
  together. I have to take that with me when I'm going to bed at
  night, Even if I'm going to bed alone.

Ally McBeal: Men are like gum anyway - after you chew they lose their
  flavor.

Richard Fish: Everybody's alone. It's just easier to take in a
  relationship.

Richard Fish: Helping others is never more rewarding than when it's
  in your own self interest.

Richard Fish: Let me tell you something. I didn't become a lawyer
  because I like the law; the law sucks. It's boring, but it can also
  be used as a weapon. You want to bankrupt somebody? Cost him
  everything he's worked for? Make his wife leave him, even make his
  kids cry? Yeah, we can do that.

Ally McBeal: Sometimes I'm more persuasive when I lack conviction.

Ally McBeal: Uh, let the record reflect that the deponent is a fat,
  arrogant, overweight, bald pig.

Richard Fish: Make enough money, and everything else will follow.
  Quote me. That's a Fishism.

Elaine Vassal: Oh, forgive my bluntness. It's a device I use to cope.

Ally McBeal: Whenever I get depressed, I raise my hemlines. If things
  don't change, I am bound to be arrested.

Richard Fish: You know, I had a great aunt once who said if you stare
  at a beautiful woman too long, you turn to stone. She was partially
  right.

Ally McBeal: [about Billy] He wants to have his cake and not eat me.

Ally McBeal: A thigh seemed innocent as parts go.

Ally McBeal: Hi! I'm Ally McBeal, homewrecker. Here's my card.
Georgia Thomas: I already have it, thanks.

Ling Woo: I am really a very funny person.

Dr. Tracy Clark: You kissed him? You're a slut!
Ally McBeal: I... I am not! I am not a slut!
Dr. Tracy Clark: Oh, come on! Don't fool yourself!

Ling Woo: It's a problem being beautiful. It's only the handsome men
  that ask us out because they're the only ones who think they have a
  chance. And handsome men are dolts. Life is unfair to us. At some
  point we have to face the certain reality: despite all the good the
  world seems to offer, true happiness can only be found in one thing
  - shopping.

[on Elaine]
Ling Woo: This woman drips with sarcasm at my personal expense.
Nelle Porter: Ling, one of the disadvantages of having magnetism is
  that you bring people out, people that otherwise would go
  unnoticed. The fact that she can be so annoying is really a tribute
  to you!

Ling Woo: Nelle is like a sister; when she's in pain, I throw up!

John "The Biscuit" Cage: [to Nelle] I'd sooner puke my intestines and
  snorkel in them than see you naked.

Ling Woo: I'm rich. I only go into work to wear my outfits!

John "The Biscuit" Cage: I'm not going through an odd phase, I really
  am odd.

Ally McBeal: Wow... I have a boyfriend.

[Watches Nelle Porter unpin her bun and shake out her long, beautiful
  blonde hair]
Ally McBeal: It's official: I HATE her!

Ally McBeal: Love isn't always enough.
Larry: Yeah, it is. You go without it long enough and you realize
  it's everything.

Renée Radick: A penis is not a share toy.

Ally McBeal: Here I am, the victim of my own choices. And I'm just
  starting.

Georgia Thomas: At the end of the day, life is just this big wall of
  reality that we all crash into.

John "The Biscuit" Cage: Have no fear, Nelle, that girl is a bagel!
Nelle Porter: Bagel?
John "The Biscuit" Cage: [pauses] I meant to say 'toast.'

Ally McBeal: Maybe I'll share my life with somebody... maybe not. But
  the truth is, when I think back of my loneliest moments, there was
  usually somebody sitting there next to me.

Ling Woo: So Jackson Duper, you don't tell a woman your real name?
Jackson Duper: Hey, for all I knew...
Ling Woo: You knew me well enough to go to bed with me.
Jackson Duper: Look...
Ling Woo: Why the alias? You wanted?
Jackson Duper: No.
Ling Woo: Certainly not by me.
Jackson Duper: Excellent. Do I get to talk?
Ling Woo: Fine. Quick, think up something.
Jackson Duper: Look...
Ling Woo: We're back to look.
Jackson Duper: Hey...
Ling Woo: We're back to hey.
Jackson Duper: Ling...
Ling Woo: How do you know my real name? Oh that's right, I *gave* it
  to
  you. What an odd thing to do.

[Ally is outraged when Ling convinces a dying boy that he could sue
  God]
Ling Woo: Do you know how his father died?
Ally McBeal: No. Do you?
Ling Woo: Yes, I overheard the nurses talking. He was crushed by a
  tree that was struck by lightning. THAT was an act of God, so we go
  after the Church, HOUSE of God. I need to pee. [exits]
Ally McBeal: Where does she come up with these things?
Nelle Porter: Well, Ling wasn't editor of law review for nothing.
Ally McBeal: Ling went to Law School? Ling is a LAWYER?

Liza Bump: [to Nelle Porter] Do you talk, or do I have to pull a
  string?

Richard Fish: [defending a client for attempted murder] Adrenaline
  can be like a drug, can't it, Dr. Burns? Ever know adrenaline to
  work on the brain like a drug?
Dr. Burns: Certainly, but...
Richard Fish: Thank you. And in your career as a doctor, have you
  ever been - um, how do I say this - uh, wrong?
Dr. Burns: Wrong?
Richard Fish: Yes. In all your years and many diagnoses, have you
  ever been wrong?
Dr. Burns: Of course, but... I'm *not* wrong *here*.
Richard Fish: You're a doctor who's been wrong, right?
Dr. Burns: I am not wrong *here*.
Richard Fish: But you've been wrong, yes or no?
Dr. Burns: I already said yes, I have been wrong on some occasions.
Richard Fish: And on those occasions when you've been wrong, did you
  know it at the time?
Dr. Burns: [long pause] No.

Cindy McCauliff: My penis makes you nervous.

Judge Dennis 'Happy' Boyle: Members of the jury, our witness has a
  small piece of spinach caught in an incisor. Now, when oral decay
  starts to build up between the tooth and the gum, bacteria starts
  to build colonies. Even the most nutritious vegetable can turn into
  Vietnam.

[Ally, Georgia, and Billy arguing with Richard]
Richard Fish: Hold on! Quiet! Let me ignore you one at a time.

Ally McBeal: [on her wardrobe] Men are constantly trying to mentally
  un-dress me. I'm just trying to save them some time, that's all.

Richard Fish: John? John, y- you got the biggest booger. Oh, sorry,
  it's a frog. Bygones.

John "The Biscuit" Cage: Men lie to get women into bed. Women lie to
  get men into matrimony. Those are the simple facts of life.

[explaining his remote control toilet flusher]
John "The Biscuit" Cage: Sometimes people leave in haste, forget to
  flush. Other times, there are residual remnants. I like a fresh
  bowl.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: My regularity's easily thrown. Unclean
  bowls... trouble me.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: I like a fresh bowl and remnants upset me.

John "The Biscuit" Cage: Love. We all want it. Don't all get it. I
  remember telling my mother in high school I wanted to wait for the
  perfect girl. And she replied, "Idiot! Even if you found her, she
  might be holding out for the perfect man." She also said I wouldn't
  recognize love unless it bonked me on the head. And I retorted,
  "Well, why don't you come along with me, mom, and if you see love,
  you hit me on the head so I'll know." It was difficult as a young
  man taking my mother on dates. And then, one night, not a date
  night, but just one evening, I turned to my mom and, as i looked
  into her eyes, I could see... she was dead. She'd passed on quietly
  from an aneurysm, right there at the table. All she said was, "Ip."
  Sitting in a chair: a quiet little "Ip". It was her request to have
  her last words put on her tombstone. And I see people at the
  cemetery snickering when they read: "Joanna Cage. Beloved Mother.
  Ip." I miss my mother. Even though she's not here... I know she's
  still with me, smiling down on me... hoping I'll find love.

Renée Radick: Snow White. Cinderella. All about gettin' a guy. Being
  saved by the guy. Today it's the Little Mermaid, Aladdin,
  Pocahontas. All about gettin' a guy.
Ally McBeal: So basically we're screwed up because of...
Renée Radick: Disney.

[catch-phrases]
John "The Biscuit" Cage: I'm fraught.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: I need to take a moment.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: Unacceptable!
John "The Biscuit" Cage: Repugnant!
John "The Biscuit" Cage: Balls!
John "The Biscuit" Cage: That disparaged me.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: I will not stand to be disparaged.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: I'm troubled.
John "The Biscuit" Cage: I'm drawn to her.

Richard Fish: Bygones.

Richard Fish: Vulgarism.
Richard Fish: Bugger.
Richard Fish: Ouch!
Richard Fish: Kidding.
Richard Fish: No biggie.

Raymond Millbury: [to Elaine] You're cute, in a slutty way.

Billy: Will you ever forgive my letting go?
Ally McBeal: I'll forgive it. But I'm still not sure I'll ever
  understand it.

Richard Fish: There's no rule that says you have to wake up.

Ally McBeal: Sometimes... when you hold out for everything, you walk
  away with nothing.

Ally McBeal: I can't believe my life. One minute it's going okay, I
  mean... as okay as my life can get, then the gong knocks me
  completely off my feet.

Ally McBeal: Looking backwards, many of the saddest times in my life
  turn out to be the happiest. So I must be happy now. Yeah. This is
  gonna be good. Why else would I be crying?

Ally McBeal: You've seen me dance. Now watch me fornicate.

  And that's all that counts. It's all that will ever count. All my

John Cage: Bye now.
Helena Fisher: She seems nice.
Larry Paul: She's a sweetheart.

John Cage: [answering his mobile phone] Hello? What do you mean
  you're going into court?
Richard Fish: I got it all at Radio Shack, John. And I've got a
  miniature earpiece and the mike fits on my lapel. It should be
  easy.
John Cage: Well, don't - don't be ridiculous, Richard. I can't argue
  your case for you over the phone.
Richard Fish: No, you don't. You feed *me* the arguments. Just like
  that show. Uh, what was it? Cyrano de Burger King? Whatever.

Margaret Camaro: I don't condemn you for wanting somebody to love. I
  guess I just reject the notion that your life is empty without a
  man.
Ally McBeal: It's only half-empty.

Billy Thomas (Bellows, Gil): Ally, as your friend...
Ally McBeal: ...you will support me. Thank you.


# "Ally McBeal" (1997) {Just Friends (#3.10)}
Richard Fish: She said that?
John "The Biscuit" Cage: Yes!
Richard Fish: Well, so, she had a dream. That doesn't...
John "The Biscuit" Cage: No, it's not the dream! She was suggesting
  that she and I explore being a couple. And Richard, I have to admit
  I've always harbored feelings for Ally.
Richard Fish: Oh, gee, there's a flash. Look, John, there ARE ethical
  considerations here. The only question you have to ask yourself is:
  Can you sleep with Ally without Nell finding out?

[to Richard Fish]
John "The Biscuit" Cage: You know, it's just that simple with you,
  isn't it? Sex sex, sex sex sex! It's waddle with Whipper versus
  knee pit with Ling. Boy, you put the Fish in "superficial", dammit.

Liza Bump: [facetiously] Please don't make me try this case. I'm not
  prepared!

John Cage: [regarding Liza Bump] All right. Your Honor, let the
  record reflect she just grazed my johnson.

[after Liza Bump leaves]
Nell Porter: John? We have to get that little bitch.
John Cage: Have no fear, Nelle. She is a bagel.
Nell Porter: A bagel?
John Cage: I meant to say toast. No fear.

Liza Bump: I am through fooling around with you people. The longer
  this trial goes, the worse it gets for you. If you let it *keep*
  going, YOUR client will end up having to pay us.
Liza Bump: [to John Cage] I'm sure you used to be good. Today? You

Richard Fish: [sighs] Ally, did we know each other in law school?
Ally McBeal: Not... really.
Richard Fish: Mmm-hmmm. Did I interview you for the job?
Ally McBeal: No.
Richard Fish: Did I ask to see a reference or a transcript?
Ally McBeal: No.
Richard Fish: So, all I had to go on was looks. Why bite the hand
  that wants to touch you?
[Richard fingers Ally's wattle, she slaps him away]
Ally McBeal: So, this had nothing to do with my ability as a lawyer.
Richard Fish: What ability? I'm still looking for that. Kidding.
  Ally, you, Ling, Nelle, you're smart. You wouldn't be here if you
  weren't. But you have to remember, people hate lawyers. The clients
  think their lawyers are only out to screw them. It's just easier
  being screwed by a beautiful woman. Vulgarism, but ...
Ally McBeal: [turning to walk out] I can't believe this.
Richard Fish: Don't tell me you don't trade on your looks every day,
  Ally. You wake up each morning, you pull out the lip gloss, the
  rouge, the blush. What for, to brush up your intellect?

John "The Biscuit" Cage: I have to prepare my final statement, you
  ungrateful little PIMP.
[Ling gasps]

Richard Fish: Your Honor, if I may...
Judge Seymour Walsh: Oh, Dear God!
Richard Fish: Almost EVERY woman is BOUGHT. It's good that these kids
  learn that at a young age.
Judge Seymour Walsh: Mr. Fish -
Richard Fish: Tell me women don't become interested in men because of
  the size of their wallets. We see beautiful young girls walking
  around with 80-year-old men on WELFARE all the time, don't we?
  People in this country are seduced by success! Fancy car, big

Ally McBeal: Well, does it have to make sense? I mean, the best
  things don't. Do they?
John "The Biscuit" Cage: Such as?
Ally McBeal: Love... Beauty is another - it's in the eye of the
  beholder. Even humor doesn't make sense, when you think about it -
  sense of humor? Who can explain what people find funny? I mean, to
  me, it's the insistence on making sense that doesn't make sense.

  love song to somebody that you've never met but you know is out
  there. And I know, I mean, we make so few promises to ourselves as
  we grow up and one of these is that we walk down the aisle with
  somebody we love, somebody who does make your heart bounce, I
  guess. And there are some promises that I think we just have to
  keep.

Jackson Duper: First, you're kissing me.

John Cage: The law is the law, Liza. And she *broke* it.
Liza Bump: John, in some states, oral sex is against the law. You
  don't see people getting thrown in jail for that.
John Cage: Bigamy is a little more serious.
Liza Bump: [coyly] You don't take oral sex seriously?
John Cage: [flustered] We're both on the same side here. Would you
  please STOP trying to RATTLE me?
Liza Bump: Oh, yeah. Force of habit.

Judge Seymour Walsh: Mr. Cage. Ms. Bump. I'll ask you to proceed
  without the nonsense.
